1001001,1,1,1,In the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the earth --
1001002,1,1,2,"the earth hath existed waste and void, and darkness `is' on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God fluttering on the face of the waters,"
1001003,1,1,3,"and God saith, `Let light be;' and light is."
1001004,1,1,4,"And God seeth the light that `it is' good, and God separateth between the light and the darkness,"
1001005,1,1,5,"and God calleth to the light `Day,' and to the darkness He hath called `Night;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day one."
1001006,1,1,6,"And God saith, `Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.'"
1001007,1,1,7,"And God maketh the expanse, and it separateth between the waters which `are' under the expanse, and the waters which `are' above the expanse: and it is so."
1001008,1,1,8,"And God calleth to the expanse `Heavens;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day second."
1001009,1,1,9,"And God saith, `Let the waters under the heavens be collected unto one place, and let the dry land be seen:' and it is so."
1001010,1,1,10,"And God calleth to the dry land `Earth,' and to the collection of the waters He hath called `Seas;' and God seeth that `it is' good."
1001011,1,1,11,"And God saith, `Let the earth yield tender grass, herb sowing seed, fruit-tree (whose seed `is' in itself) making fruit after its kind, on the earth:' and it is so."
1001012,1,1,12,"And the earth bringeth forth tender grass, herb sowing seed after its kind, and tree making fruit (whose seed `is' in itself) after its kind; and God seeth that `it is' good;"
1001013,1,1,13,"and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day third."
1001014,1,1,14,"And God saith, `Let luminaries be in the expanse of the heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night, then they have been for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,"
1001015,1,1,15,and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth:' and it is so.
1001016,1,1,16,"And God maketh the two great luminaries, the great luminary for the rule of the day, and the small luminary -- and the stars -- for the rule of the night;"
1001017,1,1,17,"and God giveth them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,"
1001018,1,1,18,"and to rule over day and over night, and to make a separation between the light and the darkness; and God seeth that `it is' good;"
1001019,1,1,19,"and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day fourth."
1001020,1,1,20,"And God saith, `Let the waters teem with the teeming living creature, and fowl let fly on the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.'"
1001021,1,1,21,"And God prepareth the great monsters, and every living creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with, after their kind, and every fowl with wing, after its kind, and God seeth that `it is' good."
1001022,1,1,22,"And God blesseth them, saying, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl let multiply in the earth:'"
1001023,1,1,23,"and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day fifth."
1001024,1,1,24,"And God saith, `Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind:' and it is so."
1001025,1,1,25,"And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, and God seeth that `it is' good."
1001026,1,1,26,"And God saith, `Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'"
1001027,1,1,27,"And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them."
1001028,1,1,28,"And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every living thing that is creeping upon the earth.'"
1001029,1,1,29,"And God saith, `Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which `is' upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which `is' the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for food;"
1001030,1,1,30,"and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which `is' breath of life, every green herb `is' for food:' and it is so."
1001031,1,1,31,"And God seeth all that He hath done, and lo, very good; and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day the sixth."
1002001,1,2,1,"And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their host;"
1002002,1,2,2,"and God completeth by the seventh day His work which He hath made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He hath made."
1002003,1,2,3,"And God blesseth the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in it He hath ceased from all His work which God had prepared for making."
1002004,1,2,4,"These `are' births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared, in the day of Jehovah God's making earth and heavens;"
1002005,1,2,5,"and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for Jehovah God hath not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,"
1002006,1,2,6,"and a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the whole face of the ground."
1002007,1,2,7,"And Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becometh a living creature."
1002008,1,2,8,"And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden, at the east, and He setteth there the man whom He hath formed;"
1002009,1,2,9,"and Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
1002010,1,2,10,"And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief `rivers';"
1002011,1,2,11,"the name of the one `is' Pison, it `is' that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold `is',"
1002012,1,2,12,"and the gold of that land `is' good, there `is' the bdolach and the shoham stone;"
1002013,1,2,13,"and the name of the second river `is' Gibon, it `is' that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;"
1002014,1,2,14,"and the name of the third river `is' Hiddekel, it `is' that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat."
1002015,1,2,15,"And Jehovah God taketh the man, and causeth him to rest in the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it."
1002016,1,2,16,"And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man, saying, `Of every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat;"
1002017,1,2,17,"and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it -- dying thou dost die.'"
1002018,1,2,18,"And Jehovah God saith, `Not good for the man to be alone, I do make to him an helper -- as his counterpart.'"
1002019,1,2,19,"And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the man, to see what he doth call it; and whatever the man calleth a living creature, that `is' its name."
1002020,1,2,20,"And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath not been found an helper -- as his counterpart."
1002021,1,2,21,"And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up flesh in its stead."
1002022,1,2,22,"And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man;"
1002023,1,2,23,"and the man saith, `This `is' the `proper' step! bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!' for this it is called Woman, for from a man hath this been taken;"
1002024,1,2,24,"therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh."
1002025,1,2,25,"And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves."
1003001,1,3,1,"And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman, `Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of the garden?'"
1003002,1,3,2,"And the woman saith unto the serpent, `Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we do eat,"
1003003,1,3,3,"and of the fruit of the tree which `is' in the midst of the garden God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest ye die.'"
1003004,1,3,4,"And the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,"
1003005,1,3,5,"for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it -- your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.'"
1003006,1,3,6,"And the woman seeth that the tree `is' good for food, and that it `is' pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make `one' wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat;"
1003007,1,3,7,"and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they `are' naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to themselves girdles."
1003008,1,3,8,"And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the trees of the garden."
1003009,1,3,9,"And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him, `Where `art' thou?'"
1003010,1,3,10,"and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'"
1003011,1,3,11,"And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou `art' naked? of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?'"
1003012,1,3,12,"and the man saith, `The woman whom Thou didst place with me -- she hath given to me of the tree -- and I do eat.'"
1003013,1,3,13,"And Jehovah God saith to the woman, `What `is' this thou hast done?' and the woman saith, `The serpent hath caused me to forget -- and I do eat.'"
1003014,1,3,14,"And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, `Because thou hast done this, cursed `art' thou above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust thou dost eat, all days of thy life;"
1003015,1,3,15,"and enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee -- the head, and thou dost bruise him -- the heel.'"
1003016,1,3,16,"Unto the woman He said, `Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, in sorrow dost thou bear children, and toward thy husband `is' thy desire, and he doth rule over thee.'"
1003017,1,3,17,"And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed `is' the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life,"
1003018,1,3,18,"and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou hast eaten the herb of the field;"
1003019,1,3,19,"by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for dust thou `art', and unto dust thou turnest back.'"
1003020,1,3,20,And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been mother of all living.
1003021,1,3,21,"And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats of skin, and doth clothe them."
1003022,1,3,22,"And Jehovah God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,' --"
1003023,1,3,23,Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;
1003024,1,3,24,"yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the tree of life."
1004001,1,4,1,"And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, `I have gotten a man by Jehovah;'"
1004002,1,4,2,"and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground."
1004003,1,4,3,And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;
1004004,1,4,4,"and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,"
1004005,1,4,5,"and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen."
1004006,1,4,6,"And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?"
1004007,1,4,7,"Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'"
1004008,1,4,8,"And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, ``Let us go into the field;'' and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him."
1004009,1,4,9,"And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Where `is' Abel thy brother?' and he saith, `I have not known; my brother's keeper -- I?'"
1004010,1,4,10,"And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;"
1004011,1,4,11,"and now, cursed `art' thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;"
1004012,1,4,12,"when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.'"
1004013,1,4,13,"And Cain saith unto Jehovah, `Greater is my punishment than to be borne;"
1004014,1,4,14,"lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every one finding me doth slay me.'"
1004015,1,4,15,"And Jehovah saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him."
1004016,1,4,16,"And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;"
1004017,1,4,17,"and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of the city, according to the name of his son -- Enoch."
1004018,1,4,18,And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.
1004019,1,4,19,"And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah."
1004020,1,4,20,"And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;"
1004021,1,4,21,"and the name of his brother `is' Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ."
1004022,1,4,22,"And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain `is' Naamah."
1004023,1,4,23,"And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear `to' my saying: For a man I have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;"
1004024,1,4,24,"For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.'"
1004025,1,4,25,"And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth, `for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had slain him."
1004026,1,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah."
1005001,1,5,1,"This `is' an account of the births of Adam: In the day of God's preparing man, in the likeness of God He hath made him;"
1005002,1,5,2,"a male and a female He hath prepared them, and He blesseth them, and calleth their name Man, in the day of their being prepared."
1005003,1,5,3,"And Adam liveth an hundred and thirty years, and begetteth `a son' in his likeness, according to his image, and calleth his name Seth."
1005004,1,5,4,"And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth are eight hundred years, and he begetteth sons and daughters."
1005005,1,5,5,"And all the days of Adam which he lived are nine hundred and thirty years, and he dieth."
1005006,1,5,6,"And Seth liveth an hundred and five years, and begetteth Enos."
1005007,1,5,7,"And Seth liveth after his begetting Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters."

1005009,1,5,9,"And Enos liveth ninety years, and begetteth Cainan."
1005010,1,5,10,"And Enos liveth after his begetting Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005011,1,5,11,"And all the days of Enos are nine hundred and five years, and he dieth."
1005012,1,5,12,"And Cainan liveth seventy years, and begetteth Mahalaleel."
1005013,1,5,13,"And Cainan liveth after his begetting Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005014,1,5,14,"And all the days of Cainan are nine hundred and ten years, and he dieth."
1005015,1,5,15,"And Mahalaleel liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Jared."
1005016,1,5,16,"And Mahalaleel liveth after his begetting Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005017,1,5,17,"And all the days of Mahalaleel are eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he dieth."
1005018,1,5,18,"And Jared liveth an hundred and sixty and two years, and begetteth Enoch."
1005019,1,5,19,"And Jared liveth after his begetting Enoch eight hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005020,1,5,20,"And all the days of Jared are nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he dieth."
1005021,1,5,21,"And Enoch liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Methuselah."
1005022,1,5,22,"And Enoch walketh habitually with God after his begetting Methuselah three hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005023,1,5,23,And all the days of Enoch are three hundred and sixty and five years.
1005024,1,5,24,"And Enoch walketh habitually with God, and he is not, for God hath taken him."
1005025,1,5,25,"And Methuselah liveth an hundred and eighty and seven years, and begetteth Lamech."
1005026,1,5,26,"And Methuselah liveth after his begetting Lamech seven hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005027,1,5,27,"And all the days of Methuselah are nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he dieth."
1005028,1,5,28,"And Lamech liveth an hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth a son,"
1005029,1,5,29,"and calleth his name Noah, saying, `This `one' doth comfort us concerning our work, and concerning the labour of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.'"
1005030,1,5,30,"And Lamech liveth after his begetting Noah five hundred and ninety and five years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1005031,1,5,31,"And all the days of Lamech are seven hundred and seventy and seven years, and he dieth."
1005032,1,5,32,"And Noah is a son of five hundred years, and Noah begetteth Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1006001,1,6,1,"And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,"
1006002,1,6,2,"and sons of God see the daughters of men that they `are' fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen."
1006003,1,6,3,"And Jehovah saith, `My Spirit doth not strive in man -- to the age; in their erring they `are' flesh:' and his days have been an hundred and twenty years."
1006004,1,6,4,"The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them -- they `are' the heroes, who, from of old, `are' the men of name."
1006005,1,6,5,"And Jehovah seeth that abundant `is' the wickedness of man in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil all the day;"
1006006,1,6,6,"and Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself -- unto His heart."
1006007,1,6,7,"And Jehovah saith, `I wipe away man whom I have prepared from off the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens, for I have repented that I have made them.'"
1006008,1,6,8,And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah.
1006009,1,6,9,These `are' births of Noah: Noah `is' a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked habitually.
1006010,1,6,10,"And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1006011,1,6,11,"And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled `with' violence."
1006012,1,6,12,"And God seeth the earth, and lo, it hath been corrupted, for all flesh hath corrupted its way on the earth."
1006013,1,6,13,"And God said to Noah, `An end of all flesh hath come before Me, for the earth hath been full of violence from their presence; and lo, I am destroying them with the earth."
1006014,1,6,14,"`Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; rooms dost thou make with the ark, and thou hast covered it within and without with cypress;"
1006015,1,6,15,"and this `is' that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits `is' the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;"
1006016,1,6,16,"a window dost thou make for the ark, and unto a cubit thou dost restrain it from above; and the opening of the ark thou dost put in its side, -- lower, second, and third `stories' dost thou make it."
1006017,1,6,17,"`And I, lo, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which `is' a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that `is' in the earth doth expire."
1006018,1,6,18,"`And I have established My covenant with thee, and thou hast come in unto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy son's wives with thee;"
1006019,1,6,19,"and of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every `sort' thou dost bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female are they."
1006020,1,6,20,"Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every `sort' they come in unto thee, to keep alive."
1006021,1,6,21,"`And thou, take to thyself of all food that is eaten; and thou hast gathered unto thyself, and it hath been to thee and to them for food.'"
1006022,1,6,22,And Noah doth according to all that God hath commanded him; so hath he done.
1007001,1,7,1,"And Jehovah saith to Noah, `Come in, thou and all thy house, unto the ark, for thee I have seen righteous before Me in this generation;"
1007002,1,7,2,"of all the clean beasts thou dost take to thee seven pairs, a male and its female; and of the beasts which are not clean two, a male and its female;"
1007003,1,7,3,"also, of fowl of the heavens seven pairs, a male and a female, to keep alive seed on the face of all the earth;"
1007004,1,7,4,"for after other seven days I am sending rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and have wiped away all the substance that I have made from off the face of the ground.'"
1007005,1,7,5,And Noah doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him:
1007006,1,7,6,"and Noah `is' a son of six hundred years, and the deluge of waters hath been upon the earth."
1007007,1,7,7,"And Noah goeth in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, unto the ark, from the presence of the waters of the deluge;"
1007008,1,7,8,"of the clean beasts and of the beasts that `are' not clean, and of the fowl, and of every thing that is creeping upon the ground,"
1007009,1,7,9,"two by two they have come in unto Noah, unto the ark, a male and a female, as God hath commanded Noah."
1007010,1,7,10,"And it cometh to pass, after the seventh of the days, that waters of the deluge have been on the earth."
1007011,1,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in this day have been broken up all fountains of the great deep, and the net-work of the heavens hath been opened,"
1007012,1,7,12,and the shower is on the earth forty days and forty nights.
1007013,1,7,13,"In this self-same day went in Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, unto the ark;"
1007014,1,7,14,"they, and every living creature after its kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird -- every wing."
1007015,1,7,15,"And they come in unto Noah, unto the ark, two by two of all the flesh in which `is' a living spirit;"
1007016,1,7,16,"and they that are coming in, male and female of all flesh, have come in as God hath commanded him, and Jehovah doth close `it' for him."
1007017,1,7,17,"And the deluge is forty days on the earth, and the waters multiply, and lift up the ark, and it is raised up from off the earth;"
1007018,1,7,18,"and the waters are mighty, and multiply exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark goeth on the face of the waters."
1007019,1,7,19,"And the waters have been very very mighty on the earth, and covered are all the high mountains which `are' under the whole heavens;"
1007020,1,7,20,"fifteen cubits upwards have the waters become mighty, and the mountains are covered;"
1007021,1,7,21,"and expire doth all flesh that is moving on the earth, among fowl, and among cattle, and among beasts, and among all the teeming things which are teeming on the earth, and all mankind;"
1007022,1,7,22,all in whose nostrils `is' breath of a living spirit -- of all that `is' in the dry land -- have died.
1007023,1,7,23,"And wiped away is all the substance that is on the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens; yea, they are wiped away from the earth, and only Noah is left, and those who `are' with him in the ark;"
1007024,1,7,24,and the waters are mighty on the earth a hundred and fifty days.
1008001,1,8,1,"And God remembereth Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle which `are' with him in the ark, and God causeth a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside,"
1008002,1,8,2,"and closed are the fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens, and restrained is the shower from the heavens."
1008003,1,8,3,"And turn back do the waters from off the earth, going on and returning; and the waters are lacking at the end of a hundred and fifty days."
1008004,1,8,4,"And the ark resteth, in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat;"
1008005,1,8,5,"and the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth `month', on the first of the month, appeared the heads of the mountains."
1008006,1,8,6,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah openeth the window of the ark which he made,"
1008007,1,8,7,"and he sendeth forth the raven, and it goeth out, going out and turning back till the drying of the waters from off the earth."
1008008,1,8,8,"And he sendeth forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground,"
1008009,1,8,9,"and the dove hath not found rest for the sole of her foot, and she turneth back unto him, unto the ark, for waters `are' on the face of all the earth, and he putteth out his hand, and taketh her, and bringeth her in unto him, unto the ark."
1008010,1,8,10,"And he stayeth yet other seven days, and addeth to send forth the dove from the ark;"
1008011,1,8,11,"and the dove cometh in unto him at even-time, and lo, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth; and Noah knoweth that the waters have been lightened from off the earth."
1008012,1,8,12,"And he stayeth yet other seven days, and sendeth forth the dove, and it added not to turn back unto him any more."
1008013,1,8,13,"And it cometh to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first `month', in the first of the month, the waters have been dried from off the earth; and Noah turneth aside the covering of the ark, and looketh, and lo, the face of the ground hath been dried."
1008014,1,8,14,"And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth hath become dry."
1008015,1,8,15,"And God speaketh unto Noah, saying, `Go out from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee;"
1008016,1,8,16,"every living thing that `is' with thee, of all flesh, among fowl, and among cattle, and among every creeping thing which is creeping on the earth, bring out with thee;"
1008017,1,8,17,"and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied on the earth.'"
1008018,1,8,18,"And Noah goeth out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him;"
1008019,1,8,19,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl; every creeping thing on the earth, after their families, have gone out from the ark."
1008020,1,8,20,"And Noah buildeth an altar to Jehovah, and taketh of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and causeth burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar;"
1008021,1,8,21,"and Jehovah smelleth the sweet fragrance, and Jehovah saith unto His heart, `I continue not to disesteem any more the ground because of man, though the imagination of the heart of man `is' evil from his youth; and I continue not to smite any more all living, as I have done;"
1008022,1,8,22,"during all days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, do not cease.'"
1009001,1,9,1,"And God blesseth Noah, and his sons, and saith to them, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;"
1009002,1,9,2,"and your fear and your dread is on every beast of the earth, and on every fowl of the heavens, on all that creepeth on the ground, and on all fishes of the sea -- into your hand they have been given."
1009003,1,9,3,"Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food; as the green herb I have given to you the whole;"
1009004,1,9,4,only flesh in its life -- its blood -- ye do not eat.
1009005,1,9,5,"`And only your blood for your lives do I require; from the hand of every living thing I require it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of every man's brother I require the life of man;"
1009006,1,9,6,"whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man is his blood shed: for in the image of God hath He made man."
1009007,1,9,7,"And ye, be fruitful and multiply, teem in the earth, and multiply in it.'"
1009008,1,9,8,"And God speaketh unto Noah, and unto his sons with him, saying,"
1009009,1,9,9,"`And I, lo, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,"
1009010,1,9,10,"and with every living creature which `is' with you, among fowl, among cattle, and among every beast of the earth with you, from all who are going out of the ark -- to every beast of the earth."
1009011,1,9,11,"And I have established My covenant with you, and all flesh is not any more cut off by waters of a deluge, and there is not any more a deluge to destroy the earth.'"
1009012,1,9,12,"And God saith, `This is a token of the covenant which I am giving between Me and you, and every living creature that `is' with you, to generations age-during;"
1009013,1,9,13,"My bow I have given in the cloud, and it hath been for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth;"
1009014,1,9,14,"and it hath come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow hath been seen in the cloud,"
1009015,1,9,15,"and I have remembered My covenant which is between Me and you, and every living creature among all flesh, and the waters become no more a deluge to destroy all flesh;"
1009016,1,9,16,"and the bow hath been in the cloud, and I have seen it -- to remember the covenant age-during between God and every living creature among all flesh which `is' on the earth.'"
1009017,1,9,17,"And God saith unto Noah, `This `is' a token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that `is' upon the earth.'"
1009018,1,9,18,"And the sons of Noah who are going out of the ark are Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is father of Canaan."
1009019,1,9,19,"These three `are' sons of Noah, and from these hath all the earth been overspread."
1009020,1,9,20,"And Noah remaineth a man of the ground, and planteth a vineyard,"
1009021,1,9,21,"and drinketh of the wine, and is drunken, and uncovereth himself in the midst of the tent."
1009022,1,9,22,"And Ham, father of Canaan, seeth the nakedness of his father, and declareth to his two brethren without."
1009023,1,9,23,"And Shem taketh -- Japheth also -- the garment, and they place on the shoulder of them both, and go backward, and cover the nakedness of their father; and their faces `are' backward, and their father's nakedness they have not seen."
1009024,1,9,24,"And Noah awaketh from his wine, and knoweth that which his young son hath done to him,"
1009025,1,9,25,"and saith: `Cursed `is' Canaan, Servant of servants he is to his brethren.'"
1009026,1,9,26,"And he saith: `Blessed of Jehovah my God `is' Shem, And Canaan is servant to him."
1009027,1,9,27,"God doth give beauty to Japheth, And he dwelleth in tents of Shem, And Canaan is servant to him.'"
1009028,1,9,28,And Noah liveth after the deluge three hundred and fifty years;
1009029,1,9,29,"and all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years, and he dieth."
1010001,1,10,1,"And these `are' births of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and born to them are sons after the deluge."
1010002,1,10,2,"`Sons of Japheth `are' Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
1010003,1,10,3,"And sons of Gomer `are' Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
1010004,1,10,4,"And sons of Javan `are' Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
1010005,1,10,5,"By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations."
1010006,1,10,6,"And sons of Ham `are' Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
1010007,1,10,7,"And sons of Cush `are' Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah `are' Sheba and Dedan."
1010008,1,10,8,And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;
1010009,1,10,9,"he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, `As Nimrod the hero `in' hunting before Jehovah.'"
1010010,1,10,10,"And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;"
1010011,1,10,11,"from that land he hath gone out to Asshur, and buildeth Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,"
1010012,1,10,12,"and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it `is' the great city."
1010013,1,10,13,"And Mitzraim hath begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,"
1010014,1,10,14,"and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, (whence have come out Philistim,) and the Caphtorim."
1010015,1,10,15,"And Canaan hath begotten Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
1010016,1,10,16,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,"
1010017,1,10,17,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
1010018,1,10,18,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered."
1010019,1,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, `in' thy coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; `in' thy coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha."
1010020,1,10,20,"These `are' sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
1010021,1,10,21,"As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he hath also begotten:"
1010022,1,10,22,"Sons of Shem `are' Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
1010023,1,10,23,"And sons of Aram `are' Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
1010024,1,10,24,"And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah, and Salah hath begotten Eber."
1010025,1,10,25,"And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one `is' Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided,) and his brother's name `is' Joktan."
1010026,1,10,26,"And Joktan hath begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
1010027,1,10,27,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
1010028,1,10,28,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
1010029,1,10,29,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these `are' sons of Joktan;"
1010030,1,10,30,"and their dwelling is from Mesha, `in' thy coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east."
1010031,1,10,31,"These `are' sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations."
1010032,1,10,32,"These `are' families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge."
1011001,1,11,1,"And the whole earth is of one pronunciation, and of the same words,"
1011002,1,11,2,"and it cometh to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar, and dwell there;"
1011003,1,11,3,"and they say each one to his neighbour, `Give help, let us make bricks, and burn `them' thoroughly:' and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen hath been to them for mortar."
1011004,1,11,4,"And they say, `Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower, and its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.'"
1011005,1,11,5,And Jehovah cometh down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;
1011006,1,11,6,"and Jehovah saith, `Lo, the people `is' one, and one pronunciation `is' to them all, and this it hath dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do."
1011007,1,11,7,"Give help, let us go down, and mingle there their pronunciation, so that a man doth not understand the pronunciation of his companion.'"
1011008,1,11,8,"And Jehovah doth scatter them from thence over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;"
1011009,1,11,9,"therefore hath `one' called its name Babel, for there hath Jehovah mingled the pronunciation of all the earth, and from thence hath Jehovah scattered them over the face of all the earth."
1011010,1,11,10,"These `are' births of Shem: Shem `is' a son of an hundred years, and begetteth Arphaxad two years after the deluge."
1011011,1,11,11,"And Shem liveth after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011012,1,11,12,"And Arphaxad hath lived five and thirty years, and begetteth Salah."
1011013,1,11,13,"And Arphaxad liveth after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011014,1,11,14,"And Salah hath lived thirty years, and begetteth Eber."
1011015,1,11,15,"And Salah liveth after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011016,1,11,16,"And Eber liveth four and thirty years, and begetteth Peleg."
1011017,1,11,17,"And Eber liveth after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011018,1,11,18,"And Peleg liveth thirty years, and begetteth Reu."
1011019,1,11,19,"And Peleg liveth after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011020,1,11,20,"And Reu liveth two and thirty years, and begetteth Serug."
1011021,1,11,21,"And Reu liveth after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011022,1,11,22,"And Serug liveth thirty years, and begetteth Nahor."
1011023,1,11,23,"And Serug liveth after his begetting Nahor two hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011024,1,11,24,"And Nahor liveth nine and twenty years, and begetteth Terah."
1011025,1,11,25,"And Nahor liveth after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters."
1011026,1,11,26,"And Terah liveth seventy years, and begetteth Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
1011027,1,11,27,"And these `are' births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran hath begotten Lot;"
1011028,1,11,28,"and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees."
1011029,1,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife `is' Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife `is' Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah."
1011030,1,11,30,And Sarai is barren -- she hath no child.
1011031,1,11,31,"And Terah taketh Abram his son, and Lot, son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come unto Charan, and dwell there."
1011032,1,11,32,"And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dieth in Charan."
1012001,1,12,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Abram, `Go for thyself, from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from the house of thy father, unto the land which I shew thee."
1012002,1,12,2,"And I make thee become a great nation, and bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing."
1012003,1,12,3,"And I bless those blessing thee, and him who is disesteeming thee I curse, and blessed in thee have been all families of the ground.'"
1012004,1,12,4,"And Abram goeth on, as Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and Lot goeth with him, and Abram `is' a son of five and seventy years in his going out from Charan."
1012005,1,12,5,"And Abram taketh Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they have gained, and the persons that they have obtained in Charan; and they go out to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come in to the land of Canaan."
1012006,1,12,6,"And Abram passeth over into the land, unto the place Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh; and the Canaanite `is' then in the land."
1012007,1,12,7,"And Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith, `To thy seed I give this land;' and he buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, who hath appeared unto him."
1012008,1,12,8,"And he removeth from thence towards a mountain at the east of Beth-El, and stretcheth out the tent (Beth-El at the west, and Hai at the east), and he buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and preacheth in the name of Jehovah."
1012009,1,12,9,"And Abram journeyeth, going on and journeying towards the south."
1012010,1,12,10,"And there is a famine in the land, and Abram goeth down towards Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine `is' grievous in the land;"
1012011,1,12,11,"and it cometh to pass as he hath drawn near to enter Egypt, that he saith unto Sarai his wife, `Lo, I pray thee, I have known that thou `art' a woman of beautiful appearance;"
1012012,1,12,12,"and it hath come to pass that the Egyptians see thee, and they have said, `This `is' his wife,' and they have slain me, and thee they keep alive:"
1012013,1,12,13,"say, I pray thee, thou `art' my sister, so that it is well with me because of thee, and my soul hath lived for thy sake.'"
1012014,1,12,14,"And it cometh to pass, at the entering of Abram into Egypt, that the Egyptians see the woman that she `is' exceeding fair;"
1012015,1,12,15,"and princes of Pharaoh see her, and praise her unto Pharaoh, and the woman is taken `to' Pharaoh's house;"
1012016,1,12,16,"and to Abram he hath done good because of her, and he hath sheep and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and handmaids, and she-asses, and camels."
1012017,1,12,17,"And Jehovah plagueth Pharaoh and his house -- great plagues -- for the matter of Sarai, Abram's wife."
1012018,1,12,18,"And Pharaoh calleth for Abram, and saith, `What `is' this thou hast done to me? why hast thou not declared to me that she `is' thy wife?"
1012019,1,12,19,"Why hast thou said, She `is' my sister, and I take her to myself for a wife? and now, lo, thy wife, take and go.'"
1012020,1,12,20,"And Pharaoh chargeth men concerning him, and they send him away, and his wife, an all that he hath."
1013001,1,13,1,"And Abram goeth up from Egypt (he and his wife, and all that he hath, and Lot with him) towards the south;"
1013002,1,13,2,"and Abram `is' exceedingly wealthy in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
1013003,1,13,3,"And he goeth on his journeyings from the south, even unto Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the commencement, between Bethel and Hai --"
1013004,1,13,4,"unto the place of the altar which he made there at the first, and there doth Abram preach in the name of Jehovah."
1013005,1,13,5,"And also to Lot, who is going with Abram, there hath been sheep and oxen and tents;"
1013006,1,13,6,"and the land hath not suffered them to dwell together, for their substance hath been much, and they have not been able to dwell together;"
1013007,1,13,7,and there is a strife between those feeding Abram's cattle and those feeding Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite `are' then dwelling in the land.
1013008,1,13,8,"And Abram saith unto Lot, `Let there not, I pray thee, be strife between me and thee, and between my shepherds and thy shepherds, for we `are' men -- brethren."
1013009,1,13,9,"Is not all the land before thee? be parted, I pray thee, from me; if to the left, then I to the right; and if to the right, then I to the left.'"
1013010,1,13,10,"And Lot lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the whole circuit of the Jordan that it `is' all a watered country (before Jehovah's destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, as Jehovah's garden, as the land of Egypt,) in thy coming toward Zoar,"
1013011,1,13,11,"and Lot chooseth for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeyeth from the east, and they are parted -- a man from his companion;"
1013012,1,13,12,"Abram hath dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot hath dwelt in the cities of the circuit, and tenteth unto Sodom;"
1013013,1,13,13,"and the men of Sodom `are' evil, and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly."
1013014,1,13,14,"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after Lot's being parted from him, `Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and look from the place where thou `art', northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;"
1013015,1,13,15,"for the whole of the land which thou are seeing, to thee I give it, and to thy seed -- to the age."
1013016,1,13,16,"And I have set thy seed as dust of the earth, so that, if one is able to number the dust of the earth, even thy seed is numbered;"
1013017,1,13,17,"rise, go up and down through the land, to its length, and to its breadth, for to thee I give it.'"
1013018,1,13,18,"And Abram tenteth, and cometh, and dwelleth among the oaks of Mamre, which `are' in Hebron, and buildeth there an altar to Jehovah."
1014001,1,14,1,"And it cometh to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim,"
1014002,1,14,2,"they have made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which `is' Zoar."
1014003,1,14,3,"All these have been joined together unto the valley of Siddim, which `is' the Salt Sea;"
1014004,1,14,4,"twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they rebelled."
1014005,1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings who `are' with him, and they smite the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
1014006,1,14,6,"and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-Paran, which `is' by the wilderness;"
1014007,1,14,7,"and they turn back and come in unto En-Mishpat, which `is' Kadesh, and smite the whole field of the Amalekite, and also the Amorite who is dwelling in Hazezon-Tamar."
1014008,1,14,8,"And the king of Sodom goeth out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which `is' Zoar; and they set the battle in array with them in the valley of Siddim,"
1014009,1,14,9,"with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with the five."
1014010,1,14,10,"And the valley of Siddim `is' full of bitumen-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee, and fall there, and those left have fled to the mountain."
1014011,1,14,11,"And they take the whole substance of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the whole of their food, and go away;"
1014012,1,14,12,"and they take Lot, Abram's brother's son (seeing he is dwelling in Sodom), and his substance, and go away."
1014013,1,14,13,"And one who is escaping cometh and declareth to Abram the Hebrew, and he is dwelling among the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and they `are' Abram's allies."
1014014,1,14,14,"And Abram heareth that his brother hath been taken captive, and he draweth out his trained domestics, three hundred and eighteen, and pursueth unto Dan."
1014015,1,14,15,"And he divideth himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smiteth them, and pursueth them unto Hobah, which `is' at the left of Damascus;"
1014016,1,14,16,"and he bringeth back the whole of the substance, and also Lot his brother and his substance hath he brought back, and also the women and the people."
1014017,1,14,17,"And the king of Sodom goeth out to meet him (after his turning back from the smiting of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who `are' with him), unto the valley of Shaveh, which `is' the king's valley."
1014018,1,14,18,"And Melchizedek king of Salem hath brought out bread and wine, and he `is' priest of God Most High;"
1014019,1,14,19,"and he blesseth him, and saith, `Blessed `is' Abram to God Most High, possessing heaven and earth;"
1014020,1,14,20,"and blessed `is' God Most High, who hath delivered thine adversaries into thy hand;' and he giveth to him a tenth of all."
1014021,1,14,21,"And the king of Sodom saith unto Abram, `Give to me the persons, and the substance take to thyself,'"
1014022,1,14,22,"and Abram saith unto the king of Sodom, `I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessing heaven and earth --"
1014023,1,14,23,"from a thread even unto a shoe-latchet I take not of anything which thou hast, that thou say not, I -- I have made Abram rich;"
1014024,1,14,24,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who have gone with me -- Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre -- they take their portion.'"
1015001,1,15,1,"After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, `Fear not, Abram, I `am' a shield to thee, thy reward `is' exceeding great.'"
1015002,1,15,2,"And Abram saith, `Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'"
1015003,1,15,3,"And Abram saith, `Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.'"
1015004,1,15,4,"And lo, the word of Jehovah `is' unto him, saying, `This `one' doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;'"
1015005,1,15,5,"and He bringeth him out without, and saith, `Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;' and He saith to him, `Thus is thy seed.'"
1015006,1,15,6,"And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him -- righteousness."
1015007,1,15,7,"And He saith unto him, `I `am' Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;'"
1015008,1,15,8,"and he saith, `Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?'"
1015009,1,15,9,"And He saith unto him, `Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'"
1015010,1,15,10,"and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;"
1015011,1,15,11,"and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back."
1015012,1,15,12,"And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;"
1015013,1,15,13,"and He saith to Abram, `knowing -- know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,"
1015014,1,15,14,"and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;"
1015015,1,15,15,and thou -- thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;
1015016,1,15,16,"and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'"
1015017,1,15,17,"And it cometh to pass -- the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been -- and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces."
1015018,1,15,18,"In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, `To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,"
1015019,1,15,19,"with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,"
1015020,1,15,20,"and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,"
1015021,1,15,21,"and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'"
1016001,1,16,1,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, hath not borne to him, and she hath an handmaid, an Egyptian, and her name `is' Hagar;"
1016002,1,16,2,"and Sarai saith unto Abram, `Lo, I pray thee, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing, go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; perhaps I am built up from her;' and Abram hearkeneth to the voice of Sarai."
1016003,1,16,3,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, taketh Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, at the end of the tenth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and giveth her to Abram her husband, to him for a wife,"
1016004,1,16,4,"and he goeth in unto Hagar, and she conceiveth, and she seeth that she hath conceived, and her mistress is lightly esteemed in her eyes."
1016005,1,16,5,"And Sarai saith unto Abram, `My violence `is' for thee; I -- I have given mine handmaid into thy bosom, and she seeth that she hath conceived, and I am lightly esteemed in her eyes; Jehovah doth judge between me and thee.'"
1016006,1,16,6,"And Abram saith unto Sarai, `Lo, thine handmaid `is' in thine hand, do to her that which is good in thine eyes;' and Sarai afflicted her, and she fleeth from her presence."
1016007,1,16,7,"And a messenger of Jehovah findeth her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way `to' Shur,"
1016008,1,16,8,"and he saith, `Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence hast thou come, and whither dost thou go?' and she saith, `From the presence of Sarai, my mistress, I am fleeing.'"
1016009,1,16,9,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Turn back unto thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hands;'"
1016010,1,16,10,"and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Multiplying I multiply thy seed, and it is not numbered from multitude;'"
1016011,1,16,11,"and the messenger of Jehovah saith to her, `Behold thou `art' conceiving, and bearing a son, and hast called his name Ishmael, for Jehovah hath hearkened unto thine affliction;"
1016012,1,16,12,"and he is a wild-ass man, his hand against every one, and every one's hand against him -- and before the face of all his brethren he dwelleth.'"
1016013,1,16,13,"And she calleth the name of Jehovah who is speaking unto her, `Thou `art', O God, my beholder;' for she said, `Even here have I looked behind my beholder?'"
1016014,1,16,14,"therefore hath one called the well, `The well of the Living One, my beholder;' lo, between Kadesh and Bered."
1016015,1,16,15,"And Hagar beareth to Abram a son; and Abram calleth the name of his son, whom Hagar hath borne, Ishmael;"
1016016,1,16,16,and Abram `is' a son of eighty and six years in Hagar's bearing Ishmael to Abram.
1017001,1,17,1,"And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years, and Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith unto him, `I `am' God Almighty, walk habitually before Me, and be thou perfect;"
1017002,1,17,2,"and I give My covenant between Me and thee, and multiply thee very exceedingly.'"
1017003,1,17,3,"And Abram falleth upon his face, and God speaketh with him, saying,"
1017004,1,17,4,"`I -- lo, My covenant `is' with thee, and thou hast become father of a multitude of nations;"
1017005,1,17,5,"and thy name is no more called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made thee;"
1017006,1,17,6,"and I have made thee exceeding fruitful, and made thee become nations, and kings go out from thee."
1017007,1,17,7,"`And I have established My covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for a covenant age-during, to become God to thee, and to thy seed after thee;"
1017008,1,17,8,"and I have given to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a possession age-during, and I have become their God.'"
1017009,1,17,9,"And God saith unto Abraham, `And thou dost keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, to their generations;"
1017010,1,17,10,"this `is' My covenant which ye keep between Me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every male of you `is' to be circumcised;"
1017011,1,17,11,"and ye have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it hath become a token of a covenant between Me and you."
1017012,1,17,12,"`And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of thy seed;"
1017013,1,17,13,"he is certainly circumcised who `is' born in thine house, or bought with thy money; and My covenant hath become in your flesh a covenant age-during;"
1017014,1,17,14,"and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, even that person hath been cut off from his people; My covenant he hath broken.'"
1017015,1,17,15,"And God saith unto Abraham, `Sarai thy wife -- thou dost not call her name Sarai, for Sarah `is' her name;"
1017016,1,17,16,"and I have blessed her, and have also given to thee a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she hath become nations -- kings of peoples are from her.'"
1017017,1,17,17,"And Abraham falleth upon his face, and laugheth, and saith in his heart, `To the son of an hundred years is one born? or doth Sarah -- daughter of ninety years -- bear?'"
1017018,1,17,18,"And Abraham saith unto God, `O that Ishmael may live before Thee;'"
1017019,1,17,19,"and God saith, `Sarah thy wife is certainly bearing a son to thee, and thou hast called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a covenant age-during, to his seed after him."
1017020,1,17,20,"As to Ishmael, I have heard thee; lo, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes doth he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;"
1017021,1,17,21,"and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah doth bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year;'"
1017022,1,17,22,"and He finisheth speaking with him, and God goeth up from Abraham."
1017023,1,17,23,"And Abraham taketh Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money -- every male among the men of Abraham's house -- and circumciseth the flesh of their foreskin, in this self-same day, as God hath spoken with him."
1017024,1,17,24,And Abraham `is' a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
1017025,1,17,25,and Ishmael his son `is' a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
1017026,1,17,26,"in this self-same day hath Abraham been circumcised, and Ishmael his son;"
1017027,1,17,27,"and all the men of his house -- born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger -- have been circumcised with him."
1018001,1,18,1,"And Jehovah appeareth unto him among the oaks of Mamre, and he is sitting at the opening of the tent, about the heat of the day;"
1018002,1,18,2,"and he lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, three men standing by him, and he seeth, and runneth to meet them from the opening of the tent, and boweth himself towards the earth,"
1018003,1,18,3,"And he saith, `My Lord, if, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, do not, I pray thee, pass on from thy servant;"
1018004,1,18,4,"let, I pray thee, a little water be accepted, and wash your feet, and recline under the tree;"
1018005,1,18,5,"and I bring a piece of bread, and support ye your heart; afterwards pass on, for therefore have ye passed over unto your servant;' and they say, `So mayest thou do as thou has spoken.'"
1018006,1,18,6,"And Abraham hasteth towards the tent, unto Sarah, and saith, `Hasten three measures of flour-meal, knead, and make cakes;'"
1018007,1,18,7,"and Abraham ran unto the herd, and taketh a son of the herd, tender and good, and giveth unto the young man, and he hasteth to prepare it;"
1018008,1,18,8,"and he taketh butter and milk, and the son of the herd which he hath prepared, and setteth before them; and he is standing by them under the tree, and they do eat."
1018009,1,18,9,"And they say unto him, `Where `is' Sarah thy wife?' and he saith, `Lo -- in the tent;'"
1018010,1,18,10,"and he saith, `returning I return unto thee, about the time of life, and lo, to Sarah thy wife a son.'"
1018011,1,18,11,"And Sarah is hearkening at the opening of the tent, which is behind him;"
1018012,1,18,12,"and Abraham and Sarah `are' aged, entering into days -- the way of women hath ceased to be to Sarah;"
1018013,1,18,13,"and Sarah laugheth in her heart, saying, `After I have waxed old I have had pleasure! -- my lord also `is' old!'"
1018014,1,18,14,"And Jehovah saith unto Abraham, `Why `is' this? Sarah hath laughed, saying, Is it true really -- I bear -- and I am aged? Is any thing too wonderful for Jehovah? at the appointed time I return unto thee, about the time of life, and Sarah hath a son.'"
1018015,1,18,15,"And Sarah denieth, saying, `I did not laugh;' for she hath been afraid; and He saith, `Nay, but thou didst laugh.'"
1018016,1,18,16,"And the men rise from thence, and look on the face of Sodom, and Abraham is going with them to send them away;"
1018017,1,18,17,"and Jehovah said, `Am I concealing from Abraham that which I am doing,"
1018018,1,18,18,"and Abraham certainly becometh a nation great and mighty, and blessed in him have been all nations of the earth?"
1018019,1,18,19,"for I have known him, that he commandeth his children, and his house after him (and they have kept the way of Jehovah), to do righteousness and judgment, that Jehovah may bring on Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him.'"
1018020,1,18,20,"And Jehovah saith, `The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah -- because great; and their sin -- because exceeding grievous:"
1018021,1,18,21,"I go down now, and see whether according to its cry which is coming unto Me they have done completely -- and if not -- I know;'"
1018022,1,18,22,"and the men turn from thence, and go towards Sodom; and Abraham is yet standing before Jehovah."
1018023,1,18,23,"And Abraham draweth nigh and saith, `Dost Thou also consume righteous with wicked?"
1018024,1,18,24,"peradventure there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city; dost Thou also consume, and not bear with the place for the sake of the fifty -- the righteous who `are' in its midst?"
1018025,1,18,25,"Far be it from Thee to do according to this thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked; that it hath been -- as the righteous so the wicked -- far be it from Thee; doth the Judge of all the earth not do justice?'"
1018026,1,18,26,"And Jehovah saith, `If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city, then have I borne with all the place for their sake.'"
1018027,1,18,27,"And Abraham answereth and saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have willed to speak unto the Lord, and I -- dust and ashes;"
1018028,1,18,28,"peradventure there are lacking five of the fifty righteous -- dost Thou destroy for five the whole of the city?' and He saith, `I destroy `it' not, if I find there forty and five.'"
1018029,1,18,29,"And he addeth again to speak unto Him and saith, `Peradventure there are found there forty?' and He saith, `I do `it' not, because of the forty.'"
1018030,1,18,30,"And he saith, `Let it not be, I Pray thee, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak: peradventure there are found there thirty?' and He saith, `I do `it' not, if I find there thirty.'"
1018031,1,18,31,"And he saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have willed to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there are found there twenty?' and He saith, `I do not destroy `it', because of the twenty.'"
1018032,1,18,32,"And he saith, `Let it not be, I pray Thee, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak only this time: peradventure there are found there ten?' and He saith, `I do not destroy `it', because of the ten.'"
1018033,1,18,33,"And Jehovah goeth on, when He hath finished speaking unto Abraham, and Abraham hath turned back to his place."
1019001,1,19,1,"And two of the messengers come towards Sodom at even, and Lot is sitting at the gate of Sodom, and Lot seeth, and riseth to meet them, and boweth himself -- face to the earth,"
1019002,1,19,2,"and he saith, `Lo, I pray you, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, unto the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your feet -- then ye have risen early and gone on your way;' and they say, `Nay, but in the broad place we do lodge.'"
1019003,1,19,3,"And he presseth on them greatly, and they turn aside unto him, and come in unto his house; and he maketh for them a banquet, and hath baked unleavened things; and they do eat."
1019004,1,19,4,"Before they lie down, the men of the city -- men of Sodom -- have come round about against the house, from young even unto aged, all the people from the extremity;"
1019005,1,19,5,"and they call unto Lot and say to him, `Where `are' the men who have come in unto thee to-night? bring them out unto us, and we know them.'"
1019006,1,19,6,"And Lot goeth out unto them, to the opening, and the door hath shut behind him,"
1019007,1,19,7,"and saith, `Do not, I pray you, my brethren, do evil;"
1019008,1,19,8,"lo, I pray you, I have two daughters, who have not known any one; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do to them as `is' good in your eyes; only to these men do not anything, for therefore have they come in within the shadow of my roof.'"
1019009,1,19,9,"And they say, `Come nigh hither;' they say also, `This one hath come in to sojourn, and he certainly judgeth! now, we do evil to thee more than `to' them;' and they press against the man, against Lot greatly, and come nigh to break the door."
1019010,1,19,10,"And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot unto them, into the house, and have shut the door;"
1019011,1,19,11,"and the men who `are' at the opening of the house they have smitten with blindness, from small even unto great, and they weary themselves to find the opening."
1019012,1,19,12,"And the men say unto Lot, `Whom hast thou here still? son-in-law, thy sons also, and thy daughters, and all whom thou hast in the city, bring out from this place;"
1019013,1,19,13,"for we are destroying this place, for their cry hath been great `before' the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth send us to destroy it.'"
1019014,1,19,14,"And Lot goeth out, and speaketh unto his sons-in-law, those taking his daughters, and saith, `Rise, go out from this place, for Jehovah is destroying the city;' and he is as `one' mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law."
1019015,1,19,15,"And when the dawn hath ascended, then the messengers press upon Lot, saying, `Rise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are found present, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.'"
1019016,1,19,16,"And he lingereth, and the men lay hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, through the mercy of Jehovah unto him, and they bring him out, and cause him to rest without the city."
1019017,1,19,17,"And it cometh to pass when he hath brought them out without, that he saith, `Escape for thy life; look not expectingly behind thee, nor stand thou in all the circuit; to the mountain escape, lest thou be consumed.'"
1019018,1,19,18,"And Lot saith unto them, `Not `so', I pray thee, my lord;"
1019019,1,19,19,"lo, I pray thee, thy servant hath found grace in thine eyes, and thou dost make great thy kindness which thou hast done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to the mountain, lest the evil cleave `to' me, and I have died;"
1019020,1,19,20,"lo, I pray thee, this city `is' near to flee thither, and it `is' little; let me escape, I pray thee, thither, (is it not little?) and my soul doth live.'"
1019021,1,19,21,"And he saith unto him, `Lo, I have accepted thy face also for this thing, without overthrowing the city `for' which thou hast spoken;"
1019022,1,19,22,"haste, escape thither, for I am not able to do anything till thine entering thither;' therefore hath he calleth the name of the city Zoar."
1019023,1,19,23,"The sun hath gone out on the earth, and Lot hath entered into Zoar,"
1019024,1,19,24,"and Jehovah hath rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens;"
1019025,1,19,25,"and He overthroweth these cities, and all the circuit, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting up from the ground."
1019026,1,19,26,"And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him, and she is -- a pillar of salt!"
1019027,1,19,27,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, unto the place where he hath stood `before' the face of Jehovah;"
1019028,1,19,28,"and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on all the face of the land of the circuit, and seeth, and lo, the smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace."
1019029,1,19,29,"And it cometh to pass, in God's destroying the cities of the circuit, that God remembereth Abraham, and sendeth Lot out of the midst of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities in which Lot dwelt."
1019030,1,19,30,"And Lot goeth up out of Zoar, and dwelleth in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he hath been afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwelleth in a cave, he and his two daughters."
1019031,1,19,31,"And the first-born saith unto the younger, `Our father `is' old, and a man there is not in the earth to come in unto us, as `is' the way of all the earth;"
1019032,1,19,32,"come, we cause our father to drink wine, and lie with him, and preserve from our father -- a seed.'"
1019033,1,19,33,"And they cause their father to drink wine on that night; and the first-born goeth in, and lieth with her father, and he hath not known in her lying down, or in her rising up."
1019034,1,19,34,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the first-born saith unto the younger, `Lo, I have lain yesterday-night with my father: we cause him to drink wine also to-night, and go thou in, lie with him, and we preserve from our father -- a seed.'"
1019035,1,19,35,"And they cause their father to drink wine on that night also, and the younger riseth and lieth with him, and he hath not known in her lying down, or in her rising up."
1019036,1,19,36,"And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father,"
1019037,1,19,37,"and the first-born beareth a son, and calleth his name Moab; he `is' father of Moab unto this day;"
1019038,1,19,38,"as to the younger, she also hath born a son, and calleth his name Ben-Ammi: he `is' father of the Beni-Ammon unto this day."
1020001,1,20,1,"And Abraham journeyeth from thence toward the land of the south, and dwelleth between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourneth in Gerar;"
1020002,1,20,2,"and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife, `She is my sister;' and Abimelech king of Gerar sendeth and taketh Sarah."
1020003,1,20,3,"And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Lo, thou `art' a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken -- and she married to a husband.'"
1020004,1,20,4,"And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her, and he saith, `Lord, also a righteous nation dost thou slay?"
1020005,1,20,5,"hath not he himself said to me, She `is' my sister! and she, even she herself, said, He `is' my brother; in the integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have done this.'"
1020006,1,20,6,"And God saith unto him in the dream, `Yea, I -- I have known that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I withhold thee, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore I have not suffered thee to come against her;"
1020007,1,20,7,"and now send back the man's wife, for he `is' inspired, and he doth pray for thee, and live thou; and if thou do not send back, know that dying thou dost die, thou, and all that thou hast.'"
1020008,1,20,8,"And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and calleth for all his servants, and speaketh all these words in their ears; and the men fear exceedingly;"
1020009,1,20,9,"and Abimelech calleth for Abraham, and saith to him, `What hast thou done to us? and what have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin? works which are not done thou hast done with me.'"
1020010,1,20,10,"Abimelech also saith unto Abraham, `What hast thou seen that thou hast done this thing?'"
1020011,1,20,11,"And Abraham saith, `Because I said, `Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake of my wife;"
1020012,1,20,12,"and also, truly she is my sister, daughter of my father, only not daughter of my mother, and she becometh my wife;"
1020013,1,20,13,"and it cometh to pass, when God hath caused me to wander from my father's house, that I say to her, This `is' thy kindness which thou dost with me: at every place whither we come, say of me, He `is' my brother.'"
1020014,1,20,14,"And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and giveth to Abraham, and sendeth back to him Sarah his wife;"
1020015,1,20,15,"and Abimelech saith, `Lo, my land `is' before thee, where it is good in thine eyes, dwell;'"
1020016,1,20,16,"and to Sarah he hath said, `Lo, I have given a thousand silverlings to thy brother; lo, it is to thee a covering of eyes, to all who are with thee;' and by all this she is reasoned with."
1020017,1,20,17,"And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:"
1020018,1,20,18,"for Jehovah restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
1021001,1,21,1,"And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;"
1021002,1,21,2,"and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with him;"
1021003,1,21,3,"and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah hath born to him -- Isaac;"
1021004,1,21,4,"and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, `being' a son of eight days, as God hath commanded him."
1021005,1,21,5,"And Abraham `is' a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,"
1021006,1,21,6,"and Sarah saith, `God hath made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'"
1021007,1,21,7,"She saith also, `Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'"
1021008,1,21,8,"And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;"
1021009,1,21,9,"and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she hath borne to Abraham, mocking,"
1021010,1,21,10,"and she saith to Abraham, `Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid hath no possession with my son -- with Isaac.'"
1021011,1,21,11,"And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;"
1021012,1,21,12,"and God saith unto Abraham, `Let it not be wrong in thine eyes because of the youth, and because of thy handmaid: all that Sarah saith unto thee -- hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to thee."
1021013,1,21,13,"As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he `is' thy seed.'"
1021014,1,21,14,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and taketh bread, and a bottle of water, and giveth unto Hagar (placing `it' on her shoulder), also the lad, and sendeth her out; and she goeth on, and goeth astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;"
1021015,1,21,15,"and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs."
1021016,1,21,16,"And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, `Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth."
1021017,1,21,17,"And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her, `What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he `is';"
1021018,1,21,18,"rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy hand, for for a great nation I set him.'"
1021019,1,21,19,"And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water, and she goeth and filleth the bottle `with' water, and causeth the youth to drink;"
1021020,1,21,20,"and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;"
1021021,1,21,21,"and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother taketh for him a wife from the land of Egypt."
1021022,1,21,22,"And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh -- Phichol also, head of his host -- unto Abraham, saying, `God `is' with thee in all that thou art doing;"
1021023,1,21,23,"and now, swear to me by God here: thou dost not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with thee thou dost with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.'"
1021024,1,21,24,"And Abraham saith, `I -- I do swear.'"
1021025,1,21,25,"And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,"
1021026,1,21,26,"and Abimelech saith, `I have not known who hath done this thing, and even thou didst not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'"
1021027,1,21,27,"And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen, and giveth to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;"
1021028,1,21,28,and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.
1021029,1,21,29,"And Abimelech saith unto Abraham, `What `are' they -- these seven lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'"
1021030,1,21,30,"And he saith, `For -- the seven lambs thou dost accept from my hand, so that it becometh a witness for me that I have digged this well;'"
1021031,1,21,31,"therefore hath he called that place `Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn."
1021032,1,21,32,"And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth -- Phichol also, head of his host -- and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;"
1021033,1,21,33,"and `Abraham' planteth a tamarask in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Jehovah, God age-during;"
1021034,1,21,34,and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.
1022001,1,22,1,"And it cometh to pass after these things that God hath tried Abraham, and saith unto him, `Abraham;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
1022002,1,22,2,"And He saith, `Take, I pray thee, thy son, thine only one, whom thou hast loved, even Isaac, and go for thyself unto the land of Moriah, and cause him to ascend there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I speak unto thee.'"
1022003,1,22,3,"And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and taketh two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and he cleaveth the wood of the burnt-offering, and riseth and goeth unto the place of which God hath spoken to him."
1022004,1,22,4,"On the third day -- Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the place from afar;"
1022005,1,22,5,"and Abraham saith unto his young men, `Remain by yourselves here with the ass, and I and the youth go yonder and worship, and turn back unto you.'"
1022006,1,22,6,"And Abraham taketh the wood of the burnt-offering, and placeth on Isaac his son, and he taketh in his hand the fire, and the knife; and they go on both of them together."
1022007,1,22,7,"And Isaac speaketh unto Abraham his father, and saith, `My father,' and he saith, `Here `am' I, my son.' And he saith, `Lo, the fire and the wood, and where the lamb for a burnt-offering?'"
1022008,1,22,8,"and Abraham saith, `God doth provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son;' and they go on both of them together."
1022009,1,22,9,"And they come in unto the place of which God hath spoken to him, and there Abraham buildeth the altar, and arrangeth the wood, and bindeth Isaac his son, and placeth him upon the altar above the wood;"
1022010,1,22,10,"and Abraham putteth forth his hand, and taketh the knife -- to slaughter his son."
1022011,1,22,11,"And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto him from the heavens, and saith, `Abraham, Abraham;' and he saith, `Here `am' I;'"
1022012,1,22,12,"and He saith, `Put not forth thine hand unto the youth, nor do anything to him, for now I have known that thou art fearing God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one, from Me.'"
1022013,1,22,13,"And Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, a ram behind, seized in a thicket by its horns; and Abraham goeth, and taketh the ram, and causeth it to ascend for a burnt-offering instead of his son;"
1022014,1,22,14,"and Abraham calleth the name of that place `Jehovah-Jireh,' because it is said this day in the mount, `Jehovah doth provide.'"
1022015,1,22,15,"And the messenger of Jehovah calleth unto Abraham a second time from the heavens,"
1022016,1,22,16,"and saith, `By Myself I have sworn -- the affirmation of Jehovah -- that because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only one --"
1022017,1,22,17,"that blessing I bless thee, and multiplying I multiply thy seed as stars of the heavens, and as sand which `is' on the sea-shore; and thy seed doth possess the gate of his enemies;"
1022018,1,22,18,"and blessed themselves in thy seed have all nations of the earth, because that thou hast hearkened to My voice.'"
1022019,1,22,19,"And Abraham turneth back unto his young men, and they rise and go together unto Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwelleth in Beer-Sheba."
1022020,1,22,20,"And it cometh to pass after these things that it is declared to Abraham, saying, `Lo, Milcah hath borne, even she, sons to Nahor thy brother:"
1022021,1,22,21,"Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother; and Kemuel father of Aram,"
1022022,1,22,22,"and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;"
1022023,1,22,23,"and Bethuel hath begotten Rebekah;' these eight hath Milcah borne to Nahor, Abraham's brother;"
1022024,1,22,24,"and his concubine, whose name `is' Reumah, she also hath borne Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maachah."
1023001,1,23,1,And the life of Sarah is a hundred and twenty and seven years -- years of the life of Sarah;
1023002,1,23,2,"and Sarah dieth in Kirjath-Arba, which `is' Hebron, in the land of Caanan, and Abraham goeth in to mourn for Sarah, and to bewail her."
1023003,1,23,3,"And Abraham riseth up from the presence of his dead, and speaketh unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
1023004,1,23,4,"`A sojourner and a settler I `am' with you; give to me a possession of a burying-place with you, and I bury my dead from before me.'"
1023005,1,23,5,"And the sons of Heth answer Abraham, saying to him,"
1023006,1,23,6,"`Hear us, my lord; a prince of God `art' thou in our midst; in the choice of our burying-places bury thy dead: none of us his burying-place doth withhold from thee, from burying thy dead.'"
1023007,1,23,7,"And Abraham riseth and boweth himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,"
1023008,1,23,8,"and he speaketh with them, saying, `If it is your desire to bury my dead from before me, hear me, and meet for me with Ephron, son of Zoar;"
1023009,1,23,9,"and he giveth to me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which `is' in the extremity of his field; for full money doth he give it to me, in your midst, for a possession of a burying-place.'"
1023010,1,23,10,"And Ephron is sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth, and Ephron the Hittite answereth Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all those entering the gate of his city, saying,"
1023011,1,23,11,"`Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I have given to thee, and the cave that `is' in it, to thee I have given it; before the eyes of the sons of my people I have given it to thee -- bury thy dead.'"
1023012,1,23,12,"And Abraham boweth himself before the people of the land,"
1023013,1,23,13,"and speaketh unto Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, `Only -- if thou wouldst hear me -- I have given the money of the field -- accept from me, and I bury my dead there.'"
1023014,1,23,14,"And Ephron answereth Abraham, saying to him,"
1023015,1,23,15,"`My lord, hear me: the land -- four hundred shekels of silver; between me and thee, what `is' it? -- thy dead bury.'"
1023016,1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkeneth unto Ephron, and Abraham weigheth to Ephron the silver which he hath spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred silver shekels, passing with the merchant."
1023017,1,23,17,"And established are the field of Ephron, which `is' in Machpelah, which `is' before Mamre, the field and the cave which `is' in it, and all the trees which `are' in the field, which `are' in all its border round about,"
1023018,1,23,18,"to Abraham by purchase, before the eyes of the sons of Heth, among all entering the gate of his city."
1023019,1,23,19,"And after this hath Abraham buried Sarah his wife at the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (which `is' Hebron), in the land of Canaan;"
1023020,1,23,20,"and established are the field, and the cave which `is' in it, to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, from the sons of Heth."
1024001,1,24,1,"And Abraham `is' old, he hath entered into days, and Jehovah hath blessed Abraham in all `things';"
1024002,1,24,2,"and Abraham saith unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who is ruling over all that he hath, `Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,"
1024003,1,24,3,"and I cause thee to swear by Jehovah, God of the heavens, and God of the earth, that thou dost not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in the midst of whom I am dwelling;"
1024004,1,24,4,"but unto my land and unto my kindred dost thou go, and hast taken a wife for my son, for Isaac.'"
1024005,1,24,5,"And the servant saith unto him, `It may be the woman is not willing to come after me unto this land; do I at all cause thy son to turn back unto the land from whence thou camest out?'"
1024006,1,24,6,"And Abraham saith unto him, `Take heed to thyself, lest thou cause my son to turn back thither;"
1024007,1,24,7,"Jehovah, God of the heavens, who hath taken me from the house of my father, and from the land of my birth, and who hath spoken to me, and who hath sworn to me, saying, To thy seed I give this land, He doth send His messenger before thee, and thou hast taken a wife for my son from thence;"
1024008,1,24,8,"and if the woman be not willing to come after thee, then thou hast been acquitted from this mine oath: only my son thou dost not cause to turn back thither.'"
1024009,1,24,9,"And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and sweareth to him concerning this matter."
1024010,1,24,10,"And the servant taketh ten camels of the camels of his lord and goeth, also of all the goods of his lord in his hand, and he riseth, and goeth unto Aram-Naharaim, unto the city of Nahor;"
1024011,1,24,11,"and he causeth the camels to kneel at the outside of the city, at the well of water, at even-time, at the time of the coming out of the women who draw water."
1024012,1,24,12,"And he saith, `Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, cause to meet, I pray Thee, before me this day -- (and do kindness with my lord Abraham;"
1024013,1,24,13,"lo, I am standing by the fountain of water, and daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;"
1024014,1,24,14,"and it hath been, the young person unto whom I say, Incline, I pray thee, thy pitcher, and I drink, and she hath said, Drink, and I water also thy camels) -- her Thou hast decided for Thy servant, for Isaac; and by it I know that Thou hast done kindness with my lord.'"
1024015,1,24,15,"And it cometh to pass, before he hath finished speaking, that lo, Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham) is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder,"
1024016,1,24,16,"and the young person `is' of very good appearance, a virgin, and a man hath not known her; and she goeth down to the fountain, and filleth her pitcher, and cometh up."
1024017,1,24,17,"And the servant runneth to meet her, and saith, `Let me swallow, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher;'"
1024018,1,24,18,"and she saith, `Drink, my lord;' and she hasteth, and letteth down her pitcher upon her hand, and giveth him drink."
1024019,1,24,19,"And she finisheth giving him drink, and saith, `Also for thy camels I draw till they have finished drinking;'"
1024020,1,24,20,"and she hasteth, and emptieth her pitcher into the drinking-trough, and runneth again unto the well to draw, and draweth for all his camels."
1024021,1,24,21,"And the man, wondering at her, remaineth silent, to know whether Jehovah hath made his way prosperous or not."
1024022,1,24,22,"And it cometh to pass when the camels have finished drinking, that the man taketh a golden ring (whose weight `is' a bekah), and two bracelets for her hands (whose weight `is' ten `bekahs' of gold),"
1024023,1,24,23,"and saith, `Whose daughter `art' thou? declare to me, I pray thee, is the house of thy father a place for us to lodge in?'"
1024024,1,24,24,"And she saith unto him, `I `am' daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she hath borne to Nahor.'"
1024025,1,24,25,"She saith also unto him, `Both straw and provender `are' abundant with us, also a place to lodge in.'"
1024026,1,24,26,"And the man boweth, and doth obeisance to Jehovah,"
1024027,1,24,27,"and saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, who hath not left off His kindness and His truth with my lord; -- I `being' in the way, Jehovah hath led me to the house of my lord's brethren.'"
1024028,1,24,28,"And the young person runneth, and declareth to the house of her mother according to these words."
1024029,1,24,29,"And Rebekah hath a brother, and his name `is' Laban, and Laban runneth unto the man who `is' without, unto the fountain;"
1024030,1,24,30,"yea, it cometh to pass, when he seeth the ring, and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heareth the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, `Thus hath the man spoken unto me,' that he cometh in unto the man, and lo, he is standing by the camels by the fountain."
1024031,1,24,31,"And he saith, `Come in, O blessed one of Jehovah, why standest thou without, and I -- I have prepared the house and place for the camels!'"
1024032,1,24,32,"And he bringeth in the man into the house, and looseth the camels, and giveth straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who `are' with him:"
1024033,1,24,33,"and setteth before him to eat; but he saith, `I do not eat till I have spoken my word;' and he saith, `Speak.'"
1024034,1,24,34,"And he saith, `I `am' Abraham's servant;"
1024035,1,24,35,"and Jehovah hath blessed my lord exceedingly, and he is great; and He giveth to him flock, and herd, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses;"
1024036,1,24,36,"and Sarah, my lord's wife, beareth a son to my lord, after she hath been aged, and he giveth to him all that he hath."
1024037,1,24,37,"`And my lord causeth me to swear, saying, Thou dost not take a wife to my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling."
1024038,1,24,38,"If not -- unto the house of my father thou dost go, and unto my family, and thou hast taken a wife for my son."
1024039,1,24,39,"`And I say unto my lord, It may be the woman doth not come after me;"
1024040,1,24,40,"and he saith unto me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked habitually, doth send His messenger with thee, and hath prospered thy way, and thou hast taken a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father;"
1024041,1,24,41,"then art thou acquitted from my oath, when thou comest unto my family, and if they give not `one' to thee; then thou hast been acquitted from my oath."
1024042,1,24,42,"`And I come to-day unto the fountain, and I say, Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, if Thou art, I pray Thee, making prosperous my way in which I am going --"
1024043,1,24,43,"(lo, I am standing by the fountain of water), then the virgin who is coming out to draw, and I have said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher,"
1024044,1,24,44,"and she hath said unto me, Both drink thou, and also for thy camels I draw -- she is the woman whom Jehovah hath decided for my lord's son."
1024045,1,24,45,"`Before I finish speaking unto my heart, then lo, Rebekah is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder, and she goeth down to the fountain, and draweth; and I say unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee,"
1024046,1,24,46,"and she hasteth and letteth down her pitcher from off her and saith, Drink, and thy camels also I water; and I drink, and the camels also she hath watered."
1024047,1,24,47,"`And I ask her, and say, Whose daughter `art' thou? and she saith, Daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah hath borne to him, and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands,"
1024048,1,24,48,"and I bow, and do obeisance before Jehovah, and I bless Jehovah, God of my lord Abraham, who hath led me in the true way to receive the daughter of my lord's brother for his son."
1024049,1,24,49,"`And now, if ye are dealing kindly and truly with my lord, declare to me; and if not, declare to me; and I turn unto the right or unto the left.'"
1024050,1,24,50,"And Laban answereth -- Bethuel also -- and they say, `The thing hath gone out from Jehovah; we are not able to speak unto thee bad or good;"
1024051,1,24,51,"lo, Rebekah `is' before thee, take and go, and she is a wife to thy lord's son, as Jehovah hath spoken.'"
1024052,1,24,52,"And it cometh to pass, when the servant of Abraham hath heard their words, that he boweth himself towards the earth before Jehovah;"
1024053,1,24,53,"and the servant taketh out vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and giveth to Rebekah; precious things also he hath given to her brother and to her mother."
1024054,1,24,54,"And they eat and drink, he and the men who `are' with him, and lodge all night; and they rise in the morning, and he saith, `Send me to my lord;'"
1024055,1,24,55,"and her brother saith -- her mother also -- `Let the young person abide with us a week or ten days, afterwards doth she go.'"
1024056,1,24,56,"And he saith unto them, `Do not delay me, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away, and I go to my lord;'"
1024057,1,24,57,"and they say, `Let us call for the young person, and ask at her mouth;'"
1024058,1,24,58,"and they call for Rebekah, and say unto her, `Dost thou go with this man?' and she saith, `I go.'"
1024059,1,24,59,"And they send away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men;"
1024060,1,24,60,"and they bless Rebekah, and say to her, `Thou `art' our sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and thy seed doth possess the gate of those hating it.'"
1024061,1,24,61,"And Rebekah and her young women arise, and ride on the camels, and go after the man; and the servant taketh Rebekah and goeth."
1024062,1,24,62,"And Isaac hath come in from the entrance of the Well of the Living One, my Beholder; and he is dwelling in the land of the south,"
1024063,1,24,63,"and Isaac goeth out to meditate in the field, at the turning of the evening, and he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, camels are coming."
1024064,1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifteth up her eyes, and seeth Isaac, and alighteth from off the camel;"
1024065,1,24,65,"and she saith unto the servant, `Who `is' this man who is walking in the field to meet us?' and the servant saith, `It `is' my lord;' and she taketh the veil, and covereth herself."
1024066,1,24,66,"And the servant recounteth to Isaac all the things that he hath done,"
1024067,1,24,67,"and Isaac bringeth her in unto the tent of Sarah his mother, and he taketh Rebekah, and she becometh his wife, and he loveth her, and Isaac is comforted after `the death of' his mother."
1025001,1,25,1,"And Abraham addeth and taketh a wife, and her name `is' Keturah;"
1025002,1,25,2,"and she beareth to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
1025003,1,25,3,"And Jokshan hath begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim;"
1025004,1,25,4,"and the sons of Midian `are' Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah: all these `are' sons of Keturah."
1025005,1,25,5,And Abraham giveth all that he hath to Isaac;
1025006,1,25,6,"and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham hath, Abraham hath given gifts, and sendeth them away from Isaac his son (in his being yet alive) eastward, unto the east country."
1025007,1,25,7,"And these `are' the days of the years of the life of Abraham, which he lived, a hundred and seventy and five years;"
1025008,1,25,8,"and Abraham expireth, and dieth in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered unto his people."
1025009,1,25,9,"And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron, son of Zoar the Hittite, which `is' before Mamre --"
1025010,1,25,10,"the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth -- there hath Abraham been buried, and Sarah his wife."
1025011,1,25,11,"And it cometh to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blesseth Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelleth by the Well of the Living One, my Beholder."
1025012,1,25,12,"And these `are' births of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, hath borne to Abraham;"
1025013,1,25,13,"and these `are' the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their births: first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
1025014,1,25,14,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
1025015,1,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
1025016,1,25,16,"these are sons of Ishmael, and these their names, by their villages, and by their towers; twelve princes according to their peoples."
1025017,1,25,17,"And these `are' the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people;"
1025018,1,25,18,"and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur, which `is' before Egypt, in `thy' going towards Asshur; in the presence of all his brethren hath he fallen."
1025019,1,25,19,"And these `are' births of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham hath begotten Isaac;"
1025020,1,25,20,"and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean, from Padan-Aram, sister of Laban the Aramaean, to him for a wife."
1025021,1,25,21,"And Isaac maketh entreaty to Jehovah before his wife, for she `is' barren: and Jehovah is entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiveth,"
1025022,1,25,22,"and the children struggle together within her, and she saith, `If `it is' right -- why `am' I thus?' and she goeth to seek Jehovah."
1025023,1,25,23,"And Jehovah saith to her, `Two nations `are' in thy womb, and two peoples from thy bowels are parted; and the `one' people than the `other' people is stronger; and the elder doth serve the younger.'"
1025024,1,25,24,"And her days to bear are fulfilled, and lo, twins `are' in her womb;"
1025025,1,25,25,"and the first cometh out all red as a hairy robe, and they call his name Esau;"
1025026,1,25,26,"and afterwards hath his brother come out, and his hand is taking hold on Esau's heel, and one calleth his name Jacob; and Isaac `is' a son of sixty years in her bearing them."
1025027,1,25,27,"And the youths grew, and Esau is a man acquainted `with' hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob `is' a plain man, inhabiting tents;"
1025028,1,25,28,"and Isaac loveth Esau, for `his' hunting `is' in his mouth; and Rebekah is loving Jacob."
1025029,1,25,29,"And Jacob boileth pottage, and Esau cometh in from the field, and he `is' weary;"
1025030,1,25,30,"and Esau saith unto Jacob, `Let me eat, I pray thee, some of this red red thing, for I `am' weary;' therefore hath `one' called his name Edom `Red';"
1025031,1,25,31,"and Jacob saith, `Sell to-day thy birthright to me.'"
1025032,1,25,32,"And Esau saith, `Lo, I am going to die, and what is this to me -- birthright?'"
1025033,1,25,33,"and Jacob saith, `Swear to me to-day:' and he sweareth to him, and selleth his birthright to Jacob;"
1025034,1,25,34,"and Jacob hath given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he eateth, and drinketh, and riseth, and goeth; and Esau despiseth the birthright."
1026001,1,26,1,"And there is a famine in the land, besides the first famine which was in the days of Abraham, and Isaac goeth unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
1026002,1,26,2,"And Jehovah appeareth unto him, and saith, `Go not down towards Egypt, tabernacle in the land concerning which I speak unto thee,"
1026003,1,26,3,"sojourn in this land, and I am with thee, and bless thee, for to thee and to thy seed I give all these lands, and I have established the oath which I have sworn to Abraham thy father;"
1026004,1,26,4,"and I have multiplied thy seed as stars of the heavens, and I have given to thy seed all these lands; and blessed themselves in thy seed have all nations of the earth;"
1026005,1,26,5,"because that Abraham hath hearkened to My voice, and keepeth My charge, My commands, My statutes, and My laws.'"
1026006,1,26,6,And Isaac dwelleth in Gerar;
1026007,1,26,7,"and men of the place ask him of his wife, and he saith, `She `is' my sister:' for he hath been afraid to say, `My wife -- lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, for she `is' of good appearance.'"
1026008,1,26,8,"And it cometh to pass, when the days have been prolonged to him there, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looketh through the window, and seeth, and lo, Isaac is playing with Rebekah his wife."
1026009,1,26,9,"And Abimelech calleth for Isaac, and saith, `Lo, she `is' surely thy wife; and how hast thou said, She `is' my sister?' and Isaac saith unto him, `Because I said, Lest I die for her.'"
1026010,1,26,10,"And Abimelech saith, `What `is' this thou hast done to us? as a little thing one of the people had lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us guilt;'"
1026011,1,26,11,"and Abimelech commandeth all the people, saying, `He who cometh against this man or against his wife, dying doth die.'"
1026012,1,26,12,"And Isaac soweth in that land, and findeth in that year a hundredfold, and Jehovah blesseth him;"
1026013,1,26,13,"and the man is great, and goeth on, going on and becoming great, till that he hath been very great,"
1026014,1,26,14,"and he hath possession of a flock, and possession of a herd, and an abundant service; and the Philistines envy him,"
1026015,1,26,15,"and all the wells which his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines have stopped them, and fill them with dust."
1026016,1,26,16,"And Abimelech saith unto Isaac, `Go from us; for thou hast become much mightier than we;'"
1026017,1,26,17,"and Isaac goeth from thence, and encampeth in the valley of Gerar, and dwelleth there;"
1026018,1,26,18,"and Isaac turneth back, and diggeth the wells of water which they digged in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines do stop after the death of Abraham, and he calleth to them names according to the names which his father called them."
1026019,1,26,19,"And Isaac's servants dig in the valley, and find there a well of living water,"
1026020,1,26,20,"and shepherds of Gerar strive with shepherds of Isaac, saying, `The water `is' ours;' and he calleth the name of the well `Strife,' because they have striven habitually with him;"
1026021,1,26,21,"and they dig another well, and they strive also for it, and he calleth its name `Hatred.'"
1026022,1,26,22,"And he removeth from thence, and diggeth another well, and they have not striven for it, and he calleth its name Enlargements, and saith, `For -- now hath Jehovah given enlargement to us, and we have been fruitful in the land.'"
1026023,1,26,23,"And he goeth up from thence `to' Beer-Sheba,"
1026024,1,26,24,"and Jehovah appeareth unto him during that night, and saith, `I `am' the God of Abraham thy father, fear not, for I `am' with thee, and have blessed thee, and have multiplied thy seed, because of Abraham My servant;'"
1026025,1,26,25,"and he buildeth there an altar, and preacheth in the name of Jehovah, and stretcheth out there his tent, and there Isaac's servants dig a well."
1026026,1,26,26,"And Abimelech hath gone unto him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol head of his host;"
1026027,1,26,27,"and Isaac saith unto them, `Wherefore have ye come unto me, and ye have hated me, and ye send me away from you?'"
1026028,1,26,28,"And they say, `We have certainly seen that Jehovah hath been with thee, and we say, `Let there be, we pray thee, an oath between us, between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;"
1026029,1,26,29,"do not evil with us, as we have not touched thee, and as we have only done good with thee, and send thee away in peace; thou `art' now blessed of Jehovah.'"
1026030,1,26,30,"And he maketh for them a banquet, and they eat and drink,"
1026031,1,26,31,"and rise early in the morning, and swear one to another, and Isaac sendeth them away, and they go from him in peace."
1026032,1,26,32,"And it cometh to pass during that day that Isaac's servants come and declare to him concerning the circumstances of the well which they have digged, and say to him, `We have found water;'"
1026033,1,26,33,"and he calleth it Shebah, `oath,' therefore the name of the city `is' Beer-Sheba, `well of the oath,' unto this day."
1026034,1,26,34,"And Esau is a son of forty years, and he taketh a wife, Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite,"
1026035,1,26,35,and they are a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.
1027001,1,27,1,"And it cometh to pass that Isaac `is' aged, and his eyes are too dim for seeing, and he calleth Esau his elder son, and saith unto him, `My son;' and he saith unto him, `Here `am' I.'"
1027002,1,27,2,"And he saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have become aged, I have not known the day of my death;"
1027003,1,27,3,"and now, take up, I pray thee, thy instruments, thy quiver, and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me provision,"
1027004,1,27,4,"and make for me tasteful things, `such' as I have loved, and bring in to me, and I do eat, so that my soul doth bless thee before I die.'"
1027005,1,27,5,And Rebekah is hearkening while Isaac is speaking unto Esau his son; and Esau goeth to the field to hunt provision -- to bring in;
1027006,1,27,6,"and Rebekah hath spoken unto Jacob her son, saying, `Lo, I have heard thy father speaking unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
1027007,1,27,7,"Bring for me provision, and make for me tasteful things, and I do eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death."
1027008,1,27,8,"`And now, my son, hearken to my voice, to that which I am commanding thee:"
1027009,1,27,9,"Go, I pray thee, unto the flock, and take for me from thence two good kids of the goats, and I make them tasteful things for thy father, `such' as he hath loved;"
1027010,1,27,10,"and thou hast taken in to thy father, and he hath eaten, so that his soul doth bless thee before his death."
1027011,1,27,11,"And Jacob saith unto Rebekah his mother, `Lo, Esau my brother `is' a hairy man, and I a smooth man,"
1027012,1,27,12,"it may be my father doth feel me, and I have been in his eyes as a deceiver, and have brought upon me disesteem, and not a blessing;'"
1027013,1,27,13,"and his mother saith to him, `On me thy disesteem, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go, take for me.'"
1027014,1,27,14,"And he goeth, and taketh, and bringeth to his mother, and his mother maketh tasteful things, `such' as his father hath loved;"
1027015,1,27,15,"and Rebekah taketh the desirable garments of Esau her elder son, which `are' with her in the house, and doth put on Jacob her younger son;"
1027016,1,27,16,"and the skins of the kids of the goats she hath put on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck,"
1027017,1,27,17,"and she giveth the tasteful things, and the bread which she hath made, into the hand of Jacob her son."
1027018,1,27,18,"And he cometh in unto his father, and saith, `My father;' and he saith, `Here `am' I; who `art' thou, my son?'"
1027019,1,27,19,"And Jacob saith unto his father, `I `am' Esau thy first-born; I have done as thou hast spoken unto me; rise, I pray thee, sit, and eat of my provision, so that thy soul doth bless me.'"
1027020,1,27,20,"And Isaac saith unto his son, `What `is' this thou hast hasted to find, my son?' and he saith, `That which Jehovah thy God hath caused to come before me.'"
1027021,1,27,21,"And Isaac saith unto Jacob, `Come nigh, I pray thee, and I feel thee, my son, whether thou `art' he, my son Esau, or not.'"
1027022,1,27,22,"And Jacob cometh nigh unto Isaac his father, and he feeleth him, and saith, `The voice `is' the voice of Jacob, and the hands hands of Esau.'"
1027023,1,27,23,"And he hath not discerned him, for his hands have been hairy, as the hands of Esau his brother, and he blesseth him,"
1027024,1,27,24,"and saith, `Thou art he -- my son Esau?' and he saith, `I `am'.'"
1027025,1,27,25,"And he saith, `Bring nigh to me, and I do eat of my son's provision, so that my soul doth bless thee;' and he bringeth nigh to him, and he eateth; and he bringeth to him wine, and he drinketh."
1027026,1,27,26,"And Isaac his father saith to him, `Come nigh, I pray thee, and kiss me, my son;'"
1027027,1,27,27,"and he cometh nigh, and kisseth him, and he smelleth the fragrance of his garments, and blesseth him, and saith, `See, the fragrance of my son `is' as the fragrance of a field which Jehovah hath blessed;"
1027028,1,27,28,"and God doth give to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine;"
1027029,1,27,29,"peoples serve thee, and nations bow themselves to thee, be thou mighty over thy brethren, and the sons of thy mother bow themselves to thee; those who curse thee `are' cursed, and those who bless thee `are' blessed.'"
1027030,1,27,30,"And it cometh to pass, as Isaac hath finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob is only just going out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother hath come in from his hunting;"
1027031,1,27,31,"and he also maketh tasteful things, and bringeth to his father, and saith to his father, `Let my father arise, and eat of his son's provision, so that thy soul doth bless me.'"
1027032,1,27,32,"And Isaac his father saith to him, `Who `art' thou?' and he saith, `I `am' thy son, thy first-born, Esau;'"
1027033,1,27,33,"and Isaac trembleth a very great trembling, and saith, `Who, now, `is' he who hath provided provision, and bringeth in to me, and I eat of all before thou comest in, and I bless him? -- yea, blessed is he.'"
1027034,1,27,34,"When Esau heareth the words of his father, then he crieth a very great and bitter cry, and saith to his father, `Bless me, me also, O my father;'"
1027035,1,27,35,"and he saith, `Thy brother hath come with subtilty, and taketh thy blessing.'"
1027036,1,27,36,"And he saith, `Is it because `one' called his name Jacob that he doth take me by the heel these two times? my birthright he hath taken; and lo, now, he hath taken my blessing;' he saith also, `Hast thou not kept back a blessing for me?'"
1027037,1,27,37,"And Isaac answereth and saith to Esau, `Lo, a mighty one have I set him over thee, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants, and `with' corn and wine have I sustained him; and for thee now, what shall I do, my son?'"
1027038,1,27,38,"And Esau saith unto his father, `One blessing hast thou my father? bless me, me also, O my father;' and Esau lifteth up his voice, and weepeth."
1027039,1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answereth and saith unto him, `Lo, of the fatness of the earth is thy dwelling, and of the dew of the heavens from above;"
1027040,1,27,40,"and by thy sword dost thou live, and thy brother dost thou serve; and it hath come to pass when thou rulest, that thou hast broken his yoke from off thy neck.'"
1027041,1,27,41,"And Esau hateth Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau saith in his heart, `The days of mourning `for' my father draw near, and I slay Jacob my brother.'"
1027042,1,27,42,"And the words of Esau her elder son are declared to Rebekah, and she sendeth and calleth for Jacob her younger son, and saith unto him, `Lo, Esau thy brother is comforting himself in regard to thee -- to slay thee;"
1027043,1,27,43,"and now, my son, hearken to my voice, and rise, flee for thyself unto Laban my brother, to Haran,"
1027044,1,27,44,"and thou hast dwelt with him some days, till thy brother's fury turn back,"
1027045,1,27,45,"till thy brother's anger turn back from thee, and he hath forgotten that which thou hast done to him, and I have sent and taken thee from thence; why am I bereaved even of you both the same day?'"
1027046,1,27,46,"And Rebekah saith unto Isaac, `I have been disgusted with my life because of the presence of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these -- from the daughters of the land -- why do I live?'"
1028001,1,28,1,"And Isaac calleth unto Jacob, and blesseth him, and commandeth him, and saith to him, `Thou dost not take a wife of the daughters of Caanan;"
1028002,1,28,2,"rise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take for thyself from thence a wife, of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother;"
1028003,1,28,3,"and God Almighty doth bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and thou hast become an assembly of peoples;"
1028004,1,28,4,"and He doth give to thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, to cause thee to possess the land of thy sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.'"
1028005,1,28,5,"And Isaac sendeth away Jacob, and he goeth to Padan-Aram, unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau."
1028006,1,28,6,"And Esau seeth that Isaac hath blessed Jacob, and hath sent him to Padan-Aram to take to himself from thence a wife -- in his blessing him that he layeth a charge upon him, saying, Thou dost not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan --"
1028007,1,28,7,"that Jacob hearkeneth unto his father and unto his mother, and goeth to Padan-Aram --"
1028008,1,28,8,"and Esau seeth that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of Isaac his father,"
1028009,1,28,9,"and Esau goeth unto Ishmael, and taketh Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, sister of Nebajoth, unto his wives, to himself, for a wife."
1028010,1,28,10,"And Jacob goeth out from Beer-Sheba, and goeth toward Haran,"
1028011,1,28,11,"and he toucheth at a `certain' place, and lodgeth there, for the sun hath gone in, and he taketh of the stones of the place, and maketh `them' his pillows, and lieth down in that place."
1028012,1,28,12,"And he dreameth, and lo, a ladder set up on the earth, and its head is touching the heavens; and lo, messengers of God are going up and coming down by it;"
1028013,1,28,13,"and lo, Jehovah is standing upon it, and He saith, `I `am' Jehovah, God of Abraham thy father, and God of Isaac; the land on which thou art lying, to thee I give it, and to thy seed;"
1028014,1,28,14,"and thy seed hath been as the dust of the land, and thou hast broken forth westward, and eastward, and northward, and southward, and all families of the ground have been blessed in thee and in thy seed."
1028015,1,28,15,"`And lo, I `am' with thee, and have kept thee whithersoever thou goest, and have caused thee to turn back unto this ground; for I leave thee not till that I have surely done that which I have spoken to thee.'"
1028016,1,28,16,"And Jacob awaketh out of his sleep, and saith, `Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew not;'"
1028017,1,28,17,"and he feareth, and saith, `How fearful `is' this place; this is nothing but a house of God, and this a gate of the heavens.'"
1028018,1,28,18,"And Jacob riseth early in the morning, and taketh the stone which he hath made his pillows, and maketh it a standing pillar, and poureth oil upon its top,"
1028019,1,28,19,"and he calleth the name of that place Bethel, `house of God,' and yet, Luz `is' the name of the city at the first."
1028020,1,28,20,"And Jacob voweth a vow, saying, `Seeing God is with me, and hath kept me in this way which I am going, and hath given to me bread to eat, and a garment to put on --"
1028021,1,28,21,"when I have turned back in peace unto the house of my father, and Jehovah hath become my God,"
1028022,1,28,22,"then this stone which I have made a standing pillar is a house of God, and all that Thou dost give to me -- tithing I tithe to Thee.'"
1029001,1,29,1,"And Jacob lifteth up his feet, and goeth towards the land of the sons of the east;"
1029002,1,29,2,"and he looketh, and lo, a well in the field, and lo, there three droves of a flock crouching by it, for from that well they water the droves, and the great stone `is' on the mouth of the well."
1029003,1,29,3,"(When thither have all the droves been gathered, and they have rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well, and have watered the flock, then they have turned back the stone on the mouth of the well to its place.)"
1029004,1,29,4,"And Jacob saith to them, `My brethren, from whence `are' ye?' and they say, `We `are' from Haran.'"
1029005,1,29,5,"And he saith to them, `Have ye known Laban, son of Nahor?' and they say, `We have known.'"
1029006,1,29,6,"And he saith to them, `Hath he peace?' and they say, `Peace; and lo, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.'"
1029007,1,29,7,"And he saith, `Lo, the day `is' still great, `it is' not time for the cattle to be gathered; water ye the flock, and go, delight yourselves.'"
1029008,1,29,8,"And they say, `We are not able, till that all the droves be gathered together, and they have rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we have watered the flock.'"
1029009,1,29,9,"He is yet speaking with them, and Rachel hath come with the flock which her father hath, for she `is' shepherdess;"
1029010,1,29,10,"and it cometh to pass when Jacob hath seen Rachel, daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob cometh nigh and rolleth the stone from off the mouth of the well, and watereth the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
1029011,1,29,11,"And Jacob kisseth Rachel, and lifteth up his voice, and weepeth,"
1029012,1,29,12,"and Jacob declareth to Rachel that he `is' her father's brother, and that he `is' Rebekah's son, and she runneth and declareth to her father."
1029013,1,29,13,"And it cometh to pass, when Laban heareth the report of Jacob his sister's son, that he runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and kisseth him, and bringeth him in unto his house; and he recounteth to Laban all these things,"
1029014,1,29,14,"and Laban saith to him, `Only my bone and my flesh `art' thou;' and he dwelleth with him a month of days."
1029015,1,29,15,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `Is it because thou `art' my brother that thou hast served me for nought? declare to me what `is' thy hire.'"
1029016,1,29,16,"And Laban hath two daughters, the name of the elder `is' Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel,"
1029017,1,29,17,"and the eyes of Leah `are' tender, and Rachel hath been fair of form and fair of appearance."
1029018,1,29,18,"And Jacob loveth Rachel, and saith, `I serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter:'"
1029019,1,29,19,"and Laban saith, `It is better for me to give her to thee than to give her to another man; dwell with me;'"
1029020,1,29,20,"and Jacob serveth for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days, because of his loving her."
1029021,1,29,21,"And Jacob saith unto Laban, `Give up my wife, for my days have been fulfilled, and I go in unto her;'"
1029022,1,29,22,"and Laban gathereth all the men of the place, and maketh a banquet."
1029023,1,29,23,"And it cometh to pass in the evening, that he taketh Leah, his daughter, and bringeth her in unto him, and he goeth in unto her;"
1029024,1,29,24,"and Laban giveth to her Zilpah, his maid-servant, to Leah his daughter, a maid-servant."
1029025,1,29,25,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that lo, it `is' Leah; and he saith unto Laban, `What `is' this thou hast done to me? for Rachel have I not served with thee? and why hast thou deceived me?'"
1029026,1,29,26,"And Laban saith, `It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the first-born;"
1029027,1,29,27,"fulfil the week of this one, and we give to thee also this one, for the service which thou dost serve with me yet seven other years.'"
1029028,1,29,28,"And Jacob doth so, and fulfilleth the week of this one, and he giveth to him Rachel his daughter, to him for a wife;"
1029029,1,29,29,"and Laban giveth to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maid-servant, for a maid-servant to her."
1029030,1,29,30,"And he goeth in also unto Rachel, and he also loveth Rachel more than Leah; and he serveth with him yet seven other years."
1029031,1,29,31,"And Jehovah seeth that Leah `is' the hated one, and He openeth her womb, and Rachel `is' barren;"
1029032,1,29,32,"and Leah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Reuben, for she said, `Because Jehovah hath looked on mine affliction; because now doth my husband love me.'"
1029033,1,29,33,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, `Because Jehovah hath heard that I `am' the hated one, He also giveth to me even this `one';' and she calleth his name Simeon."
1029034,1,29,34,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, `Now `is' the time, my husband is joined unto me, because I have born to him three sons,' therefore hath `one' called his name Levi."
1029035,1,29,35,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith this time, `I praise Jehovah;' therefore hath she called his name Judah; and she ceaseth from bearing."
1030001,1,30,1,"And Rachel seeth that she hath not borne to Jacob, and Rachel is envious of her sister, and saith unto Jacob, `Give me sons, and if there is none -- I die.'"
1030002,1,30,2,"And Jacob's anger burneth against Rachel, and he saith, `Am I in stead of God who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?'"
1030003,1,30,3,"And she saith, `Lo, my handmaid Bilhah, go in unto her, and she doth bear on my knees, and I am built up, even I, from her;'"
1030004,1,30,4,"and she giveth to him Bilhah her maid-servant for a wife, and Jacob goeth in unto her;"
1030005,1,30,5,"and Bilhah conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son,"
1030006,1,30,6,"and Rachel saith, `God hath decided for me, and also hath hearkened to my voice, and giveth to me a son;' therefore hath she called his name Dan."
1030007,1,30,7,"And Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant, conceiveth again, and beareth a second son to Jacob,"
1030008,1,30,8,"and Rachel saith, `With wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, yea, I have prevailed;' and she calleth his name Napthali."
1030009,1,30,9,"And Leah seeth that she hath ceased from bearing, and she taketh Zilpah her maid-servant, and giveth her to Jacob for a wife;"
1030010,1,30,10,"and Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth to Jacob a son,"
1030011,1,30,11,"and Leah saith, `A troop is coming;' and she calleth his name Gad."
1030012,1,30,12,"And Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth a second son to Jacob,"
1030013,1,30,13,"and Leah saith, `Because of my happiness, for daughters have pronounced me happy;' and she calleth his name Asher."
1030014,1,30,14,"And Reuben goeth in the days of wheat-harvest, and findeth love-apples in the field, and bringeth them in unto Leah, his mother, and Rachel saith unto Leah, `Give to me, I pray thee, of the love-apples of thy son.'"
1030015,1,30,15,"And she saith to her, `Is thy taking my husband a little thing, that thou hast taken also the love-apples of my son?' and Rachel saith, `Therefore doth he lie with thee to-night, for thy son's love-apples.'"
1030016,1,30,16,"And Jacob cometh in from the field at evening; and Leah goeth to meet him, and saith, `Unto me dost thou come in, for hiring I have hired thee with my son's love-apples;' and he lieth with her during that night."
1030017,1,30,17,"And God hearkeneth unto Leah, and she conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son, a fifth,"
1030018,1,30,18,"and Leah saith, `God hath given my hire, because I have given my maid-servant to my husband;' and she calleth his name Issachar."
1030019,1,30,19,"And conceive again doth Leah, and she beareth a sixth son to Jacob,"
1030020,1,30,20,"and Leah saith, `God hath endowed me -- a good dowry; this time doth my husband dwell with me, for I have borne to him six sons;' and she calleth his name Zebulun;"
1030021,1,30,21,"and afterwards hath she born a daughter, and calleth her name Dinah."
1030022,1,30,22,"And God remembereth Rachel, and God hearkeneth unto her, and openeth her womb,"
1030023,1,30,23,"and she conceiveth and beareth a son, and saith, `God hath gathered up my reproach;'"
1030024,1,30,24,"and she calleth his name Joseph, saying, `Jehovah is adding to me another son.'"
1030025,1,30,25,"And it cometh to pass, when Rachel hath borne Joseph, that Jacob saith unto Laban, `Send me away, and I go unto my place, and to my land;"
1030026,1,30,26,"give up my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and I go; for thou -- thou hast known my service which I have served thee.'"
1030027,1,30,27,"And Laban saith unto him, `If, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes -- I have observed diligently that Jehovah doth bless me for thy sake.'"
1030028,1,30,28,"He saith also, `Define thy hire to me, and I give.'"
1030029,1,30,29,"And he saith unto him, `Thou -- thou hast known that which I have served thee `in', and that which thy substance was with me;"
1030030,1,30,30,"for `it is' little which thou hast had at my appearance, and it breaketh forth into a multitude, and Jehovah blesseth thee at my coming; and now, when do I make, I also, for mine own house?'"
1030031,1,30,31,"And he saith, `What do I give to thee?' And Jacob saith, `Thou dost not give me anything; if thou do for me this thing, I turn back; I have delight; thy flock I watch;"
1030032,1,30,32,"I pass through all thy flock to-day to turn aside from thence every sheep speckled and spotted, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats -- and it hath been my hire;"
1030033,1,30,33,"and my righteousness hath answered for me in the day to come, when it cometh in for my hire before thy face; -- every one which is not speckled and spotted among `my' goats, and brown among `my' lambs -- it is stolen with me.'"
1030034,1,30,34,"And Laban saith, `Lo, O that it were according to thy word;'"
1030035,1,30,35,"and he turneth aside during that day the ring-straked and the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted she-goats, every one that `hath' white in it, and every brown one among the lambs, and he giveth into the hand of his sons,"
1030036,1,30,36,and setteth a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.
1030037,1,30,37,"And Jacob taketh to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut, and doth peel in them white peelings, making bare the white that `is' on the rods,"
1030038,1,30,38,"and setteth up the rods which he hath peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock cometh in to drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their coming in to drink;"
1030039,1,30,39,"and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth ring-straked, speckled, and spotted ones."
1030040,1,30,40,"And the lambs hath Jacob parted, and he putteth the face of the flock towards the ring-straked, also all the brown in the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by themselves, and hath not set them near Laban's flock."
1030041,1,30,41,"And it hath come to pass whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,"
1030042,1,30,42,"and when the flock is feeble, he doth not set `them'; and the feeble ones have been Laban's, and the strong ones Jacob's."
1030043,1,30,43,"And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and hath many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses."
1031001,1,31,1,"And he heareth the words of Laban's sons, saying, `Jacob hath taken all that our father hath; yea, from that which our father hath, he hath made all this honour;'"
1031002,1,31,2,"and Jacob seeth the face of Laban, and lo, it is not with him as heretofore."
1031003,1,31,3,"And Jehovah saith unto Jacob, `Turn back unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I am with thee.'"
1031004,1,31,4,And Jacob sendeth and calleth for Rachel and for Leah to the field unto his flock;
1031005,1,31,5,"and saith to them, `I am beholding your father's face -- that it is not towards me as heretofore, and the God of my father hath been with me,"
1031006,1,31,6,"and ye -- ye have known that with all my power I have served your father,"
1031007,1,31,7,"and your father hath played upon me, and hath changed my hire ten times; and God hath not suffered him to do evil with me."
1031008,1,31,8,"`If he say thus: The speckled are thy hire, then bare all the flock speckled ones; and if he say thus: The ring-straked are thy hire, then bare all the flock ring-straked;"
1031009,1,31,9,"and God taketh away the substance of your father, and doth give to me."
1031010,1,31,10,"`And it cometh to pass at the time of the flock conceiving, that I lift up mine eyes and see in a dream, and lo, the he-goats, which are going up on the flock, `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled;"
1031011,1,31,11,"and the messenger of God saith unto me in the dream, Jacob, and I say, Here `am' I."
1031012,1,31,12,"`And He saith, Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see -- all the he-goats which are going up on the flock `are' ring-straked, speckled, and grisled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to thee;"
1031013,1,31,13,"I `am' the God of Bethel where thou hast anointed a standing pillar, where thou hast vowed a vow to me; now, arise, go out from this land, and turn back unto the land of thy birth.'"
1031014,1,31,14,"And Rachel answereth -- Leah also -- and saith to him, `Have we yet a portion and inheritance in the house of our father?"
1031015,1,31,15,"have we not been reckoned strangers to him? for he hath sold us, and he also utterly consumeth our money;"
1031016,1,31,16,"for all the wealth which God hath taken away from our father, it `is' ours, and our children's; and now, all that God hath said unto thee -- do.'"
1031017,1,31,17,"And Jacob riseth, and lifteth up his sons and his wives on the camels,"
1031018,1,31,18,"and leadeth all his cattle, and all his substance which he hath acquired, the cattle of his getting, which he hath acquired in Padan-Aram, to go unto Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan."
1031019,1,31,19,"And Laban hath gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stealeth the teraphim which her father hath;"
1031020,1,31,20,"and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean, because he hath not declared to him that he is fleeing;"
1031021,1,31,21,"and he fleeth, he and all that he hath, and riseth, and passeth over the River, and setteth his face `toward' the mount of Gilead."
1031022,1,31,22,"And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob hath fled,"
1031023,1,31,23,"and he taketh his brethren with him, and pursueth after him a journey of seven days, and overtaketh him in the mount of Gilead."
1031024,1,31,24,"And God cometh in unto Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good unto evil.'"
1031025,1,31,25,And Laban overtaketh Jacob; and Jacob hath fixed his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren have fixed `theirs' in the mount of Gilead.
1031026,1,31,26,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `What hast thou done that thou dost deceive my heart, and lead away my daughters as captives of the sword?"
1031027,1,31,27,"Why hast thou hidden thyself to flee, and deceivest me, and hast not declared to me, and I send thee away with joy and with songs, with tabret and with harp,"
1031028,1,31,28,and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? -- now thou hast acted foolishly in doing `so';
1031029,1,31,29,"my hand is to God to do evil with you, but the God of your father yesternight hath spoken unto me, saying, Take heed to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good unto evil."
1031030,1,31,30,"`And now, thou hast certainly gone, because thou hast been very desirous for the house of thy father; why hast thou stolen my gods?'"
1031031,1,31,31,"And Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou take violently away thy daughters from me;"
1031032,1,31,32,"with whomsoever thou findest thy gods -- he doth not live; before our brethren discern for thyself what `is' with me, and take to thyself:' and Jacob hath not known that Rachel hath stolen them."
1031033,1,31,33,"And Laban goeth into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two handmaidens, and hath not found; and he goeth out from the tent of Leah, and goeth into the tent of Rachel."
1031034,1,31,34,"And Rachel hath taken the teraphim, and putteth them in the furniture of the camel, and sitteth upon them; and Laban feeleth all the tent, and hath not found;"
1031035,1,31,35,"and she saith unto her father, `Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I am not able to rise at thy presence, for the way of women `is' on me;' and he searcheth, and hath not found the teraphim."
1031036,1,31,36,"And it is displeasing to Jacob, and he striveth with Laban; and Jacob answereth and saith to Laban, `What `is' my transgression? what my sin, that thou hast burned after me?"
1031037,1,31,37,"for thou hast felt all my vessels: what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? set here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and they decide between us both."
1031038,1,31,38,"`These twenty years I `am' with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not miscarried, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten;"
1031039,1,31,39,"the torn I have not brought in unto thee -- I, I repay it -- from my hand thou dost seek it; I have been deceived by day, and I have been deceived by night;"
1031040,1,31,40,"I have been `thus': in the day consumed me hath drought, and frost by night, and wander doth my sleep from mine eyes."
1031041,1,31,41,"`This `is' to me twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou changest my hire ten times;"
1031042,1,31,42,"unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been for me, surely now empty thou hadst sent me away; mine affliction and the labour of my hands hath God seen, and reproveth yesternight.'"
1031043,1,31,43,"And Laban answereth and saith unto Jacob, `The daughters `are' my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flock my flock, and all that thou art seeing `is' mine; and to my daughters -- what do I to these to-day, or to their sons whom they have born?"
1031044,1,31,44,"and now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and it hath been for a witness between me and thee.'"
1031045,1,31,45,"And Jacob taketh a stone, and lifteth it up `for' a standing pillar;"
1031046,1,31,46,"and Jacob saith to his brethren, `Gather stones,' and they take stones, and make a heap; and they eat there on the heap;"
1031047,1,31,47,and Laban calleth it Jegar-Sahadutha; and Jacob hath called it Galeed.
1031048,1,31,48,"And Laban saith, `This heap `is' witness between me and thee to-day;' therefore hath he called its name Galeed;"
1031049,1,31,49,"Mizpah also, for he said, `Jehovah doth watch between me and thee, for we are hidden one from another;"
1031050,1,31,50,"if thou afflict my daughters, or take wives beside my daughters -- there is no man with us -- see, God `is' witness between me and thee.'"
1031051,1,31,51,"And Laban saith to Jacob, `Lo, this heap, and lo, the standing pillar which I have cast between me and thee;"
1031052,1,31,52,"this heap `is' witness, and the standing pillar `is' witness, that I do not pass over this heap unto thee, and that thou dost not pass over this heap and this standing pillar unto me -- for evil;"
1031053,1,31,53,"the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, doth judge between us -- the God of their father,' and Jacob sweareth by the Fear of his father Isaac."
1031054,1,31,54,"And Jacob sacrificeth a sacrifice in the mount, and calleth to his brethren to eat bread, and they eat bread, and lodge in the mount;"
1031055,1,31,55,"and Laban riseth early in the morning, and kisseth his sons and his daughters, and blesseth them; and Laban goeth on, and turneth back to his place."
1032001,1,32,1,"And Jacob hath gone on his way, and messengers of God come upon him;"
1032002,1,32,2,"and Jacob saith, when he hath seen them, `This `is' the camp of God;' and he calleth the name of that place `Two Camps.'"
1032003,1,32,3,"And Jacob sendeth messengers before him unto Esau his brother, towards the land of Seir, the field of Edom,"
1032004,1,32,4,"and commandeth them, saying, `Thus do ye say to my lord, to Esau: Thus said thy servant Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned, and I tarry until now;"
1032005,1,32,5,"and I have ox, and ass, flock, and man-servant, and maid-servant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace in his eyes.'"
1032006,1,32,6,"And the messengers turn back unto Jacob, saying, `We came in unto thy brother, unto Esau, and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him;'"
1032007,1,32,7,"and Jacob feareth exceedingly, and is distressed, and he divideth the people who `are' with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps,"
1032008,1,32,8,"and saith, `If Esau come in unto the one camp, and have smitten it -- then the camp which is left hath been for an escape.'"
1032009,1,32,9,"And Jacob saith, `God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who saith unto me, Turn back to thy land, and to thy kindred, and I do good with thee:"
1032010,1,32,10,"I have been unworthy of all the kind acts, and of all the truth which Thou hast done with thy servant -- for, with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps."
1032011,1,32,11,"`Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, less he come and have smitten me -- mother beside sons;"
1032012,1,32,12,"and Thou -- Thou hast said, I certainly do good with thee, and have set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered because of the multitude.'"
1032013,1,32,13,"And he lodgeth there during that night, and taketh from that which is coming into his hand, a present for Esau his brother:"
1032014,1,32,14,"she-goats two hundred, and he-goats twenty, ewes two hundred, and rams twenty,"
1032015,1,32,15,"suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty, and bullocks ten, she-asses twenty, and foals ten;"
1032016,1,32,16,"and he giveth into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and saith unto his servants, `Pass over before me, and a space ye do put between drove and drove.'"
1032017,1,32,17,"And he commandeth the first, saying, `When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and hath asked thee, saying, Whose `art' thou? and whither goest thou? and whose `are' these before thee?"
1032018,1,32,18,"then thou hast said, Thy servant Jacob's: it `is' a present sent to my lord, to Esau; and lo, he also `is' behind us.'"
1032019,1,32,19,"And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also all who are going after the droves, saying, `According to this manner do ye speak unto Esau in your finding him,"
1032020,1,32,20,"and ye have said also, Lo, thy servant Jacob `is' behind us;' for he said, `I pacify his face with the present which is going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he lifteth up my face;'"
1032021,1,32,21,"and the present passeth over before his face, and he hath lodged during that night in the camp."
1032022,1,32,22,"And he riseth in that night, and taketh his two wives, and his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth over the passage of Jabbok;"
1032023,1,32,23,"and he taketh them, and causeth them to pass over the brook, and he causeth that which he hath to pass over."
1032024,1,32,24,"And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till the ascending of the dawn;"
1032025,1,32,25,"and he seeth that he is not able for him, and he cometh against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him;"
1032026,1,32,26,"and he saith, `Send me away, for the dawn hath ascended:' and he saith, `I send thee not away, except thou hast blessed me.'"
1032027,1,32,27,"And he saith unto him, `What `is' thy name?' and he saith, `Jacob.'"
1032028,1,32,28,"And he saith, `Thy name is no more called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast been a prince with God and with men, and dost prevail.'"
1032029,1,32,29,"And Jacob asketh, and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, thy name;' and he saith, `Why `is' this, thou askest for My name?' and He blesseth him there."
1032030,1,32,30,"And Jacob calleth the name of the place Peniel: for `I have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;'"
1032031,1,32,31,"and the sun riseth on him when he hath passed over Penuel, and he is halting on his thigh;"
1032032,1,32,32,"therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank, which `is' on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because He came against the hollow of Jacob's thigh, against the sinew which shrank."
1033001,1,33,1,"And Jacob lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, Esau is coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divideth the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two maid-servants;"
1033002,1,33,2,"and he setteth the maid-servants and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last."
1033003,1,33,3,"And he himself passed over before them, and boweth himself to the earth seven times, until his drawing nigh unto his brother,"
1033004,1,33,4,"and Esau runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and falleth on his neck, and kisseth him, and they weep;"
1033005,1,33,5,"and he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the women and the children, and saith, `What `are' these to thee?' And he saith, `The children with whom God hath favoured thy servant.'"
1033006,1,33,6,"And the maid-servants draw nigh, they and their children, and bow themselves;"
1033007,1,33,7,"and Leah also draweth nigh, and her children, and they bow themselves; and afterwards Joseph hath drawn nigh with Rachel, and they bow themselves."
1033008,1,33,8,"And he saith, `What to thee `is' all this camp which I have met?' and he saith, `To find grace in the eyes of my lord.'"
1033009,1,33,9,"And Esau saith, `I have abundance, my brother, let it be to thyself that which thou hast.'"
1033010,1,33,10,"And Jacob saith, `Nay, I pray thee, if, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, then thou hast received my present from my hand, because that I have seen thy face, as the seeing of the face of God, and thou art pleased with me;"
1033011,1,33,11,"receive, I pray thee, my blessing, which is brought to thee, because God hath favoured me, and because I have all `things';' and he presseth on him, and he receiveth,"
1033012,1,33,12,"and saith, `Let us journey and go on, and I go on before thee.'"
1033013,1,33,13,"And he saith unto him, `My lord knoweth that the children `are' tender, and the suckling flock and the herd `are' with me; when they have beaten them one day, then hath all the flock died."
1033014,1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I -- I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work which `is' before me, and to the foot of the children, until that I come unto my lord, to Seir.'"
1033015,1,33,15,"And Esau saith, `Let me, I pray thee, place with thee some of the people who `are' with me;' and he said, `Why `is' this? I find grace in the eyes of my lord.'"
1033016,1,33,16,And turn back on that day doth Esau on his way to Seir;
1033017,1,33,17,"and Jacob hath journeyed to Succoth, and buildeth to himself a house, and for his cattle hath made booths, therefore hath he called the name of the place Succoth."
1033018,1,33,18,"And Jacob cometh in to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which `is' in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and encampeth before the city,"
1033019,1,33,19,"and he buyeth the portion of the field where he hath stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitah;"
1033020,1,33,20,"and he setteth up there an altar, and proclaimeth at it God -- the God of Israel."
1034001,1,34,1,"And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she hath borne to Jacob, goeth out to look on the daughters of the land,"
1034002,1,34,2,"and Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land, seeth her, and taketh her, and lieth with her, and humbleth her;"
1034003,1,34,3,"and his soul cleaveth to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and he loveth the young person, and speaketh unto the heart of the young person."
1034004,1,34,4,"And Shechem speaketh unto Hamor his father, saying, `Take for me this damsel for a wife.'"
1034005,1,34,5,"And Jacob hath heard that he hath defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob kept silent till their coming."
1034006,1,34,6,"And Hamor, father of Shechem, goeth out unto Jacob to speak with him;"
1034007,1,34,7,"and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it `is' very displeasing to them, for folly he hath done against Israel, to lie with the daughter of Jacob -- and so it is not done."
1034008,1,34,8,"And Hamor speaketh with them, saying, `Shechem, my son, his soul hath cleaved to your daughter; give her, I pray you, to him for a wife,"
1034009,1,34,9,"and join ye in marriage with us; your daughters ye give to us, and our daughters ye take to yourselves,"
1034010,1,34,10,"and with us ye dwell, and the land is before you; dwell ye and trade `in' it, and have possessions in it.'"
1034011,1,34,11,"And Shechem saith unto her father, and unto her brethren, `Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which ye say unto me, I give;"
1034012,1,34,12,"multiply on me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I give as ye say unto me, and give to me the young person for a wife.'"
1034013,1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled Dinah their sister),"
1034014,1,34,14,"and say unto them, `We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who hath a foreskin: for it `is' a reproach to us."
1034015,1,34,15,"`Only for this we consent to you; if ye be as we, to have every male of you circumcised,"
1034016,1,34,16,"then we have given our daughters to you, and your daughters we take to ourselves, and we have dwelt with you, and have become one people;"
1034017,1,34,17,"and if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then we have taken our daughter, and have gone.'"
1034018,1,34,18,"And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son;"
1034019,1,34,19,"and the young man delayed not to do the thing, for he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he is honourable above all the house of his father."
1034020,1,34,20,"And Hamor cometh -- Shechem his son also -- unto the gate of their city, and they speak unto the men of their city, saying,"
1034021,1,34,21,"`These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land, and trade `in' it; and the land, lo, `is' wide before them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and our daughters give to them."
1034022,1,34,22,"`Only for this do the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people, in every male of us being circumcised, as they are circumcised;"
1034023,1,34,23,"their cattle, and their substance, and all their beasts -- are they not ours? only let us consent to them, and they dwell with us.'"
1034024,1,34,24,"And unto Hamor, and unto Shechem his son, hearken do all those going out of the gate of his city, and every male is circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city."
1034025,1,34,25,"And it cometh to pass, on the third day, in their being pained, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, take each his sword, and come in against the city confidently, and slay every male;"
1034026,1,34,26,"and Hamor, and Shechem his son, they have slain by the mouth of the sword, and they take Dinah out of Shechem's house, and go out."
1034027,1,34,27,"Jacob's sons have come in upon the wounded, and they spoil the city, because they had defiled their sister;"
1034028,1,34,28,"their flock and their herd, and their asses, and that which `is' in the city, and that which `is' in the field, have they taken;"
1034029,1,34,29,"and all their wealth, and all their infants, and their wives they have taken captive, and they spoil also all that `is' in the house."
1034030,1,34,30,"And Jacob saith unto Simeon and unto Levi, `Ye have troubled me, by causing me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite, and among the Perizzite: and I `am' few in number, and they have been gathered against me, and have smitten me, and I have been destroyed, I and my house.'"
1034031,1,34,31,"And they say, `As a harlot doth he make our sister?'"
1035001,1,35,1,"And God saith unto Jacob, `Rise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared unto thee in thy fleeing from the face of Esau thy brother.'"
1035002,1,35,2,"And Jacob saith unto his household, and unto all who `are' with him, `Turn aside the gods of the stranger which `are' in your midst, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;"
1035003,1,35,3,"and we rise, and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar to God, who is answering me in the day of my distress, and is with me in the way that I have gone.'"
1035004,1,35,4,"And they give unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger that `are' in their hand, and the rings that `are' in their ears, and Jacob hideth them under the oak which `is' by Shechem;"
1035005,1,35,5,"and they journey, and the terror of God is on the cities which `are' round about them, and they have not pursued after the sons of Jacob."
1035006,1,35,6,"And Jacob cometh in to Luz which `is' in the land of Canaan (it `is' Bethel), he and all the people who `are' with him,"
1035007,1,35,7,"and he buildeth there an altar, and proclaimeth at the place the God of Bethel: for there had God been revealed unto him, in his fleeing from the face of his brother."
1035008,1,35,8,"And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, dieth, and she is buried at the lower part of Bethel, under the oak, and he calleth its name `Oak of weeping.'"
1035009,1,35,9,"And God appeareth unto Jacob again, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and blesseth him;"
1035010,1,35,10,"and God saith to him, `Thy name `is' Jacob: thy name is no more called Jacob, but Israel is thy name;' and He calleth his name Israel."
1035011,1,35,11,"And God saith to him, `I `am' God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and an assembly of nations is from thee, and kings from thy loins go out;"
1035012,1,35,12,"and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac -- to thee I give it, yea to thy seed after thee I give the land.'"
1035013,1,35,13,"And God goeth up from him, in the place where He hath spoken with him."
1035014,1,35,14,"And Jacob setteth up a standing pillar in the place where He hath spoken with him, a standing pillar of stone, and he poureth on it an oblation, and he poureth on it oil;"
1035015,1,35,15,and Jacob calleth the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel.
1035016,1,35,16,"And they journey from Bethel, and there is yet a kibrath of land before entering Ephratha, and Rachel beareth, and is sharply pained in her bearing;"
1035017,1,35,17,"and it cometh to pass, in her being sharply pained in her bearing, that the midwife saith to her, `Fear not, for this also `is' a son for thee.'"
1035018,1,35,18,"And it cometh to pass in the going out of her soul (for she died), that she calleth his name Ben-Oni; and his father called him Benjamin;"
1035019,1,35,19,"and Rachel dieth, and is buried in the way to Ephratha, which `is' Bethlehem,"
1035020,1,35,20,and Jacob setteth up a standing pillar over her grave; which `is' the standing pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
1035021,1,35,21,"And Israel journeyeth, and stretcheth out his tent beyond the tower of Edar;"
1035022,1,35,22,"and it cometh to pass in Israel's dwelling in that land, that Reuben goeth, and lieth with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heareth."
1035023,1,35,23,"And the sons of Jacob are twelve. Sons of Leah: Jacob's first-born Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun."
1035024,1,35,24,Sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
1035025,1,35,25,"And sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant: Dan and Naphtali."
1035026,1,35,26,"And sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant: Gad and Asher. These `are' sons of Jacob, who have been born to him in Padan-Aram."
1035027,1,35,27,"And Jacob cometh unto Isaac his father, at Mamre, the city of Arba (which `is' Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac have sojourned."
1035028,1,35,28,"And the days of Isaac are a hundred and eighty years,"
1035029,1,35,29,"and Isaac expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people, aged and satisfied with days; and bury him do Esau and Jacob his sons."
1036001,1,36,1,"And these `are' births of Esau, who `is' Edom."
1036002,1,36,2,"Esau hath taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
1036003,1,36,3,"and Bashemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth."
1036004,1,36,4,"And Adah beareth to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath hath born Reuel;"
1036005,1,36,5,"and Aholibamah hath born Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These `are' sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
1036006,1,36,6,"And Esau taketh his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he hath acquired in the land of Canaan, and goeth into the country from the face of Jacob his brother;"
1036007,1,36,7,"for their substance was more abundant than to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings was not able to bear them because of their cattle;"
1036008,1,36,8,and Esau dwelleth in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
1036009,1,36,9,"And these `are' births of Esau, father of Edom, in mount Seir."
1036010,1,36,10,"These `are' the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz son of Adah, wife of Esau; Reuel son of Bashemath, wife of Esau."

1037003,1,37,3,"And Israel hath loved Joseph more than any of his sons, for he `is' a son of his old age, and hath made for him a long coat;"
1037004,1,37,4,"and his brethren see that their father hath loved him more than any of his brethren, and they hate him, and have not been able to speak `to' him peaceably."

1037012,1,37,12,"And his brethren go to feed the flock of their father in Shechem,"
1037013,1,37,13,"and Israel saith unto Joseph, `Are not thy brethren feeding in Shechem? come, and I send thee unto them;' and he saith to him, `Here `am' I;'"
1037014,1,37,14,"and he saith to him, `Go, I pray thee, see the peace of thy brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me back word;' and he sendeth him from the valley of Hebron, and he cometh to Shechem."
1037015,1,37,15,"And a man findeth him, and lo, he is wandering in the field, and the man asketh him, saying, `What seekest thou?'"
1037016,1,37,16,"and he saith, `My brethren I am seeking, declare to me, I pray thee, where they are feeding?'"
1037017,1,37,17,"And the man saith, `They have journeyed from this, for I have heard some saying, Let us go to Dothan,' and Joseph goeth after his brethren, and findeth them in Dothan."
1037018,1,37,18,"And they see him from afar, even before he draweth near unto them, and they conspire against him to put him to death."
1037019,1,37,19,"And they say one unto another, `Lo, this man of the dreams cometh;"
1037020,1,37,20,"and now, come, and we slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and have said, An evil beast hath devoured him; and we see what his dreams are.'"
1037021,1,37,21,"And Reuben heareth, and delivereth him out of their hand, and saith, `Let us not smite the life;'"
1037022,1,37,22,"and Reuben saith unto them, `Shed no blood; cast him into this pit which `is' in the wilderness, and put not forth a hand upon him,' -- in order to deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back unto his father."
1037023,1,37,23,"And it cometh to pass, when Joseph hath come unto his brethren, that they strip Joseph of his coat, the long coat which `is' upon him,"
1037024,1,37,24,"and take him and cast him into the pit, and the pit `is' empty, there is no water in it."
1037025,1,37,25,"And they sit down to eat bread, and they lift up their eyes, and look, and lo, a company of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels bearing spices, and balm, and myrrh, going to take `them' down to Egypt."
1037026,1,37,26,"And Judah saith unto his brethren, `What gain when we slay our brother, and have concealed his blood?"
1037027,1,37,27,"Come, and we sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hands are not on him, for he `is' our brother -- our flesh;' and his brethren hearken."
1037028,1,37,28,"And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and bring up Joseph out of the pit, and sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silverlings, and they bring Joseph into Egypt."
1037029,1,37,29,"And Reuben returneth unto the pit, and lo, Joseph is not in the pit, and he rendeth his garments,"
1037030,1,37,30,"and he returneth unto his brethren, and saith, `The lad is not, and I -- whither am I going?'"
1037031,1,37,31,"And they take the coat of Joseph, and slaughter a kid of the goats, and dip the coat in the blood,"
1037032,1,37,32,"and send the long coat, and they bring `it' in unto their father, and say, `This have we found; discern, we pray thee, whether it `is' thy son's coat or not?'"
1037033,1,37,33,"And he discerneth it, and saith, `My son's coat! an evil beast hath devoured him; torn -- torn is Joseph!'"
1037034,1,37,34,"And Jacob rendeth his raiment, and putteth sackcloth on his loins, and becometh a mourner for his son many days,"
1037035,1,37,35,"and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort him, and he refuseth to comfort himself, and saith, `For -- I go down mourning unto my son, to Sheol,' and his father weepeth for him."
1037036,1,37,36,"And the Medanites have sold him unto Egypt, to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners."
1038001,1,38,1,"And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Judah goeth down from his brethren, and turneth aside unto a man, an Adullamite, whose name `is' Hirah;"
1038002,1,38,2,"and Judah seeth there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, whose name `is' Shuah, and taketh her, and goeth in unto her."
1038003,1,38,3,"And she conceiveth, and beareth a son, and he calleth his name Er;"
1038004,1,38,4,"and she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Onan;"
1038005,1,38,5,"and she addeth again, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib in her bearing him."
1038006,1,38,6,"And Judah taketh a wife for Er, his first-born, and her name `is' Tamar;"
1038007,1,38,7,"and Er, Judah's first-born, is evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth put him to death."
1038008,1,38,8,"And Judah saith to Onan, `Go in unto the wife of thy brother, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother;'"
1038009,1,38,9,"and Onan knoweth that the seed is not `reckoned' his; and it hath come to pass, if he hath gone in unto his brother's wife, that he hath destroyed `it' to the earth, so as not to give seed to his brother;"
1038010,1,38,10,"and that which he hath done is evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and He putteth him also to death."
1038011,1,38,11,"And Judah saith to Tamar his daughter-in-law, `Abide a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son groweth up;' for he said, `Lest he die -- even he -- like his brethren;' and Tamar goeth and dwelleth at her father's house."
1038012,1,38,12,"And the days are multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, dieth; and Judah is comforted, and goeth up unto his sheep-shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath."
1038013,1,38,13,"And it is declared to Tamar, saying, `Lo, thy husband's father is going up to Timnath to shear his flock;'"
1038014,1,38,14,"and she turneth aside the garments of her widowhood from off her, and covereth herself with a vail, and wrappeth herself up, and sitteth in the opening of Enayim, which `is' by the way to Timnath, for she hath seen that Shelah hath grown up, and she hath not been given to him for a wife."
1038015,1,38,15,"And Judah seeth her, and reckoneth her for a harlot, for she hath covered her face,"
1038016,1,38,16,"and he turneth aside unto her by the way, and saith, `Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee,' (for he hath not known that she `is' his daughter-in-law); and she saith, `What dost thou give to me, that thou mayest come in unto me?'"
1038017,1,38,17,"and he saith, `I -- I send a kid of the goats from the flock.' And she saith, `Dost thou give a pledge till thou send `it'?'"
1038018,1,38,18,"and he saith, `What `is' the pledge that I give to thee?' and she saith, `Thy seal, and thy ribbon, and thy staff which `is' in thy hand;' and he giveth to her, and goeth in unto her, and she conceiveth to him;"
1038019,1,38,19,"and she riseth, and goeth, and turneth aside her vail from off her, and putteth on the garments of her widowhood."
1038020,1,38,20,"And Judah sendeth the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the hand of the woman, and he hath not found her."
1038021,1,38,21,"And he asketh the men of her place, saying, `Where `is' the separated one -- she in Enayim, by the way?' and they say, `There hath not been in this `place' a separated one.'"
1038022,1,38,22,"And he turneth back unto Judah, and saith, `I have not found her; and the men of the place also have said, There hath not been in this `place' a separated one,'"
1038023,1,38,23,"and Judah saith, `Let her take to herself, lest we become despised; lo, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.'"
1038024,1,38,24,"And it cometh to pass about three months `after', that it is declared to Judah, saying, `Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath committed fornication; and also, lo, she hath conceived by fornication:' and Judah saith, `Bring her out -- and she is burnt.'"
1038025,1,38,25,"She is brought out, and she hath sent unto her husband's father, saying, `To a man whose these `are', I `am' pregnant;' and she saith, `Discern, I pray thee, whose `are' these -- the seal, and the ribbons, and the staff.'"
1038026,1,38,26,"And Judah discerneth and saith, `She hath been more righteous than I, because that I did not give her to Shelah my son;' and he hath not added to know her again."
1038027,1,38,27,"And it cometh to pass in the time of her bearing, that lo, twins `are' in her womb;"
1038028,1,38,28,"and it cometh to pass in her bearing, that `one' giveth out a hand, and the midwife taketh and bindeth on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, `This hath come out first.'"
1038029,1,38,29,"And it cometh to pass as he draweth back his hand, that lo, his brother hath come out, and she saith, `What! thou hast broken forth -- on thee `is' the breach;' and he calleth his name Pharez;"
1038030,1,38,30,"and afterwards hath his brother come out, on whose hand `is' the scarlet thread, and he calleth his name Zarah."
1039001,1,39,1,"And Joseph hath been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners, an Egyptian man, buyeth him out of the hands of the Ishmaelites who have brought him thither."
1039002,1,39,2,"And Jehovah is with Joseph, and he is a prosperous man, and he is in the house of his lord the Egyptian,"
1039003,1,39,3,"and his lord seeth that Jehovah is with him, and all that he is doing Jehovah is causing to prosper in his hand,"
1039004,1,39,4,"and Joseph findeth grace in his eyes and serveth him, and he appointeth him over his house, and all that he hath he hath given into his hand."
1039005,1,39,5,"And it cometh to pass from the time that he hath appointed him over his house, and over all that he hath, that Jehovah blesseth the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of Jehovah is on all that he hath, in the house, and in the field;"
1039006,1,39,6,"and he leaveth all that he hath in the hand of Joseph, and he hath not known anything that he hath, except the bread which he is eating. And Joseph is of a fair form, and of a fair appearance."
1039007,1,39,7,"And it cometh to pass after these things, that his lord's wife lifteth up her eyes unto Joseph, and saith, `Lie with me;'"
1039008,1,39,8,"and he refuseth, and saith unto his lord's wife, `Lo, my lord hath not known what `is' with me in the house, and all that he hath he hath given into my hand;"
1039009,1,39,9,"none is greater in this house than I, and he hath not withheld from me anything, except thee, because thou `art' his wife; and how shall I do this great evil? -- then have I sinned against God.'"
1039010,1,39,10,"And it cometh to pass at her speaking unto Joseph day `by' day, that he hath not hearkened unto her, to lie near her, to be with her;"
1039011,1,39,11,"and it cometh to pass about this day, that he goeth into the house to do his work, and there is none of the men of the house there in the house,"
1039012,1,39,12,"and she catcheth him by his garment, saying, `Lie with me;' and he leaveth his garment in her hand, and fleeth, and goeth without."
1039013,1,39,13,"And it cometh to pass when she seeth that he hath left his garment in her hand, and fleeth without,"
1039014,1,39,14,"that she calleth for the men of her house, and speaketh to them, saying, `See, he hath brought in to us a man, a Hebrew, to play with us; he hath come in unto me, to lie with me, and I call with a loud voice,"
1039015,1,39,15,"and it cometh to pass, when he heareth that I have lifted up my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth, and goeth without.'"
1039016,1,39,16,"And she placeth his garment near her, until the coming in of his lord unto his house."
1039017,1,39,17,"And she speaketh unto him according to these words, saying, `The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us, hath come in unto me to play with me;"
1039018,1,39,18,"and it cometh to pass, when I lift my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth without.'"
1039019,1,39,19,"And it cometh to pass when his lord heareth the words of his wife, which she hath spoken unto him, saying, `According to these things hath thy servant done to me,' that his anger burneth;"
1039020,1,39,20,"and Joseph's lord taketh him, and putteth him unto the round-house, a place where the king's prisoners `are' bound; and he is there in the round-house."
1039021,1,39,21,"And Jehovah is with Joseph, and stretcheth out kindness unto him, and putteth his grace in the eyes of the chief of the round-house;"
1039022,1,39,22,"and the chief of the round-house giveth into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who `are' in the round-house, and of all that they are doing there, he hath been doer;"
1039023,1,39,23,"the chief of the round-house seeth not anything under his hand, because Jehovah `is' with him, and that which he is doing Jehovah is causing to prosper."
1040001,1,40,1,"And it cometh to pass, after these things -- the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt;"
1040002,1,40,2,"and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,"
1040003,1,40,3,"and giveth them in charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph `is' a prisoner,"
1040004,1,40,4,"and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge."
1040005,1,40,5,"And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt hath, who `are' prisoners in the round-house."
1040006,1,40,6,"And Joseph cometh in unto them in the morning, and seeth them, and lo, they `are' morose;"
1040007,1,40,7,"and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who `are' with him in charge in the house of his lord, saying, `Wherefore `are' your faces sad to-day?'"
1040008,1,40,8,"And they say unto him, `A dream we have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it;' and Joseph saith unto them, `Are not interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.'"
1040009,1,40,9,"And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to Joseph, and saith to him, `In my dream, then lo, a vine `is' before me!"
1040010,1,40,10,"and in the vine `are' three branches, and it `is' as it were flourishing; gone up hath its blossom, its clusters have ripened grapes;"
1040011,1,40,11,"and Pharaoh's cup `is' in my hand, and I take the grapes and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.'"
1040012,1,40,12,"And Joseph saith to him, `This `is' its interpretation: the three branches are three days;"
1040013,1,40,13,"yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head, and hath put thee back on thy station, and thou hast given the cup of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when thou wast his butler."
1040014,1,40,14,"`Surely if thou hast remembered me with thee, when it is well with thee, and hast done (I pray thee) kindness with me, and hast made mention of me unto Pharaoh, then hast thou brought me out from this house,"
1040015,1,40,15,for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the pit.'
1040016,1,40,16,"And the chief of the bakers seeth that he hath interpreted good, and he saith unto Joseph, `I also `am' in a dream, and lo, three baskets of white bread `are' on my head,"
1040017,1,40,17,"and in the uppermost basket `are' of all `kinds' of Pharaoh's food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them out of the basket, from off my head.'"
1040018,1,40,18,"And Joseph answereth and saith, `This `is' its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;"
1040019,1,40,19,"yet, within three days doth Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and hath hanged thee on a tree, and the birds have eaten thy flesh from off thee.'"
1040020,1,40,20,"And it cometh to pass, on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he maketh a banquet to all his servants, and lifteth up the head of the chief of the butlers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants,"
1040021,1,40,21,"and he putteth back the chief of the butlers to his butlership, and he giveth the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;"
1040022,1,40,22,"and the chief of the bakers he hath hanged, as Joseph hath interpreted to them;"
1040023,1,40,23,"and the chief of the butlers hath not remembered Joseph, but forgetteth him."
1041001,1,41,1,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of two years of days that Pharaoh is dreaming, and lo, he is standing by the River,"
1041002,1,41,2,"and lo, from the River coming up are seven kine, of fair appearance, and fat `in' flesh, and they feed among the reeds;"
1041003,1,41,3,"and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them out of the River, of bad appearance, and lean `in' flesh, and they stand near the kine on the edge of the River,"
1041004,1,41,4,"and the kine of bad appearance and lean `in' flesh eat up the seven kine of fair appearance, and fat -- and Pharaoh awaketh."
1041005,1,41,5,"And he sleepeth, and dreameth a second time, and lo, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, fat and good,"
1041006,1,41,6,"and lo, seven ears, thin, and blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;"
1041007,1,41,7,"and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears -- and Pharaoh awaketh, and lo, a dream."
1041008,1,41,8,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that his spirit is moved, and he sendeth and calleth all the scribes of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh recounteth to them his dream, and there is no interpreter of them to Pharaoh."
1041009,1,41,9,"And the chief of the butlers speaketh with Pharaoh, saying, `My sin I mention this day:"
1041010,1,41,10,"Pharaoh hath been wroth against his servants, and giveth me into charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, me and the chief of the bakers;"
1041011,1,41,11,"and we dream a dream in one night, I and he, each according to the interpretation of his dream we have dreamed."
1041012,1,41,12,"And there `is' with us a youth, a Hebrew, servant to the chief of the executioners, and we recount to him, and he interpreteth to us our dreams, `to' each according to his dream hath he interpreted,"
1041013,1,41,13,"and it cometh to pass, as he hath interpreted to us so it hath been, me he put back on my station, and him he hanged.'"
1041014,1,41,14,"And Pharaoh sendeth and calleth Joseph, and they cause him to run out of the pit, and he shaveth, and changeth his garments, and cometh in unto Pharaoh."
1041015,1,41,15,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `A dream I have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it, and I -- I have heard concerning thee, saying, Thou understandest a dream to interpret it,'"
1041016,1,41,16,"and Joseph answereth Pharaoh, saying, `Without me -- God doth answer Pharaoh with peace.'"
1041017,1,41,17,"And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph: `In my dream, lo, I am standing by the edge of the River,"
1041018,1,41,18,"and lo, out of the River coming up are seven kine, fat `in' flesh, and of fair form, and they feed among the reeds;"
1041019,1,41,19,"and lo, seven other kine are coming up after them, thin, and of very bad form, and lean `in' flesh; I have not seen like these in all the land of Egypt for badness."
1041020,1,41,20,"`And the lean and the bad kine eat up the first seven fat kine,"
1041021,1,41,21,"and they come in unto their midst, and it hath not been known that they have come in unto their midst, and their appearance `is' bad as at the commencement; and I awake."
1041022,1,41,22,"`And I see in my dream, and lo, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, full and good;"
1041023,1,41,23,"and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;"
1041024,1,41,24,"and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell unto the scribes, and there is none declaring to me.'"
1041025,1,41,25,"And Joseph saith unto Pharaoh, `The dream of Pharaoh is one: that which God is doing he hath declared to Pharaoh;"
1041026,1,41,26,"the seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years, the dream is one;"
1041027,1,41,27,"and the seven thin and bad kine which are coming up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears, blasted with an east wind, are seven years of famine;"
1041028,1,41,28,"this `is' the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: That which God is doing, he hath shewn Pharaoh."
1041029,1,41,29,"`Lo, seven years are coming of great abundance in all the land of Egypt,"
1041030,1,41,30,"and seven years of famine have arisen after them, and all the plenty is forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine hath finished the land,"
1041031,1,41,31,"and the plenty is not known in the land because of that famine afterwards, for it `is' very grievous."
1041032,1,41,32,"`And because of the repeating of the dream unto Pharaoh twice, surely the thing is established by God, and God is hastening to do it."
1041033,1,41,33,"`And now, let Pharaoh provide a man, intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt;"
1041034,1,41,34,"let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, and receive a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty,"
1041035,1,41,35,"and they gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh -- food in the cities; and they have kept `it',"
1041036,1,41,36,"and the food hath been for a store for the land, for the seven years of famine which are in the land of Egypt; and the land is cut off by the famine.'"
1041037,1,41,37,"And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants,"
1041038,1,41,38,"and Pharaoh saith unto his servants, `Do we find like this, a man in whom the spirit of God `is'?'"
1041039,1,41,39,"and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `After God's causing thee to know all this, there is none intelligent and wise as thou;"
1041040,1,41,40,"thou -- thou art over my house, and at thy mouth do all my people kiss; only in the throne I am greater than thou.'"
1041041,1,41,41,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `See, I have put thee over all the land of Egypt.'"
1041042,1,41,42,"And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand, and putteth it on the hand of Joseph, and clotheth him `with' garments of fine linen, and placeth a chain of gold on his neck,"
1041043,1,41,43,"and causeth him to ride in the second chariot which he hath, and they proclaim before him, `Bow the knee!' and -- to put him over all the land of Egypt."
1041044,1,41,44,"And Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `I `am' Pharaoh, and without thee a man doth not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt;'"
1041045,1,41,45,"and Pharaoh calleth Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he giveth to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, for a wife, and Joseph goeth out over the land of Egypt."
1041046,1,41,46,"And Joseph `is' a son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph goeth out from the presence of Pharaoh, and passeth over through all the land of Egypt;"
1041047,1,41,47,and the land maketh in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
1041048,1,41,48,"And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which have been in the land of Egypt, and putteth food in the cities; the food of the field which `is' round about `each' city hath he put in its midst;"
1041049,1,41,49,"and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea, multiplying exceedingly, until that he hath ceased to number, for there is no number."
1041050,1,41,50,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine cometh, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, hath borne to him,"
1041051,1,41,51,"and Joseph calleth the name of the first-born Manasseh: `for, God hath made me to forget all my labour, and all the house of my father;'"
1041052,1,41,52,"and the name of the second he hath called Ephraim: `for, God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of mine affliction.'"
1041053,1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenty are completed which have been in the land of Egypt,"
1041054,1,41,54,"and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt hath been bread;"
1041055,1,41,55,"and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people crieth unto Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh saith to all the Egyptians, `Go unto Joseph; that which he saith to you -- do.'"
1041056,1,41,56,"And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and Joseph openeth all `places' which have `corn' in them, and selleth to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land of Egypt,"
1041057,1,41,57,"and all the earth hath come to Egypt, to buy, unto Joseph, for the famine was severe in all the earth."
1042001,1,42,1,"And Jacob seeth that there is corn in Egypt, and Jacob saith to his sons, `Why do you look at each other?'"
1042002,1,42,2,"he saith also, `Lo, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt, go down thither, and buy for us from thence, and we live and do not die;'"
1042003,1,42,3,"and the ten brethren of Joseph go down to buy corn in Egypt,"
1042004,1,42,4,"and Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob hath not sent with his brethren, for he said, `Lest mischief meet him.'"
1042005,1,42,5,"And the sons of Israel come to buy in the midst of those coming, for the famine hath been in the land of Canaan,"
1042006,1,42,6,"and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to all the people of the land, and Joseph's brethren come and bow themselves to him -- face to the earth."
1042007,1,42,7,"And Joseph seeth his brethren, and discerneth them, and maketh himself strange unto them, and speaketh with them sharp things, and saith unto them, `From whence have ye come?' and they say, `From the land of Canaan -- to buy food.'"
1042008,1,42,8,"And Joseph discerneth his brethren, but they have not discerned him,"
1042009,1,42,9,"and Joseph remembereth the dreams which he dreamed of them, and saith unto them, `Ye `are' spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye have come.'"
1042010,1,42,10,"And they say unto him, `No, my lord, but thy servants have come to buy food;"
1042011,1,42,11,"we `are' all of us sons of one man, we `are' right men; thy servants have not been spies;'"
1042012,1,42,12,"and he saith unto them, `No, but the nakedness of the land ye have come to see;'"
1042013,1,42,13,"and they say, `Thy servants `are' twelve brethren; we `are' sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and lo, the young one `is' with our father to-day, and the one is not.'"
1042014,1,42,14,"And Joseph saith unto them, `This `is' that which I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye `are' spies,"
1042015,1,42,15,by this ye are proved: Pharaoh liveth! if ye go out from this -- except by your young brother coming hither;
1042016,1,42,16,"send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye, remain ye bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be with you: and if not -- Pharaoh liveth! surely ye `are' spies;'"
1042017,1,42,17,and he removeth them unto charge three days.
1042018,1,42,18,"And Joseph saith unto them on the third day, `This do and live; God I fear!"
1042019,1,42,19,"if ye `are' right men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your ward, and ye, go, carry in corn `for' the famine of your houses,"
1042020,1,42,20,"and your young brother ye bring unto me, and your words are established, and ye die not;' and they do so."
1042021,1,42,21,"And they say one unto another, `Verily we `are' guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul, in his making supplication unto us, and we did not hearken: therefore hath this distress come upon us.'"
1042022,1,42,22,"And Reuben answereth them, saying, `Spake I not unto you, saying, Sin not against the lad? and ye hearkened not; and his blood also, lo, it is required.'"
1042023,1,42,23,"And they have not known that Joseph understandeth, for the interpreter `is' between them;"
1042024,1,42,24,"and he turneth round from them, and weepeth, and turneth back unto them, and speaketh unto them, and taketh from them Simeon, and bindeth him before their eyes."
1042025,1,42,25,"And Joseph commandeth, and they fill their vessels `with' corn, also to put back the money of each unto his sack, and to give to them provision for the way; and one doth to them so."
1042026,1,42,26,"And they lift up their corn upon their asses, and go from thence,"
1042027,1,42,27,"and the one openeth his sack to give provender to his ass at a lodging-place, and he seeth his money, and lo, it `is' in the mouth of his bag,"
1042028,1,42,28,"and he saith unto his brethren, `My money hath been put back, and also, lo, in my bag:' and their heart goeth out, and they tremble, one to another saying, `What `is' this God hath done to us!'"
1042029,1,42,29,"And they come in unto Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them, saying,"
1042030,1,42,30,"`The man, the lord of the land, hath spoken with us sharp things, and maketh us as spies of the land;"
1042031,1,42,31,"and we say unto him, We `are' right men, we have not been spies,"
1042032,1,42,32,"we `are' twelve brethren, sons of our father, the one is not, and the young one `is' to-day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1042033,1,42,33,"`And the man, the lord of the land, saith unto us, By this I know that ye `are' right men -- one of your brethren leave with me, and `for' the famine of your houses take ye and go,"
1042034,1,42,34,"and bring your young brother unto me, and I know that ye `are' not spies, but ye `are' right men; your brother I give to you, and ye trade with the land.'"
1042035,1,42,35,"And it cometh to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and lo, the bundle of each man's silver `is' in his sack, and they see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are afraid;"
1042036,1,42,36,"and Jacob their father saith unto them, `Me ye have bereaved; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin ye take -- against me have been all these.'"
1042037,1,42,37,"And Reuben speaketh unto his father, saying, `My two sons thou dost put to death, if I bring him not in unto thee; give him into my hand, and I -- I bring him back unto thee;'"
1042038,1,42,38,"and he saith, `My son doth not go down with you, for his brother `is' dead, and he by himself is left; when mischief hath met him in the way in which ye go, then ye have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to sheol.'"
1043001,1,43,1,And the famine `is' severe in the land;
1043002,1,43,2,"and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'"
1043003,1,43,3,"And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you;"
1043004,1,43,4,"if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for thee food,"
1043005,1,43,5,"and if thou art not sending -- we do not go down, for the man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you.'"
1043006,1,43,6,"And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to the man that ye had yet a brother?'"
1043007,1,43,7,"and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?'"
1043008,1,43,8,"And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and thou, and our infants."
1043009,1,43,9,"I -- I am surety `for' him, from my hand thou dost require him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before thee -- then I have sinned against thee all the days;"
1043010,1,43,10,"for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.'"
1043011,1,43,11,"And Israel their father saith unto them, `If so, now, this do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;"
1043012,1,43,12,"and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, ye take back in your hand, it may be it `is' an oversight."
1043013,1,43,13,"`And take your brother, and rise, turn back unto the man;"
1043014,1,43,14,"and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he hath sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved -- I am bereaved.'"
1043015,1,43,15,"And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;"
1043016,1,43,16,"and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them, and saith to him who `is' over his house, `Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat at noon.'"
1043017,1,43,17,"And the man doth as Joseph hath said, and the man bringeth in the men into the house of Joseph,"
1043018,1,43,18,"and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, `For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in -- to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants -- our asses also.'"
1043019,1,43,19,"And they come nigh unto the man who `is' over the house of Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,"
1043020,1,43,20,"and say, `O, my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;"
1043021,1,43,21,"and it cometh to pass, when we have come in unto the lodging-place, and open our bags, that lo, each one's money `is' in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;"
1043022,1,43,22,and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'
1043023,1,43,23,"And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto them."
1043024,1,43,24,"And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house, and giveth water, and they wash their feet; and he giveth provender for their asses,"
1043025,1,43,25,"and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread."
1043026,1,43,26,"And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him the present which `is' in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;"
1043027,1,43,27,"and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'"
1043028,1,43,28,"and they say, `Thy servant our father `is' well, he is yet alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance."
1043029,1,43,29,"And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God favour thee, my son.'"
1043030,1,43,30,"And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner chamber, and weepeth there;"
1043031,1,43,31,"and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth himself, and saith, `Place bread.'"
1043032,1,43,32,"And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it `is' an abomination to the Egyptians."
1043033,1,43,33,"And they sit before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;"
1043034,1,43,34,"and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him."
1044001,1,44,1,"And he commandeth him who `is' over his house, saying, `Fill the bags of the men `with' food, as they are able to bear, and put the money of each in the mouth of his bag;"
1044002,1,44,2,"and my cup, the silver cup, thou dost put in the mouth of the bag of the young one, and his corn-money;' and he doth according to the word of Joseph which he hath spoken."
1044003,1,44,3,"The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away, they and their asses --"
1044004,1,44,4,"they have gone out of the city -- they have not gone far off -- and Joseph hath said to him who `is' over his house, `Rise, pursue after the men; and thou hast overtaken them, and thou hast said unto them, Why have ye recompensed evil for good?"
1044005,1,44,5,Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he observeth diligently with it; ye have done evil `in' that which ye have done.'
1044006,1,44,6,"And he overtaketh them, and speaketh unto them these words,"
1044007,1,44,7,"and they say unto him, `Why doth my lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to this word;"
1044008,1,44,8,"lo, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back unto thee from the land of Canaan, and how do we steal from the house of thy lord silver or gold?"
1044009,1,44,9,"with whomsoever of thy servants it is found, he hath died, and we also are to my lord for servants.'"
1044010,1,44,10,"And he saith, `Now, also, according to your words, so it `is'; he with whom it is found becometh my servant, and ye are acquitted;'"
1044011,1,44,11,"and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth, and each openeth his bag;"
1044012,1,44,12,"and he searcheth -- at the eldest he hath begun, and at the youngest he hath completed -- and the cup is found in the bag of Benjamin;"
1044013,1,44,13,"and they rend their garments, and each ladeth his ass, and they turn back to the city."
1044014,1,44,14,"And Judah -- his brethren also -- cometh in unto the house of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall before him to the earth;"
1044015,1,44,15,"and Joseph saith to them, `What `is' this deed that ye have done? have ye not known that a man like me doth diligently observe?'"
1044016,1,44,16,"And Judah saith, `What do we say to my lord? what do we speak? and what -- do we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; lo, we `are' servants to my lord, both we, and he in whose hand the cup hath been found;'"
1044017,1,44,17,"and he saith, `Far be it from me to do this; the man in whose hand the cup hath been found, he becometh my servant; and ye, go ye up in peace unto your father.'"
1044018,1,44,18,"And Judah cometh nigh unto him, and saith, `O, my lord, let thy servant speak, I pray thee, a word in the ears of my lord, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant -- for thou art as Pharaoh."
1044019,1,44,19,"My lord hath asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father or brother?"
1044020,1,44,20,"and we say unto my lord, We have a father, an aged one, and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and he is left alone of his mother, and his father hath loved him."
1044021,1,44,21,"`And thou sayest unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, and I set mine eye upon him;"
1044022,1,44,22,"and we say unto my lord, The youth is not able to leave his father, when he hath left his father, then he hath died;"
1044023,1,44,23,"and thou sayest unto thy servants, If your young brother come not down with you, ye add not to see my face."
1044024,1,44,24,"`And it cometh to pass, that we have come up unto thy servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord;"
1044025,1,44,25,"and our father saith, Turn back, buy for us a little food,"
1044026,1,44,26,"and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able to see the man's face, and our young brother not with us."
1044027,1,44,27,"`And thy servant my father saith unto us, Ye -- ye have known that two did my wife bare to me,"
1044028,1,44,28,"and the one goeth out from me, and I say, Surely he is torn -- torn! and I have not seen him since;"
1044029,1,44,29,"when ye have taken also this from my presence, and mischief hath met him, then ye have brought down my grey hairs with evil to sheol."
1044030,1,44,30,"`And now, at my coming in unto thy servant my father, and the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),"
1044031,1,44,31,"then it hath come to pass when he seeth that the youth is not, that he hath died, and thy servants have brought down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to sheol;"
1044032,1,44,32,"for thy servant obtained the youth by surety from my father, saying, If I bring him not in unto thee -- then I have sinned against my father all the days."
1044033,1,44,33,"`And now, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the youth a servant to my lord, and the youth goeth up with his brethren,"
1044034,1,44,34,"for how do I go up unto my father, and the youth not with me? lest I look on the evil which doth find my father.'"
1045001,1,45,1,"And Joseph hath not been able to refrain himself before all those standing by him, and he calleth, `Put out every man from me;' and no man hath stood with him when Joseph maketh himself known unto his brethren,"
1045002,1,45,2,"and he giveth forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians hear, and the house of Pharaoh heareth."
1045003,1,45,3,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `I `am' Joseph, is my father yet alive?' and his brethren have not been able to answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence."
1045004,1,45,4,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `Come nigh unto me, I pray you,' and they come nigh; and he saith, `I `am' Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt;"
1045005,1,45,5,"and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your eyes that ye sold me hither, for to preserve life hath God sent me before you."
1045006,1,45,6,"`Because these two years the famine `is' in the heart of the land, and yet `are' five years, `in' which there is neither ploughing nor harvest;"
1045007,1,45,7,"and God sendeth me before you, to place of you a remnant in the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;"
1045008,1,45,8,"and now, ye -- ye have not sent me hither, but God, and He doth set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1045009,1,45,9,"`Haste, and go up unto my father, then ye have said to him, Thus said Joseph thy son, God hath set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, stay not,"
1045010,1,45,10,"and thou hast dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near unto me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, and thy flock, and thy herd, and all that thou hast,"
1045011,1,45,11,"and I have nourished thee there -- for yet `are' five years of famine -- lest thou become poor, thou and thy household, and all that thou hast."
1045012,1,45,12,"`And lo, your eyes are seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that `it is' my mouth which is speaking unto you;"
1045013,1,45,13,"and ye have declared to my father all my honour in Egypt, and all that ye have seen, and ye have hasted, and have brought down my father hither.'"
1045014,1,45,14,"And he falleth on the neck of Benjamin his brother, and weepeth, and Benjamin hath wept on his neck;"
1045015,1,45,15,"and he kisseth all his brethren, and weepeth over them; and afterwards have his brethren spoken with him."
1045016,1,45,16,"And the sound hath been heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, `Come have the brethren of Joseph;' and it is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,"
1045017,1,45,17,"and Pharaoh saith unto Joseph, `Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, enter ye the land of Canaan,"
1045018,1,45,18,"and take your father, and your households, and come unto me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat ye the fat of the land."
1045019,1,45,19,"`Yea, thou -- thou hast been commanded: this do ye, take for yourselves out of the land of Egypt, waggons for your infants, and for your wives, and ye have brought your father, and come;"
1045020,1,45,20,"and your eye hath no pity on your vessels, for the good of all the land of Egypt `is' yours.'"
1045021,1,45,21,"And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph giveth waggons to them by the command of Pharaoh, and he giveth to them provision for the way;"
1045022,1,45,22,"to all of them hath he given -- to each changes of garments, and to Benjamin he hath given three hundred silverlings, and five changes of garments;"
1045023,1,45,23,"and to his father he hath sent thus: ten asses bearing of the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and bread, even food for his father for the way."
1045024,1,45,24,"And he sendeth his brethren away, and they go; and he saith unto them, `Be not angry in the way.'"
1045025,1,45,25,"And they go up out of Egypt, and come in to the land of Canaan, unto Jacob their father,"
1045026,1,45,26,"and they declare to him, saying, `Joseph `is' yet alive,' and that he `is' ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his heart ceaseth, for he hath not given credence to them."
1045027,1,45,27,"And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he hath spoken unto them, and he seeth the waggons which Joseph hath sent to bear him away, and live doth the spirit of Jacob their father;"
1045028,1,45,28,"and Israel saith, `Enough! Joseph my son `is' yet alive; I go and see him before I die.'"
1046001,1,46,1,"And Israel journeyeth, and all that he hath, and cometh in to Beer-Sheba, and sacrificeth sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac;"
1046002,1,46,2,"and God speaketh to Israel in visions of the night, and saith, `Jacob, Jacob;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
1046003,1,46,3,"And He saith, `I `am' God, God of thy father, be not afraid of going down to Egypt, for for a great nation I set thee there;"
1046004,1,46,4,"I -- I go down with thee to Egypt, and I -- I also certainly bring thee up, and Joseph doth put his hand on thine eyes.'"
1046005,1,46,5,"And Jacob riseth from Beer-Sheba, and the sons of Israel bear away Jacob their father, And their infants, and their wives, in the waggons which Pharaoh hath sent to bear him,"
1046006,1,46,6,"and they take their cattle, and their goods which they have acquired in the land of Canaan, and come into Egypt -- Jacob, and all his seed with him,"
1046007,1,46,7,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, yea, all his seed he brought with him into Egypt."
1046008,1,46,8,"And these `are' the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt: Jacob and his sons, Jacob's first-born, Reuben."
1046009,1,46,9,"And sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1046010,1,46,10,"And sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul son of the Canaanitess."
1046011,1,46,11,"And sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1046012,1,46,12,"And sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah, (and Er and Onan die in the land of Canaan.) And sons of Pharez are Hezron and Hamul."
1046013,1,46,13,"And sons of Issachar: Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."

1046028,1,46,28,"And Judah he hath sent before him unto Joseph, to direct before him to Goshen, and they come into the land of Goshen;"
1046029,1,46,29,"and Joseph harnesseth his chariot, and goeth up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and appeareth unto him, and falleth on his neck, and weepeth on his neck again;"
1046030,1,46,30,"and Israel saith unto Joseph, `Let me die this time, after my seeing thy face, for thou `art' yet alive.'"
1046031,1,46,31,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, and unto the house of his father, `I go up, and declare to Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and the house of my father who `are' in the land of Canaan have come in unto me;"
1046032,1,46,32,"and the men `are' feeders of a flock, for they have been men of cattle; and their flock, and their herd, and all that they have, they have brought.'"
1046033,1,46,33,"`And it hath come to pass when Pharaoh calleth for you, and hath said, What `are' your works?"
1046034,1,46,34,"that ye have said, Thy servants have been men of cattle from our youth, even until now, both we and our fathers, -- in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the abomination of the Egyptians is every one feeding a flock.'"
1047001,1,47,1,"And Joseph cometh, and declareth to Pharaoh, and saith, `My father, and my brethren, and their flock, and their herd, and all they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and lo, they `are' in the land of Goshen.'"
1047002,1,47,2,"And out of his brethren he hath taken five men, and setteth them before Pharaoh;"
1047003,1,47,3,"and Pharaoh saith unto his brethren, `What `are' your works?' and they say unto Pharaoh, `Thy servants `are' feeders of a flock, both we and our fathers;'"
1047004,1,47,4,"and they say unto Pharaoh, `To sojourn in the land we have come, for there is no pasture for the flock which thy servants have, for grievous `is' the famine in the land of Canaan; and now, let thy servants, we pray thee, dwell in the land of Goshen.'"
1047005,1,47,5,"And Pharaoh speaketh unto Joseph, saying, `Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee:"
1047006,1,47,6,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land cause thy father and thy brethren to dwell -- they dwell in the land of Goshen, and if thou hast known, and there are among them men of ability, then thou hast set them heads over the cattle I have.'"
1047007,1,47,7,"And Joseph bringeth in Jacob his father, and causeth him to stand before Pharaoh; and Jacob blesseth Pharaoh."
1047008,1,47,8,"And Pharaoh saith unto Jacob, `How many `are' the days of the years of thy life?'"
1047009,1,47,9,"And Jacob saith unto Pharaoh, `The days of the years of my sojournings `are' an hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings.'"
1047010,1,47,10,"And Jacob blesseth Pharaoh, and goeth out from before Pharaoh."
1047011,1,47,11,"And Joseph settleth his father and his brethren, and giveth to them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded;"
1047012,1,47,12,"and Joseph nourisheth his father, and his brethren, and all the house of his father `with' bread, according to the mouth of the infants."
1047013,1,47,13,"And there is no bread in all the land, for the famine `is' very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan are feeble because of the famine;"
1047014,1,47,14,"and Joseph gathereth all the silver that is found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn that they are buying, and Joseph bringeth the silver into the house of Pharaoh."
1047015,1,47,15,"And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians come in unto Joseph, saying, `Give to us bread -- why do we die before thee, though the money hath ceased?'"
1047016,1,47,16,"and Joseph saith, `Give your cattle; and I give to you for your cattle, if the money hath ceased.'"
1047017,1,47,17,"And they bring in their cattle unto Joseph, and Joseph giveth to them bread, for the horses, and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd, and for the asses; and he tendeth them with bread, for all their cattle, during that year."
1047018,1,47,18,"And that year is finished, and they come in unto him on the second year, and say to him, `We do not hide from my lord, that since the money hath been finished, and possession of the cattle `is' unto my lord, there hath not been left before my lord save our bodies, and our ground;"
1047019,1,47,19,"why do we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, and we and our ground are servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, and we live, and die not, and the ground is not desolate.'"
1047020,1,47,20,"And Joseph buyeth all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians have sold each his field, for the famine hath been severe upon them, and the land becometh Pharaoh's;"
1047021,1,47,21,as to the people he hath removed them to cities from the `one' end of the border of Egypt even unto its `other' end.
1047022,1,47,22,"Only the ground of the priests he hath not bought, for the priests have a portion from Pharaoh, and they have eaten their portion which Pharaoh hath given to them, therefore they have not sold their ground."
1047023,1,47,23,"And Joseph saith unto the people, `Lo, I have bought you to-day and your ground for Pharaoh; lo, seed for you, and ye have sown the ground,"
1047024,1,47,24,"and it hath come to pass in the increases, that ye have given a fifth to Pharaoh, and four of the parts are for yourselves, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those who `are' in your houses, and for food for your infants.'"
1047025,1,47,25,"And they say, `Thou hast revived us; we find grace in the eyes of my lord, and have been servants to Pharaoh;'"
1047026,1,47,26,"and Joseph setteth it for a statute unto this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, `that' Pharaoh hath a fifth; only the ground of the priests alone hath not become Pharaoh's."
1047027,1,47,27,"And Israel dwelleth in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they have possession in it, and are fruitful, and multiply exceedingly;"
1047028,1,47,28,"and Jacob liveth in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, are an hundred and forty and seven years."
1047029,1,47,29,"And the days of Israel are near to die, and he calleth for his son, for Joseph, and saith to him, `If, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and thou hast done with me kindness and truth; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt,"
1047030,1,47,30,"and I have lain with my fathers, and thou hast borne me out of Egypt, and buried me in their burying-place.' And he saith, `I -- I do according to thy word;'"
1047031,1,47,31,"and he saith, `Swear to me;' and he sweareth to him, and Israel boweth himself on the head of the bed."
1048001,1,48,1,"And it cometh to pass, after these things, that `one' saith to Joseph, `Lo, thy father is sick;' and he taketh his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1048002,1,48,2,"And `one' declareth to Jacob, and saith, `Lo, thy son Joseph is coming unto thee;' and Israel doth strengthen himself, and sit upon the bed."
1048003,1,48,3,"And Jacob saith unto Joseph, `God Almighty hath appeared unto me, in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blesseth me,"
1048004,1,48,4,"and saith unto me, Lo, I am making thee fruitful, and have multiplied thee, and given thee for an assembly of peoples, and given this land to thy seed after thee, a possession age-during."
1048005,1,48,5,"`And now, thy two sons, who are born to thee in the land of Egypt, before my coming unto thee to Egypt, mine they `are'; Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon they are mine;"
1048006,1,48,6,and thy family which thou hast begotten after them are thine; by the name of their brethren they are called in their inheritance.
1048007,1,48,7,"`And I -- in my coming in from Padan-`Aram' Rachel hath died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, while yet a kibrath of land to enter Ephrata, and I bury her there in the way of Ephrata, which `is' Bethlehem.'"
1048008,1,48,8,"And Israel seeth the sons of Joseph, and saith, `Who `are' these?'"
1048009,1,48,9,"and Joseph saith unto his father, `They `are' my sons, whom God hath given to me in this `place';' and he saith, `Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I bless them.'"
1048010,1,48,10,"And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age, he is unable to see; and he bringeth them nigh unto him, and he kisseth them, and cleaveth to them;"
1048011,1,48,11,"and Israel saith unto Joseph, `To see thy face I had not thought, and lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.'"
1048012,1,48,12,"And Joseph bringeth them out from between his knees, and boweth himself on his face to the earth;"
1048013,1,48,13,"and Joseph taketh them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left, and Manasseh in his left towards Israel's right, and bringeth `them' nigh to him."
1048014,1,48,14,"And Israel putteth out his right hand, and placeth `it' upon the head of Ephraim, who `is' the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh; he hath guided his hands wisely, for Manasseh `is' the first-born."
1048015,1,48,15,"And he blesseth Joseph, and saith, `God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked habitually: God who is feeding me from my being unto this day:"
1048016,1,48,16,"the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil doth bless the youths, and my name is called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and they increase into a multitude in the midst of the land.'"
1048017,1,48,17,"And Joseph seeth that his father setteth his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he supporteth the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;"
1048018,1,48,18,"and Joseph saith unto his father, `Not so, my father, for this `is' the first-born; set thy right hand on his head.'"
1048019,1,48,19,"And his father refuseth, and saith, `I have known, my son, I have known; he also becometh a people, and he also is great, and yet, his young brother is greater than he, and his seed is the fulness of the nations;'"
1048020,1,48,20,"and he blesseth them in that day, saying, `By thee doth Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh;' and he setteth Ephraim before Manasseh."
1048021,1,48,21,"And Israel saith unto Joseph, `Lo, I am dying, and God hath been with you, and hath brought you back unto the land of your fathers;"
1048022,1,48,22,"and I -- I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I have taken out of the hand of the Amorite by my sword and by my bow.'"
1049001,1,49,1,"And Jacob calleth unto his sons and saith, `Be gathered together, and I declare to you that which doth happen with you in the latter end of the days."
1049002,1,49,2,"`Be assembled, and hear, sons of Jacob, And hearken unto Israel your father."
1049003,1,49,3,"Reuben! my first-born thou, My power, and beginning of my strength, The abundance of exaltation, And the abundance of strength;"
1049004,1,49,4,"Unstable as water, thou art not abundant; For thou hast gone up thy father's bed; Then thou hast polluted: My couch he went up!"
1049005,1,49,5,Simeon and Levi `are' brethren! Instruments of violence -- their espousals!
1049006,1,49,6,"Into their secret, come not, O my soul! Unto their assembly be not united, O mine honour; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will eradicated a prince."
1049007,1,49,7,"Cursed `is' their anger, for `it is' fierce, And their wrath, for `it is' sharp; I divide them in Jacob, And I scatter them in Israel."
1049008,1,49,8,"Judah! thou -- thy brethren praise thee! Thy hand `is' on the neck of thine enemies, Sons of thy father bow themselves to thee."
1049009,1,49,9,"A lion's whelp `is' Judah, For prey, my son, thou hast gone up; He hath bent, he hath crouched as a lion, And as a lioness; who causeth him to arise?"
1049010,1,49,10,"The sceptre turneth not aside from Judah, And a lawgiver from between his feet, Till his Seed come; And his `is' the obedience of peoples."
1049011,1,49,11,"Binding to the vine his ass, And to the choice vine the colt of his ass, He hath washed in wine his clothing, And in the blood of grapes his covering;"
1049012,1,49,12,"Red `are' eyes with wine, And white `are' teeth with milk!"
1049013,1,49,13,"Zebulun at a haven of the seas doth dwell, And he `is' for a haven of ships; And his side `is' unto Zidon."
1049014,1,49,14,"Issacher `is' a strong ass, Crouching between the two folds;"
1049015,1,49,15,"And he seeth rest that `it is' good, And the land that `it is' pleasant, And he inclineth his shoulder to bear, And is to tribute a servant."
1049016,1,49,16,"Dan doth judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel;"
1049017,1,49,17,"Dan is a serpent by the way, An adder by the path, Which is biting the horse's heels, And its rider falleth backward."
1049018,1,49,18,"For Thy salvation I have waited, Jehovah!"
1049019,1,49,19,"Gad! a troop assaulteth him, But he assaulteth last."
1049020,1,49,20,Out of Asher his bread `is' fat; And he giveth dainties of a king.
1049021,1,49,21,"Naphtali `is' a hind sent away, Who is giving beauteous young ones."
1049022,1,49,22,"Joseph `is' a fruitful son; A fruitful son by a fountain, Daughters step over the wall;"
1049023,1,49,23,"And embitter him -- yea, they have striven, Yea, hate him do archers;"
1049024,1,49,24,"And his bow abideth in strength, And strengthened are the arms of his hands By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, Whence is a shepherd, a son of Israel."
1049025,1,49,25,"By the God of thy father who helpeth thee, And the Mighty One who blesseth thee, Blessings of the heavens from above, Blessings of the deep lying under, Blessings of breasts and womb; --"
1049026,1,49,26,"Thy father's blessings have been mighty Above the blessings of my progenitors, Unto the limit of the heights age-during They are for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of the one Separate `from' his brethren."
1049027,1,49,27,"Benjamin! a wolf teareth; In the morning he eateth prey, And at evening he apportioneth spoil.'"
1049028,1,49,28,"All these `are' the twelve tribes of Israel, and this `is' that which their father hath spoken unto them, and he blesseth them; each according to his blessing he hath blessed them."
1049029,1,49,29,"And he commandeth them, and saith unto them, `I am being gathered unto my people; bury me by my fathers, at the cave which `is' in the field of Ephron the Hittite;"
1049030,1,49,30,"in the cave which `is' in the field of Machpelah, which `is' on the front of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place;"
1049031,1,49,31,(there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah);
1049032,1,49,32,"the purchase of the field and of the cave which `is' in it, `is' from Sons of Heth.'"
1049033,1,49,33,"And Jacob finisheth commanding his sons, and gathereth up his feet unto the bed, and expireth, and is gathered unto his people."
1050001,1,50,1,"And Joseph falleth on his father's face, and weepeth over him, and kisseth him;"
1050002,1,50,2,"and Joseph commandeth his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father, and the physicians embalm Israel;"
1050003,1,50,3,"and they fulfil for him forty days, for so they fulfil the days of the embalmed, and the Egyptians weep for him seventy days."
1050004,1,50,4,"And the days of his weeping pass away, and Joseph speaketh unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, `If, I pray you, I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1050005,1,50,5,"My father caused me to swear, saying, Lo, I am dying; in my burying-place which I have prepared for myself in the land of Canaan, there dost thou bury me; and now, let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and return;'"
1050006,1,50,6,"and Pharaoh saith, `Go up and bury thy father, as he caused thee to swear.'"
1050007,1,50,7,"And Joseph goeth up to bury his father, and go up with him do all the servants of Pharaoh, elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1050008,1,50,8,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and the house of his father; only their infants, and their flock, and their herd, have they left in the land of Goshen;"
1050009,1,50,9,"and there go up with him both chariot and horsemen, and the camp is very great."
1050010,1,50,10,"And they come unto the threshing-floor of Atad, which `is' beyond the Jordan, and they lament there, a lamentation great and very grievous; and he maketh for his father a mourning seven days,"
1050011,1,50,11,"and the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, see the mourning in the threshing-floor of Atad, and say, `A grievous mourning `is' this to the Egyptians;' therefore hath `one' called its name `The mourning of the Egyptians,' which `is' beyond the Jordan."
1050012,1,50,12,"And his sons do to him so as he commanded them,"
1050013,1,50,13,"and his sons bear him away to the land of Canaan, and bury him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place, from Ephron the Hittite, on the front of Mamre."
1050014,1,50,14,"And Joseph turneth back to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all who are going up with him to bury his father, after his burying his father."
1050015,1,50,15,"And the brethren of Joseph see that their father is dead, and say, `Peradventure Joseph doth hate us, and doth certainly return to us all the evil which we did with him.'"
1050016,1,50,16,"And they give a charge for Joseph, saying, `Thy father commanded before his death, saying,"
1050017,1,50,17,"Thus ye do say to Joseph, I pray thee, bear, I pray thee, with the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for they have done thee evil; and now, bear, we pray thee, with the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father;' and Joseph weepeth in their speaking unto him."
1050018,1,50,18,"And his brethren also go and fall before him, and say, `Lo, we `are' to thee for servants.'"
1050019,1,50,19,"And Joseph saith unto them, `Fear not, for `am' I in the place of God?"
1050020,1,50,20,"As for you, ye devised against me evil -- God devised it for good, in order to do as `at' this day, to keep alive a numerous people;"
1050021,1,50,21,"and now, fear not: I do nourish you and your infants;' and he comforteth them, and speaketh unto their heart."
1050022,1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelleth in Egypt, he and the house of his father, and Joseph liveth a hundred and ten years,"
1050023,1,50,23,"and Joseph looketh on Ephraim's sons of the third `generation'; sons also of Machir, son of Manasseh, have been born on the knees of Joseph."
1050024,1,50,24,"And Joseph saith unto his brethren, `I am dying, and God doth certainly inspect you, and hath caused you to go up from this land, unto the land which He hath sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.'"
1050025,1,50,25,"And Joseph causeth the sons of Israel to swear, saying, `God doth certainly inspect you, and ye have brought up my bones from this `place'.'"
1050026,1,50,26,"And Joseph dieth, a son of an hundred and ten years, and they embalm him, and he is put into a coffin in Egypt."
2001001,2,1,1,And these `are' the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his household have they come;
2001002,2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2001003,2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2001004,2,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
2001005,2,1,5,"And all the persons coming out of the thigh of Jacob are seventy persons; as to Joseph, he was in Egypt."
2001006,2,1,6,"And Joseph dieth, and all his brethren, and all that generation;"
2001007,2,1,7,"and the sons of Israel have been fruitful, and they teem, and multiply, and are very very mighty, and the land is filled with them."
2001008,2,1,8,"And there riseth a new king over Egypt, who hath not known Joseph,"
2001009,2,1,9,"and he saith unto his people, `Lo, the people of the sons of Israel `is' more numerous and mighty than we;"
2001010,2,1,10,"give help! let us act wisely concerning it, lest it multiply, and it hath come to pass, when war happeneth, that it hath been joined, even it, unto those hating us, and hath fought against us, and hath gone out up of the land.'"
2001011,2,1,11,"And they set over it princes of tribute, so as to afflict it with their burdens, and it buildeth store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses;"
2001012,2,1,12,"and as they afflict it, so it multiplieth, and so it breaketh forth, and they are vexed because of the sons of Israel;"
2001013,2,1,13,"and the Egyptians cause the sons of Israel to serve with rigour,"
2001014,2,1,14,"and make their lives bitter in hard service, in clay, and in brick, and in every `kind' of service in the field; all their service in which they have served `is' with rigour."
2001015,2,1,15,"And the king of Egypt speaketh to the midwives, the Hebrewesses, (of whom the name of the one `is' Shiphrah, and the name of the second Puah),"
2001016,2,1,16,"and saith, `When ye cause the Hebrew women to bear, and have looked on the children; if it `is' a son -- then ye have put him to death; and if it `is' a daughter -- then she hath lived.'"
2001017,2,1,17,"And the midwives fear God, and have not done as the king of Egypt hath spoken unto them, and keep the lads alive;"
2001018,2,1,18,"and the king of Egypt calleth for the midwives, and saith to them, `Wherefore have ye done this thing, and keep the lads alive?'"
2001019,2,1,19,"And the midwives say unto Pharaoh, `Because the Hebrew women `are' not as the Egyptian women, for they `are' lively; before the midwife cometh in unto them -- they have borne!'"
2001020,2,1,20,"And God doth good to the midwives, and the people multiply, and are very mighty;"
2001021,2,1,21,"and it cometh to pass, because the midwives have feared God, that He maketh for them households;"
2001022,2,1,22,"and Pharaoh layeth a charge on all his people, saying, `Every son who is born -- into the River ye do cast him, and every daughter ye do keep alive.'"
2002001,2,2,1,"And there goeth a man of the house of Levi, and he taketh the daughter of Levi,"
2002002,2,2,2,"and the woman conceiveth, and beareth a son, and she seeth him that he `is' fair, and she hideth him three months,"
2002003,2,2,3,"and she hath not been able any more to hide him, and she taketh for him an ark of rushes, and daubeth it with bitumen and with pitch, and putteth the lad in it, and putteth `it' in the weeds by the edge of the River;"
2002004,2,2,4,"and his sister stationeth herself afar off, to know what is done to him."
2002005,2,2,5,"And a daughter of Pharaoh cometh down to bathe at the River, and her damsels are walking by the side of the River, and she seeth the ark in the midst of the weeds, and sendeth her handmaid, and she taketh it,"
2002006,2,2,6,"and openeth, and seeth him -- the lad, and lo, a child weeping! and she hath pity on him, and saith, `This is `one' of the Hebrews' children.'"
2002007,2,2,7,"And his sister saith unto the daughter of Pharaoh, `Do I go? when I have called for thee a suckling woman of the Hebrews, then she doth suckle the lad for thee;'"
2002008,2,2,8,"and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her, `Go;' and the virgin goeth, and calleth the mother of the lad,"
2002009,2,2,9,"and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her, `Take this lad away, and suckle him for me, and I -- I give thy hire;' and the woman taketh the lad, and suckleth him."
2002010,2,2,10,"And the lad groweth, and she bringeth him in to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he is to her for a son, and she calleth his name Moses, and saith, `Because -- from the water I have drawn him.'"
2002011,2,2,11,"And it cometh to pass, in those days, that Moses is grown, and he goeth out unto his brethren, and looketh on their burdens, and seeth a man, an Egyptian, smiting a man, a Hebrew, `one' of his brethren,"
2002012,2,2,12,"and he turneth hither and thither, and seeth that there is no man, and smiteth the Egyptian, and hideth him in the sand."
2002013,2,2,13,"And he goeth out on the second day, and lo, two men, Hebrews, striving! and he saith to the wrong-doer, `Why dost thou smite thy neighbour?'"
2002014,2,2,14,"and he saith, `Who set thee for a head and a judge over us? to slay me art thou saying `it', as thou hast slain the Egyptian?' and Moses feareth, and saith, `Surely the thing hath been known.'"
2002015,2,2,15,"And Pharaoh heareth of this thing, and seeketh to slay Moses, and Moses fleeth from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelleth in the land of Midian, and dwelleth by the well."
2002016,2,2,16,"And to a priest of Midian `are' seven daughters, and they come and draw, and fill the troughs, to water the flock of their father,"
2002017,2,2,17,"and the shepherds come and drive them away, and Moses ariseth, and saveth them, and watereth their flock."
2002018,2,2,18,"And they come in to Reuel their father, and he saith, `Wherefore have ye hastened to come in to-day?'"
2002019,2,2,19,"and they say, `A man, an Egyptian, hath delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also hath diligently drawn for us, and watereth the flock;'"
2002020,2,2,20,"and he saith unto his daughters, `And where `is' he? why `is' this? -- ye left the man! call for him, and he doth eat bread.'"
2002021,2,2,21,"And Moses is willing to dwell with the man, and he giveth Zipporah his daughter to Moses,"
2002022,2,2,22,"and she beareth a son, and he calleth his name Gershom, for he said, `A sojourner I have been in a strange land.'"
2002023,2,2,23,"And it cometh to pass during these many days, that the king of Egypt dieth, and the sons of Israel sigh because of the service, and cry, and their cry goeth up unto God, because of the service;"
2002024,2,2,24,"and God heareth their groaning, and God remembereth His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;"
2002025,2,2,25,"and God seeth the sons of Israel, and God knoweth."
2003001,2,3,1,"And Moses hath been feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, priest of Midian, and he leadeth the flock behind the wilderness, and cometh in unto the mount of God, to Horeb;"
2003002,2,3,2,"and there appeareth unto him a messenger of Jehovah in a flame of fire, out of the midst of the bush, and he seeth, and lo, the bush is burning with fire, and the bush is not consumed."
2003003,2,3,3,"And Moses saith, `Let me turn aside, I pray thee, and I see this great appearance; wherefore is the bush not burned?'"
2003004,2,3,4,"and Jehovah seeth that he hath turned aside to see, and God calleth unto him out of the midst of the bush, and saith, `Moses, Moses;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
2003005,2,3,5,"And He saith, `Come not near hither: cast thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou art standing is holy ground.'"
2003006,2,3,6,"He saith also, `I `am' the God of thy father, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob;' and Moses hideth his face, for he is afraid to look towards God."
2003007,2,3,7,"And Jehovah saith, `I have certainly seen the affliction of My people who `are' in Egypt, and their cry I have heard, because of its exactors, for I have known its pains;"
2003008,2,3,8,"and I go down to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to cause it to go up out of the land, unto a land good and broad, unto a land flowing with milk and honey -- unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
2003009,2,3,9,"`And now, lo, the cry of the sons of Israel hath come in unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them,"
2003010,2,3,10,"and now, come, and I send thee unto Pharaoh, and bring thou out My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.'"
2003011,2,3,11,"And Moses saith unto God, `Who `am' I, that I go unto Pharaoh, and that I bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt?'"
2003012,2,3,12,"and He saith, `Because I am with thee, and this `is' to thee the sign that I have sent thee: in thy bringing out the people from Egypt -- ye do serve God on this mount.'"
2003013,2,3,13,"And Moses saith unto God, `Lo, I am coming unto the sons of Israel, and have said to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they have said to me, What `is' His name? what do I say unto them?'"
2003014,2,3,14,"And God saith unto Moses, `I AM THAT WHICH I AM;' He saith also, `Thus dost thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.'"
2003015,2,3,15,"And God saith again unto Moses, `Thus dost thou say unto the sons of Israel, Jehovah, God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this `is' My name -- to the age, and this My memorial, to generation -- generation."
2003016,2,3,16,"`Go, and thou hast gathered the elders of Israel, and hast said unto them: Jehovah, God of your fathers, hath appeareth unto me, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have certainly inspected you, and that which is done to you in Egypt;"
2003017,2,3,17,"and I say, I bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing `with' milk and honey."
2003018,2,3,18,"`And they have hearkened to thy voice, and thou hast entered, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye have said unto him, Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, hath met with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we sacrifice to Jehovah our God."
2003019,2,3,19,"`And I -- I have known that the king of Egypt doth not permit you to go, unless by a strong hand,"
2003020,2,3,20,"and I have put forth My hand, and have smitten Egypt with all My wonders, which I do in its midst -- and afterwards he doth send you away."
2003021,2,3,21,"`And I have given the grace of this people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it hath come to pass, when ye go, ye go not empty;"
2003022,2,3,22,"and `every' woman hath asked from her neighbour, and from her who is sojourning in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and ye have put `them' on your sons and on your daughters, and have spoiled the Egyptians.'"
2004001,2,4,1,"And Moses answereth and saith, `And, if they do not give credence to me, nor hearken to my voice, and say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee?'"
2004002,2,4,2,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `What `is' this in thy hand?' and he saith, `A rod;'"
2004003,2,4,3,"and He saith, `Cast it to the earth;' and he casteth it to the earth, and it becometh a serpent -- and Moses fleeth from its presence."
2004004,2,4,4,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put forth thy hand, and lay hold on the tail of it;' and he putteth forth his hand, and layeth hold on it, and it becometh a rod in his hand --"
2004005,2,4,5,"`-- so that they believe that Jehovah, God of their fathers, hath appeared unto thee, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.'"
2004006,2,4,6,"And Jehovah saith to him again, `Put in, I pray thee, thy hand into thy bosom;' and he putteth in his hand into his bosom, and he bringeth it out, and lo, his hand `is' leprous as snow;"
2004007,2,4,7,"and He saith, `Put back thy hand unto thy bosom;' and he putteth back his hand unto his bosom, and he bringeth it out from his bosom, and lo, it hath turned back as his flesh --"
2004008,2,4,8,"`-- and it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence to thee, and hearken not to the voice of the first sign, that they have given credence to the voice of the latter sign."
2004009,2,4,9,"`And it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence even to these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou hast taken of the waters of the River, and hast poured on the dry land, and the waters which thou takest from the River have been, yea, they have become -- blood on the dry land.'"
2004010,2,4,10,"And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `O, my Lord, I `am' not a man of words, either yesterday, or before, or since Thy speaking unto Thy servant, for I `am' slow of mouth, and slow of tongue.'"
2004011,2,4,11,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `Who appointed a mouth for man? or who appointeth the dumb, or deaf, or open, or blind? is it not I, Jehovah?"
2004012,2,4,12,"and now, go, and I -- I am with thy mouth, and have directed thee that which thou speakest;'"
2004013,2,4,13,"and he saith, `O, my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand Thou dost send.'"
2004014,2,4,14,"And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Moses, and He saith, `Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I have known that he speaketh well, and also, lo, he is coming out to meet thee; when he hath seen thee, then he hath rejoiced in his heart,"
2004015,2,4,15,"and thou hast spoken unto him, and hast set the words in his mouth, and I -- I am with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and have directed you that which ye do;"
2004016,2,4,16,"and he, he hath spoken for thee unto the people, and it hath come to pass, he -- he is to thee for a mouth, and thou -- thou art to him for God;"
2004017,2,4,17,"and this rod thou dost take in thy hand, with which thou doest the signs.'"
2004018,2,4,18,"And Moses goeth and turneth back unto Jethro his father-in-law, and saith to him, `Let me go, I pray thee, and I turn back unto my brethren who `are' in Egypt, and I see whether they are yet alive.' And Jethro saith to Moses, `Go in peace.'"
2004019,2,4,19,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses in Midian, `Go, turn back to Egypt, for all the men have died who seek thy life;'"
2004020,2,4,20,"and Moses taketh his wife, and his sons, and causeth them to ride on the ass, and turneth back to the land of Egypt, and Moses taketh the rod of God in his hand."
2004021,2,4,21,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `In thy going to turn back to Egypt, see -- all the wonders which I have put in thy hand -- that thou hast done them before Pharaoh, and I -- I strengthen his heart, and he doth not send the people away;"
2004022,2,4,22,"and thou hast said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah, My son, My first-born `is' Israel,"
2004023,2,4,23,"and I say unto thee, Send away My son, and he doth serve Me; and -- thou dost refuse to send him away -- lo, I am slaying thy son, thy first-born.'"
2004024,2,4,24,"And it cometh to pass in the way, in a lodging place, that Jehovah meeteth him, and seeketh to put him to death;"
2004025,2,4,25,"and Zipporah taketh a flint, and cutteth off the foreskin of her son, and causeth `it' to touch his feet, and saith, `Surely a bridegroom of blood `art' thou to me;'"
2004026,2,4,26,"and He desisteth from him: then she said, `A bridegroom of blood,' in reference to the circumcision."
2004027,2,4,27,"And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Go to meet Moses into the wilderness;' and he goeth, and meeteth him in the mount of God, and kisseth him,"
2004028,2,4,28,"and Moses declareth to Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He hath sent him, and all the signs with which He hath charged him."
2004029,2,4,29,"And Moses goeth -- Aaron also -- and they gather all the elders of the sons of Israel,"
2004030,2,4,30,"and Aaron speaketh all the words which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses, and doth the signs before the eyes of the people;"
2004031,2,4,31,"and the people believe when they hear that Jehovah hath looked after the sons of Israel, and that He hath seen their affliction; and they bow and do obeisance."
2005001,2,5,1,"And afterwards have Moses and Aaron entered, and they say unto Pharaoh, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Send My people away, and they keep a feast to Me in the wilderness;'"
2005002,2,5,2,"and Pharaoh saith, `Who `is' Jehovah, that I hearken to His voice, to send Israel away? I have not known Jehovah, and Israel also I do not send away.'"
2005003,2,5,3,"And they say, `The God of the Hebrews hath met with us, let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest He meet us with pestilence or with sword.'"
2005004,2,5,4,"And the king of Egypt saith unto them, `Why, Moses and Aaron, do ye free the people from its works? go to your burdens.'"
2005005,2,5,5,"Pharaoh also saith, `Lo, numerous now `is' the people of the land, and ye have caused them to cease from their burdens!'"
2005006,2,5,6,"And Pharaoh commandeth, on that day, the exactors among the people and its authorities, saying,"
2005007,2,5,7,"`Ye do not add to give straw to the people for the making of the bricks, as heretofore -- they go and have gathered straw for themselves;"
2005008,2,5,8,"and the proper quantity of the bricks which they are making heretofore ye do put on them, ye do not diminish from it, for they are remiss, therefore they are crying, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God;"
2005009,2,5,9,"let the service be heavy on the men, and let them work at it, and not be dazzled by lying words.'"
2005010,2,5,10,"And the exactors of the people, and its authorities, go out, and speak unto the people, saying, `Thus said Pharaoh, I do not give you straw,"
2005011,2,5,11,"ye -- go ye, take for yourselves straw where ye find `it', for there is nothing of your service diminished.'"
2005012,2,5,12,"And the people is scattered over all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw,"
2005013,2,5,13,"and the exactors are making haste, saying, `Complete your works, the matter of a day in its day, as when there is straw.'"
2005014,2,5,14,"And the authorities of the sons of Israel, whom the exactors of Pharaoh have placed over them, are beaten, saying, `Wherefore have ye not completed your portion in making brick as heretofore, both yesterday and to-day?'"
2005015,2,5,15,"And the authorities of the sons of Israel come in and cry unto Pharaoh, saying, `Why dost thou thus to thy servants?"
2005016,2,5,16,"Straw is not given to thy servants, and they are saying to us, Make bricks, and lo, thy servants are smitten -- and thy people hath sinned.'"
2005017,2,5,17,"And he saith, `Remiss -- ye are remiss, therefore ye are saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah;"
2005018,2,5,18,"and now, go, serve; and straw is not given to you, and the measure of bricks ye do give.'"
2005019,2,5,19,"And the authorities of the sons of Israel see them in affliction, saying, `Ye do not diminish from your bricks; the matter of a day in its day.'"
2005020,2,5,20,"And they meet Moses and Aaron standing to meet them, in their coming out from Pharaoh,"
2005021,2,5,21,"and say unto them, `Jehovah look upon you, and judge, because ye have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants -- to give a sword into their hand to slay us.'"
2005022,2,5,22,"And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah, and saith, `Lord, why hast Thou done evil to this people? why `is' this? -- Thou hast sent me!"
2005023,2,5,23,"and since I have come unto Pharaoh, to speak in Thy name, he hath done evil to this people, and Thou hast not at all delivered Thy people.'"
2006001,2,6,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Now dost thou see that which I do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand he doth send them away, yea, with a strong hand he doth cast them out of his land.'"
2006002,2,6,2,"And God speaketh unto Moses, and saith unto him, `I `am' Jehovah,"
2006003,2,6,3,"and I appear unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; as to My name Jehovah, I have not been known to them;"
2006004,2,6,4,"and also I have established My covenant with them, to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they have sojourned;"
2006005,2,6,5,"and also I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are causing to serve, and I remember My covenant."
2006006,2,6,6,"`Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I `am' Jehovah, and I have brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and have delivered you from their service, and have redeemed you by a stretched-out arm, and by great judgments,"
2006007,2,6,7,"and have taken you to Me for a people, and I have been to you for God, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah your God, who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians;"
2006008,2,6,8,"and I have brought you in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and have given it to you -- a possession; I `am' Jehovah.'"
2006009,2,6,9,"And Moses speaketh so unto the sons of Israel, and they hearkened not unto Moses, for anguish of spirit, and for harsh service."
2006010,2,6,10,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2006011,2,6,11,"`Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he doth send the sons of Israel out of his land;"
2006012,2,6,12,"and Moses speaketh before Jehovah, saying, `Lo, the sons of Israel have not hearkened unto me, and how doth Pharaoh hear me, and I of uncircumcised lips?'"
2006013,2,6,13,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and chargeth them for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt."
2006014,2,6,14,"These `are' heads of the house of their fathers: Sons of Reuben first-born of Israel `are' Hanoch, and Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these `are' families of Reuben."
2006015,2,6,15,"And sons of Simeon `are' Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, son of the Canaanitess: these `are' families of Simeon."
2006016,2,6,16,"And these `are' the names of the sons of Levi, as to their births: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi `are' a hundred and thirty and seven years."
2006017,2,6,17,"The sons of Gershon `are' Libni, and Shimi, as to their families."
2006018,2,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath `are' Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath `are' a hundred and thirty and three years."
2006019,2,6,19,"And the sons of Merari `are' Mahli and Mushi: these `are' families of Levi, as to their births."
2006020,2,6,20,"And Amram taketh Jochebed his aunt to himself for a wife, and she beareth to him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram `are' a hundred and thirty and seven years."
2006021,2,6,21,"And sons of Izhar `are' Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri."
2006022,2,6,22,"And sons of Uzziel `are' Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri."
2006023,2,6,23,"And Aaron taketh Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to himself for a wife, and she beareth to him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
2006024,2,6,24,"And sons of Korah `are' Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these `are' families of the Korhite."
2006025,2,6,25,"And Eleazar, Aaron's son, hath taken to him `one' of the daughters of Putiel for a wife to himself, and she beareth to him Phinehas: these `are' heads of the fathers of the Levites, as to their families."
2006026,2,6,26,"This `is' Aaron -- and Moses -- to whom Jehovah said, `Bring ye out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their hosts;'"
2006027,2,6,27,"these are they who are speaking unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt, this `is' Moses -- and Aaron."
2006028,2,6,28,"And it cometh to pass in the day of Jehovah's speaking unto Moses in the land of Egypt,"
2006029,2,6,29,"that Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying, `I `am' Jehovah, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I am speaking unto thee.'"
2006030,2,6,30,"And Moses saith before Jehovah, `Lo, I `am' of uncircumcised lips, and how doth Pharaoh hearken unto me?'"
2007001,2,7,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `See, I have given thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother is thy prophet;"
2007002,2,7,2,"thou -- thou dost speak all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother doth speak unto Pharaoh, and he hath sent the sons of Israel out of his land."
2007003,2,7,3,"`And I harden the heart of Pharaoh, and have multiplied My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt,"
2007004,2,7,4,"and Pharaoh doth not hearken, and I have put My hand on Egypt, and have brought out My hosts, My people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments;"
2007005,2,7,5,"and the Egyptians have known that I `am' Jehovah, in My stretching out My hand against Egypt; and I have brought out the sons of Israel from their midst.'"
2007006,2,7,6,And Moses doth -- Aaron also -- as Jehovah commanded them; so have they done;
2007007,2,7,7,"and Moses `is' a son of eighty years, and Aaron `is' a son of eighty and three years, in their speaking unto Pharaoh."
2007008,2,7,8,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
2007009,2,7,9,"`When Pharaoh speaketh unto you, saying, Give for yourselves a wonder; then thou hast said unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast before Pharaoh -- it becometh a monster.'"
2007010,2,7,10,"And Moses goeth in -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh, and they do so as Jehovah hath commanded; and Aaron casteth his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it becometh a monster."
2007011,2,7,11,"And Pharaoh also calleth for wise men, and for sorcerers; and the scribes of Egypt, they also, with their flashings, do so,"
2007012,2,7,12,"and they cast down each his rod, and they become monsters, and the rod of Aaron swalloweth their rods;"
2007013,2,7,13,"and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he hath not hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken."
2007014,2,7,14,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The heart of Pharaoh hath been hard, he hath refused to send the people away;"

2007016,2,7,16,"and thou hast said unto him: Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Send My people away, and they serve Me in the wilderness; and lo, thou hast not hearkened hitherto."
2007017,2,7,17,"`Thus said Jehovah: By this thou knowest that I `am' Jehovah; lo, I am smiting with the rod which `is' in my hand, on the waters which `are' in the River, and they have been turned to blood,"
2007018,2,7,18,"and the fish that `are' in the River die, and the River hath stank, and the Egyptians have been wearied of drinking waters from the River.'"
2007019,2,7,19,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand against the waters of Egypt, against their streams, against their rivers, and against their ponds, and against all their collections of waters; and they are blood -- and there hath been blood in all the land of Egypt, both in `vessels of' wood, and in `those of' stone.'"
2007020,2,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron do so, as Jehovah hath commanded, and he lifteth up `his hand' with the rod, and smiteth the waters which `are' in the River, before the eyes of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his servants, and all the waters which `are' in the River are turned to blood,"
2007021,2,7,21,"and the fish which `is' in the River hath died, and the River stinketh, and the Egyptians have not been able to drink water from the River; and the blood is in all the land of Egypt."
2007022,2,7,22,"And the scribes of Egypt do so with their flashings, and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he hath not hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken,"
2007023,2,7,23,"and Pharaoh turneth and goeth in unto his house, and hath not set his heart even to this;"
2007024,2,7,24,"and all the Egyptians seek water round about the river to drink, for they have not been able to drink of the waters of the River."
2007025,2,7,25,"And seven days are completed after Jehovah's smiting the River,"
2008001,2,8,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go in unto Pharaoh: and thou hast said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, Send My people away, and they serve Me;"
2008002,2,8,2,"and if thou art refusing to send away, lo, I am smiting all thy border with frogs;"
2008003,2,8,3,"and the River hath teemed `with' frogs, and they have gone up and gone into thy house, and into the inner-chamber of thy bed, and on thy couch, and into the house of thy servants, and among thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs;"
2008004,2,8,4,"yea, on thee, and on thy people, and on all thy servants do the frogs go up.'"
2008005,2,8,5,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy hand, with thy rod, against the streams, against the rivers, and against the ponds, and cause the frogs to come up against the land of Egypt.'"
2008006,2,8,6,"And Aaron stretcheth out his hand against the waters of Egypt, and the frog cometh up, and covereth the land of Egypt;"
2008007,2,8,7,"and the scribes do so with their flashings, and cause the frogs to come up against the land of Egypt."
2008008,2,8,8,"And Pharaoh calleth for Moses and for Aaron, and saith, `Make supplication unto Jehovah, that he turn aside the frogs from me, and from my people, and I send the people away, and they sacrifice to Jehovah.'"
2008009,2,8,9,"And Moses saith to Pharaoh, `Beautify thyself over me; when do I make supplication for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses -- only in the River they do remain?'"
2008010,2,8,10,"and he saith, `To-morrow.' And he saith, According to thy word `it is', so that thou knowest that there is none like Jehovah our God,"
2008011,2,8,11,"and the frogs have turned aside from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the River they do remain.'"
2008012,2,8,12,"And Moses -- Aaron also -- goeth out from Pharaoh, and Moses crieth unto Jehovah, concerning the matter of the frogs which He hath set on Pharaoh;"
2008013,2,8,13,"and Jehovah doth according to the word of Moses, and the frogs die out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields,"
2008014,2,8,14,"and they heap them up together, and the land stinketh."
2008015,2,8,15,"And Pharaoh seeth that there hath been a respite, and he hath hardened his heart, and hath not hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken."
2008016,2,8,16,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, and it hath become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'"
2008017,2,8,17,"And they do so, and Aaron stretcheth out his hand with his rod, and smiteth the dust of the land, and the gnats are on man and on beast; all the dust of the land hath been gnats in all the land of Egypt."
2008018,2,8,18,"And the scribes do so with their flashings, to bring out the gnats, and they have not been able, and the gnats are on man and on beast;"
2008019,2,8,19,"and the scribes say unto Pharaoh, `It `is' the finger of God;' and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he hath not hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken."
2008020,2,8,20,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Rise early in the morning, and station thyself before Pharaoh, lo, he is going out to the waters, and thou hast said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, Send My people away, and they serve Me;"
2008021,2,8,21,"for, if thou art not sending My people away, lo, I am sending against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and against thy houses, the beetle, and the houses of the Egyptians have been full of the beetle, and also the ground on which they are."
2008022,2,8,22,"`And I have separated in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people are staying, that the beetle is not there, so that thou knowest that I `am' Jehovah in the midst of the land,"
2008023,2,8,23,and I have put a division between My people and thy people: to-morrow is this sign.'
2008024,2,8,24,"And Jehovah doth so, and the grievous beetle entereth the house of Pharaoh, and the house of his servants, and in all the land of Egypt the land is corrupted from the presence of the beetle."
2008025,2,8,25,"And Pharaoh calleth unto Moses and to Aaron, and saith, `Go, sacrifice to your God in the land;'"
2008026,2,8,26,"and Moses saith, `Not right to do so, for the abomination of the Egyptians we do sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lo, we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes -- and they do not stone us!"
2008027,2,8,27,"A journey of three days we go into the wilderness, and have sacrificed to Jehovah our God, as He saith unto us.'"
2008028,2,8,28,"And Pharaoh saith, `I send you away, and ye have sacrificed to Jehovah your God in the wilderness, only go not very far off; make ye supplication for me;'"
2008029,2,8,29,"and Moses saith, `Lo, I am going out from thee, and have made supplication unto Jehovah, and the beetle hath turned aside from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people -- to-morrow, only let not Pharaoh add to deceive -- in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.'"
2008030,2,8,30,"And Moses goeth out from Pharaoh, and maketh supplication unto Jehovah,"
2008031,2,8,31,"and Jehovah doth according to the word of Moses, and turneth aside the beetle from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people -- there hath not been left one;"
2008032,2,8,32,"and Pharaoh hardeneth his heart also at this time, and hath not sent the people away."
2009001,2,9,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go in unto Pharaoh, and thou hast spoken unto him, Thus said Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, Send My people away, and they serve me,"
2009002,2,9,2,"for, if thou art refusing to send away, and art still keeping hold upon them,"
2009003,2,9,3,"lo, the hand of Jehovah is on thy cattle which `are' in the field, on horses, on asses, on camels, on herd, and on flock -- a pestilence very grievous."
2009004,2,9,4,"`And Jehovah hath separated between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there doth not die a thing of all the sons of Israel's;"
2009005,2,9,5,"and Jehovah setteth an appointed time, saying, To-morrow doth Jehovah do this thing in the land.'"
2009006,2,9,6,"And Jehovah doth this thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt die, and of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one hath died;"
2009007,2,9,7,"and Pharaoh sendeth, and lo, not even one of the cattle of Israel hath died, and the heart of Pharaoh is hard, and he hath not sent the people away."
2009008,2,9,8,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses and unto Aaron, `Take to you the fulness of your hands `of' soot of a furnace, and Moses hath sprinkled it towards the heavens, before the eyes of Pharaoh,"
2009009,2,9,9,"and it hath become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and it hath become on man and on cattle a boil breaking forth `with' blains, in all the land of Egypt.'"
2009010,2,9,10,"And they take the soot of the furnace, and stand before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkleth it towards the heavens, and it is a boil `with' blains, breaking forth, on man and on beast;"
2009011,2,9,11,"and the scribes have not been able to stand before Moses, because of the boil, for the boil hath been on the scribes, and on all the Egyptians."
2009012,2,9,12,"And Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he hath not hearkened unto them, as Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses."
2009013,2,9,13,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Rise early in the morning, and station thyself before Pharaoh, and thou hast said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, Send My people away, and they serve Me,"
2009014,2,9,14,"for, at this time I am sending all My plagues unto thy heart, and on thy servants, and on thy people, so that thou knowest that there is none like Me in all the earth,"
2009015,2,9,15,"for now I have put forth My hand, and I smite thee, and thy people, with pestilence, and thou art hidden from the earth."
2009016,2,9,16,"`And yet for this I have caused thee to stand, so as to show thee My power, and for the sake of declaring My Name in all the earth;"
2009017,2,9,17,still thou art exalting thyself against My people -- so as not to send them away;
2009018,2,9,18,"lo, I am raining about `this' time to-morrow hail very grievous, such as hath not been in Egypt, even from the day of its being founded, even until now."
2009019,2,9,19,"`And, now, send, strengthen thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; every man and beast which is found in the field, and is not gathered into the house -- come down on them hath the hail, and they have died.'"
2009020,2,9,20,He who is fearing the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh hath caused his servants and his cattle to flee unto the houses;
2009021,2,9,21,and he who hath not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah leaveth his servants and his cattle in the field.
2009022,2,9,22,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Stretch forth thy hand towards the heavens, and there is hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on beast, and on every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.'"
2009023,2,9,23,"And Moses stretcheth out his rod towards the heavens, and Jehovah hath given voices and hail, and fire goeth towards the earth, and Jehovah raineth hail on the land of Egypt,"
2009024,2,9,24,"and there is hail, and fire catching itself in the midst of the hail, very grievous, such as hath not been in all the land of Egypt since it hath become a nation."
2009025,2,9,25,"And the hail smiteth in all the land of Egypt all that `is' in the field, from man even unto beast, and every herb of the field hath the hail smitten, and every tree of the field it hath broken;"
2009026,2,9,26,"only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel `are', there hath been no hail."
2009027,2,9,27,"And Pharaoh sendeth, and calleth for Moses and for Aaron, and saith unto them, `I have sinned this time, Jehovah `is' the Righteous, and I and my people `are' the Wicked,"
2009028,2,9,28,"make ye supplication unto Jehovah, and plead that there be no voices of God and hail, and I send you away, and ye add not to remain.'"
2009029,2,9,29,"And Moses saith unto him, `At my going out of the city, I spread my palms unto Jehovah -- the voices cease, and the hail is not any more, so that thou knowest that the earth `is' Jehovah's;"
2009030,2,9,30,but thou and thy servants -- I have known that ye are not yet afraid of the face of Jehovah God.'
2009031,2,9,31,"And the flax and the barley have been smitten, for the barley `is' budding, and the flax forming flowers,"
2009032,2,9,32,"and the wheat and the rye have not been smitten, for they are late."
2009033,2,9,33,"And Moses goeth out from Pharaoh, `from' the city, and spreadeth his hands unto Jehovah, and the voices and the hail cease, and rain hath not been poured out to the earth;"
2009034,2,9,34,"and Pharaoh seeth that the rain hath ceased, and the hail and the voices, and he continueth to sin, and hardeneth his heart, he and his servants;"
2009035,2,9,35,"and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he hath not sent the sons of Israel away, as Jehovah hath spoken by the hand of Moses."
2010001,2,10,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have declared hard his heart, and the heart of his servants, so that I set these My signs in their midst,"
2010002,2,10,2,"and so that thou recountest in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, that which I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have set among them, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah.'"
2010003,2,10,3,"And Moses cometh in -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh, and they say unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, Until when hast thou refused to be humbled at My presence? send My people away, and they serve Me,"
2010004,2,10,4,"for if thou art refusing to send My people away, lo, I am bringing in to-morrow the locust into thy border,"
2010005,2,10,5,"and it hath covered the eye of the land, and none is able to see the land, and it hath eaten the remnant of that which is escaped, which is left to you from the hail, and it hath eaten every tree which is springing for you out of the field;"
2010006,2,10,6,"and they have filled thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers nor thy father's fathers have seen, since the day of their being on the ground unto this day,' -- and he turneth and goeth out from Pharaoh."
2010007,2,10,7,"And the servants of Pharaoh say unto him, `Until when doth this `one' become a snare to us? send the men away, and they serve Jehovah their God; knowest thou not yet that Egypt hath perished?'"
2010008,2,10,8,"And Moses is brought back -- Aaron also -- unto Pharaoh, and he saith unto them, `Go, serve Jehovah your God; -- who and who `are' those going?'"
2010009,2,10,9,"And Moses saith, `With our young ones, and with our aged ones, we go, with our sons, and with our daughters, with our flock, and our herd, we go, for we have a festival to Jehovah.'"
2010010,2,10,10,"And he saith unto them, `Be it so, Jehovah `be' with you when I send you and your infants away; see -- for evil `is' before your faces;"
2010011,2,10,11,"not so! go now, ye who `are' men, and serve Jehovah, for that ye are seeking;' and `one' casteth them out from the presence of Pharaoh."
2010012,2,10,12,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Stretch out thy hand against the land of Egypt for the locust, and it goeth up against the land of Egypt, and doth eat every herb of the land -- all that the hail hath left.'"
2010013,2,10,13,"And Moses stretcheth out his rod against the land of Egypt, and Jehovah hath led an east wind over the land all that day, and all the night; the morning hath been, and the east wind hath lifted up the locust."
2010014,2,10,14,"And the locust goeth up against all the land of Egypt, and resteth in all the border of Egypt -- very grievous: before it there hath not been such a locust as it, and after it there is none such;"
2010015,2,10,15,"and it covereth the eye of all the land, and the land is darkened; and it eateth every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail hath left, and there hath not been left any green thing in the trees, or in the herb of the field, in all the land of Egypt.'"
2010016,2,10,16,"And Pharaoh hasteth to call for Moses and for Aaron, and saith, `I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you,"
2010017,2,10,17,"and now, bear with, I pray you, my sin, only this time, and make ye supplication to Jehovah your God, that He turn aside from off me only this death.'"
2010018,2,10,18,"And he goeth out from Pharaoh, and maketh supplication unto Jehovah,"
2010019,2,10,19,"and Jehovah turneth a very strong sea wind, and it lifteth up the locust, and bloweth it into the Red Sea -- there hath not been left one locust in all the border of Egypt;"
2010020,2,10,20,"and Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he hath not sent the sons of Israel away."
2010021,2,10,21,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Stretch out thy hand towards the heavens, and there is darkness over the land of Egypt, and the darkness is felt.'"
2010022,2,10,22,"And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the heavens, and there is darkness -- thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;"
2010023,2,10,23,"they have not seen one another, and none hath risen from his place three days; and to all the sons of Israel there hath been light in their dwellings.'"
2010024,2,10,24,"And Pharaoh calleth unto Moses and saith, `Go ye, serve Jehovah, only your flock and your herd are stayed, your infants also go with you;'"
2010025,2,10,25,"and Moses saith, `Thou also dost give in our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we have prepared for Jehovah our God;"
2010026,2,10,26,"and also our cattle doth go with us, there is not left a hoof, for from it we do take to serve Jehovah our God; and we -- we know not how we do serve Jehovah till our going thither.'"
2010027,2,10,27,"And Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he hath not been willing to send them away;"
2010028,2,10,28,"and Pharaoh saith to him, `Go from me, take heed to thyself, add not to see my face, for in the day thou seest my face thou diest;'"
2010029,2,10,29,"and Moses saith, `Rightly hast thou spoken, I add not any more to see thy face.'"
2011001,2,11,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `One plague more I do bring in on Pharaoh, and on Egypt, afterwards he doth send you away from this; when he is sending you away, he surely casteth you out altogether from this `place';"
2011002,2,11,2,"speak, I pray thee, in the ears of the people, and they ask -- each man from his neighbour, and each woman from her neighbour, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold.'"
2011003,2,11,3,"And Jehovah giveth the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses `is' very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of the people."
2011004,2,11,4,"And Moses saith, `Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,"
2011005,2,11,5,"and every first-born in the land of Egypt hath died, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the maid-servant who `is' behind the millstones, and all the first-born of beasts;"
2011006,2,11,6,"and there hath been a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, and such as there is not again."
2011007,2,11,7,"`And against all the sons of Israel a dog sharpeneth not its tongue, from man even unto beast, so that ye know that Jehovah doth make a separation between the Egyptians and Israel;"
2011008,2,11,8,"and all these thy servants have come down unto me, and bowed themselves to me, saying, Go out, thou and all the people who `are' at thy feet; and afterwards I do go out;' -- and he goeth out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger."
2011009,2,11,9,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Pharaoh doth not hearken unto you, so as to multiply My wonders in the land of Egypt;'"
2011010,2,11,10,"and Moses and Aaron have done all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Jehovah strengtheneth Pharaoh's heart, and he hath not sent the sons of Israel out of his land."
2012001,2,12,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, in the land of Egypt, saying,"
2012002,2,12,2,`This month `is' to you the chief of months -- it `is' the first to you of the months of the year;
2012003,2,12,3,"speak ye unto all the company of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month -- they take to them each man a lamb for the house of the fathers, a lamb for a house."
2012004,2,12,4,"`(And if the household be too few for a lamb, then hath he taken, he and his neighbour who is near unto his house, for the number of persons, each according to his eating ye do count for the lamb,)"
2012005,2,12,5,"a lamb, a perfect one, a male, a son of a year, let be to you; from the sheep or from the goats ye do take `it'."
2012006,2,12,6,"`And it hath become a charge to you, until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole assembly of the company of Israel have slaughtered it between the evenings;"
2012007,2,12,7,"and they have taken of the blood, and have put on the two side-posts, and on the lintel over the houses in which they eat it."
2012008,2,12,8,"`And they have eaten the flesh in this night, roast with fire; with unleavened things and bitters they do eat it;"
2012009,2,12,9,"ye do not eat of it raw, or boiled at all in water, but roast with fire, its head with its legs, and with its inwards;"
2012010,2,12,10,"and ye do not leave of it till morning, and that which is remaining of it till morning with fire ye do burn."
2012011,2,12,11,"`And thus ye do eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and ye have eaten it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover,"
2012012,2,12,12,"and I have passed over through the land of Egypt during this night, and have smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man even unto beast, and on all the gods of Egypt I do judgments; I `am' Jehovah."
2012013,2,12,13,"`And the blood hath become a sign for you on the houses where ye `are', and I have seen the blood, and have passed over you, and a plague is not on you for destruction in My smiting in the land of Egypt."
2012014,2,12,14,"`And this day hath become to you a memorial, and ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah to your generations; -- a statute age-during; ye keep it a feast."
2012015,2,12,15,"Seven days ye eat unleavened things; only -- in the first day ye cause leaven to cease out of your houses; for any one eating anything fermented from the first day till the seventh day, even that person hath been cut off from Israel."
2012016,2,12,16,"`And in the first day `is' a holy convocation, and in the seventh day ye have a holy convocation; any work is not done in them, only that which is eaten by any person -- it alone is done by you,"
2012017,2,12,17,"and ye have observed the unleavened things, for in this self-same day I have brought out your hosts from the land of Egypt, and ye have observed this day to your generations -- a statute age-during."
2012018,2,12,18,"`In the first `month', in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye do eat unleavened things until the one and twentieth day of the month, at evening;"
2012019,2,12,19,"seven days leaven is not found in your houses, for any `one' eating anything fermented -- that person hath been cut off from the company of Israel, among the sojourners or among the natives of the land;"
2012020,2,12,20,"anything fermented ye do not eat, in all your dwellings ye do eat unleavened things.'"
2012021,2,12,21,"And Moses calleth for all the elders of Israel, and saith unto them, `Draw out and take for yourselves `from' the flock, for your families, and slaughter the passover-sacrifice;"
2012022,2,12,22,"and ye have taken a bunch of hyssop, and have dipped `it' in the blood which `is' in the basin, and have struck `it' on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, from the blood which `is' in the basin, and ye, ye go not out each from the opening of his house till morning."
2012023,2,12,23,"`And Jehovah hath passed on to smite the Egyptians, and hath seen the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, and Jehovah hath passed over the opening, and doth not permit the destruction to come into your houses to smite."
2012024,2,12,24,"`And ye have observed this thing, for a statute to thee, and to thy sons -- unto the age;"
2012025,2,12,25,"and it hath been, when ye come in unto the land which Jehovah giveth to you, as He hath spoken, that ye have kept this service;"
2012026,2,12,26,"and it hath come to pass when your sons say unto you, What `is' this service ye have?"
2012027,2,12,27,"that ye have said, A sacrifice of passover it `is' to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, in His smiting the Egyptians, and our houses He delivered.'"
2012028,2,12,28,"And the people bow and do obeisance, and the sons of Israel go and do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done."
2012029,2,12,29,"And it cometh to pass, at midnight, that Jehovah hath smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the captive who `is' in the prison-house, and every first-born of beasts."
2012030,2,12,30,"And Pharaoh riseth by night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there is a great cry in Egypt, for there is not a house where there is not `one' dead,"
2012031,2,12,31,"and he calleth for Moses and for Aaron by night, and saith, `Rise, go out from the midst of my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah according to your word;"
2012032,2,12,32,"both your flock and your herd take ye, as ye have spoken, and go; then ye have blessed also me.'"
2012033,2,12,33,"And the Egyptians are urgent on the people, hasting to send them away out of the land, for they said, `We are all dead;'"
2012034,2,12,34,"and the people taketh up its dough before it is fermented, their kneading-troughs `are' bound up in their garments on their shoulder."
2012035,2,12,35,"And the sons of Israel have done according to the word of Moses, and they ask from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments;"
2012036,2,12,36,"and Jehovah hath given the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they cause them to ask, and they spoil the Egyptians."
2012037,2,12,37,"And the sons of Israel journey from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, apart from infants;"
2012038,2,12,38,"and a great rabble also hath gone up with them, and flock and herd -- very much cattle."
2012039,2,12,39,"And they bake with the dough which they have brought out from Egypt unleavened cakes, for it hath not fermented; for they have been cast out of Egypt, and have not been able to delay, and also provision they have not made for themselves."
2012040,2,12,40,And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have dwelt in Egypt `is' four hundred and thirty years;
2012041,2,12,41,"and it cometh to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years -- yea, it cometh to pass in this self-same day -- all the hosts of Jehovah have gone out from the land of Egypt."
2012042,2,12,42,"A night of watchings it `is' to Jehovah, to bring them out from the land of Egypt; it `is' this night to Jehovah of watchings to all the sons of Israel to their generations."
2012043,2,12,43,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses and Aaron, `This `is' a statute of the passover; Any son of a stranger doth not eat of it;"
2012044,2,12,44,"and any man's servant, the purchase of money, when thou hast circumcised him -- then he doth eat of it;"
2012045,2,12,45,a settler or hired servant doth not eat of it;
2012046,2,12,46,"in one house it is eaten, thou dost not carry out of the house `any' of the flesh without, and a bone ye do not break of it;"
2012047,2,12,47,all the company of Israel do keep it.
2012048,2,12,48,"`And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and hath made a passover to Jehovah, every male of his `is' to be circumcised, and then he doth come near to keep it, and he hath been as a native of the land, but any uncircumcised one doth not eat of it;"
2012049,2,12,49,"one law is to a native, and to a sojourner who is sojourning in your midst.'"
2012050,2,12,50,And all the sons of Israel do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done.
2012051,2,12,51,"And it cometh to pass in this self-same day, Jehovah hath brought out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their hosts."
2013001,2,13,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2013002,2,13,2,"`Sanctify to Me every first-born, opening any womb among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; it `is' Mine.'"
2013003,2,13,3,"And Moses saith unto the people, `Remember this day `in' which ye have gone out from Egypt, from the house of servants, for by strength of hand hath Jehovah brought you out from this, and any thing fermented is not eaten;"
2013004,2,13,4,"To-day ye are going out, in the month of Abib."
2013005,2,13,5,"`And it hath been, when Jehovah bringeth thee in unto the land of the Canaanite, and of the Hittite, and of the Amorite, and of the Hivite, and of the Jebusite, which He hath sworn to thy fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou hast done this service in this month."
2013006,2,13,6,"`Seven days thou dost eat unleavened things, and in the seventh day `is' a feast to Jehovah;"
2013007,2,13,7,"unleavened things are eaten the seven days, and any thing fermented is not seen with thee; yea, leaven is not seen with thee in all thy border."
2013008,2,13,8,"`And thou hast declared to thy son in that day, saying, ``It is' because of what Jehovah did to me, in my going out from Egypt,"
2013009,2,13,9,"and it hath been to thee for a sign on thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, so that the law of Jehovah is in thy mouth, for by a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out from Egypt;"
2013010,2,13,10,and thou hast kept this statute at its appointed season from days to days.
2013011,2,13,11,"`And it hath been, when Jehovah bringeth thee in unto the land of the Canaanite, as He hath sworn to thee and to thy fathers, and hath given it to thee,"
2013012,2,13,12,"that thou hast caused every one opening a womb to pass over to Jehovah, and every firstling -- the increase of beasts which thou hast: the males `are' Jehovah's."
2013013,2,13,13,"`And every firstling of an ass thou dost ransom with a lamb, and if thou dost not ransom `it', then thou hast beheaded it: and every first-born of man among thy sons thou dost ransom."
2013014,2,13,14,"`And it hath been, when thy son asketh thee hereafter, saying, What `is' this? that thou hast said unto him, By strength of hand hath Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from a house of servants;"
2013015,2,13,15,"yea, it cometh to pass, when Pharaoh hath been pained to send us away, that Jehovah doth slay every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man even unto the first-born of beast; therefore I am sacrificing to Jehovah all opening a womb who `are' males, and every first-born of my sons I ransom;"
2013016,2,13,16,"and it hath been for a token on thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes, for by strength of hand hath Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.'"
2013017,2,13,17,"And it cometh to pass in Pharaoh's sending the people away, that God hath not led them the way of the land of the Philistines, for it `is' near; for God said, `Lest the people repent in their seeing war, and have turned back towards Egypt;'"
2013018,2,13,18,"and God turneth round the people the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea, and by fifties have the sons of Israel gone up from the land of Egypt."
2013019,2,13,19,"And Moses taketh the bones of Joseph with him, for he certainly caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, `God doth certainly inspect you, and ye have brought up my bones from this with you.'"
2013020,2,13,20,"And they journey from Succoth, and encamp in Etham at the extremity of the wilderness,"
2013021,2,13,21,"and Jehovah is going before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give light to them, to go by day and by night;"
2013022,2,13,22,"He removeth not the pillar of the cloud by day, and the pillar of the fire by night, `from' before the people."
2014001,2,14,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2014002,2,14,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they turn back and encamp before Pi-Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-Zephon; over-against it ye do encamp by the sea,"
2014003,2,14,3,"and Pharaoh hath said of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them;"
2014004,2,14,4,"and I have strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hath pursued after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, and the Egyptians have known that I `am' Jehovah;' and they do so."
2014005,2,14,5,"And it is declared to the king of Egypt that the people hath fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants is turned against the people, and they say, `What `is' this we have done? that we have sent Israel away from our service.'"
2014006,2,14,6,"And he harnesseth his chariot, and his people he hath taken with him,"
2014007,2,14,7,"and he taketh six hundred chosen chariots, even all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over them all;"
2014008,2,14,8,"and Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursueth after the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel are going out with a high hand,"
2014009,2,14,9,"and the Egyptians pursue after them, and all the chariot horses of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his force, overtake them, encamping by the sea, by Pi-Hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon."
2014010,2,14,10,"And Pharaoh hath drawn near, and the sons of Israel lift up their eyes, and lo, the Egyptians are journeying after them, and they fear exceedingly, and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah."
2014011,2,14,11,"And they say unto Moses, `Because there are no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in a wilderness? what is this thou hast done to us -- to bring us out from Egypt?"
2014012,2,14,12,"Is not this the word which we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and we serve the Egyptians; for better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in a wilderness?'"
2014013,2,14,13,"And Moses saith unto the people, `Fear not, station yourselves, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He doth for you to-day; for, as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye add no more to see them -- to the age;"
2014014,2,14,14,"Jehovah doth fight for you, and ye keep silent.'"
2014015,2,14,15,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `What? thou criest unto Me -- speak unto the sons of Israel, and they journey;"
2014016,2,14,16,"and thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand towards the sea, and cleave it, and the sons of Israel go into the midst of the sea on dry land."
2014017,2,14,17,"`And I -- lo, I am strengthening the heart of the Egyptians, and they go in after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, on his chariots, and on his horsemen;"
2014018,2,14,18,"and the Egyptians have known that I `am' Jehovah, in My being honoured on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.'"
2014019,2,14,19,"And the messenger of God, who is going before the camp of Israel, journeyeth and goeth at their rear; and the pillar of the cloud journeyeth from their front, and standeth at their rear,"
2014020,2,14,20,"and cometh in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and the cloud and the darkness are, and he enlighteneth the night, and the one hath not drawn near unto the other all the night."
2014021,2,14,21,"And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and Jehovah causeth the sea to go on by a strong east wind all the night, and maketh the sea become dry ground, and the waters are cleaved,"
2014022,2,14,22,"and the sons of Israel go into the midst of the sea, on dry land, and the waters `are' to them a wall, on their right and on their left."
2014023,2,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursue, and go in after them (all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen) unto the midst of the sea,"
2014024,2,14,24,"and it cometh to pass, in the morning watch, that Jehovah looketh unto the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubleth the camp of the Egyptians,"
2014025,2,14,25,"and turneth aside the wheels of their chariots, and they lead them with difficulty, and the Egyptians say, `Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.'"
2014026,2,14,26,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Stretch out thy hand toward the sea, and the waters turn back on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.'"
2014027,2,14,27,"And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and the sea turneth back, at the turning of the morning, to its perennial flow, and the Egyptians are fleeing at its coming, and Jehovah shaketh off the Egyptians in the midst of the sea,"
2014028,2,14,28,"and the waters turn back, and cover the chariots and the horsemen, even all the force of Pharaoh, who are coming in after them into the sea -- there hath not been left of them even one."
2014029,2,14,29,"And the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters `are' to them a wall, on their right and on their left;"
2014030,2,14,30,"and Jehovah saveth Israel in that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel seeth the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore,"
2014031,2,14,31,"and Israel seeth the great hand with which Jehovah hath wrought against the Egyptians, and the people fear Jehovah, and remain stedfast in Jehovah, and in Moses His servant."
2015001,2,15,1,"Then singeth Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah, and they speak, saying: -- `I sing to Jehovah, For triumphing He hath triumphed; The horse and its rider He hath thrown into the sea."
2015002,2,15,2,"My strength and song is JAH, And He is become my salvation: This `is' my God, and I glorify Him; God of my father, and I exalt Him."
2015003,2,15,3,Jehovah `is' a man of battle; Jehovah `is' His name.
2015004,2,15,4,Chariots of Pharaoh and his force He hath cast into the sea; And the choice of his captains Have sunk in the Red Sea!
2015005,2,15,5,The depths do cover them; They went down into the depths as a stone.
2015006,2,15,6,"Thy right hand, O Jehovah, Is become honourable in power; Thy right hand, O Jehovah, Doth crush an enemy."
2015007,2,15,7,"And in the abundance of Thine excellency Thou throwest down Thy withstanders, Thou sendest forth Thy wrath -- It consumeth them as stubble."
2015008,2,15,8,And by the spirit of Thine anger Have waters been heaped together; Stood as a heap have flowings; Congealed have been depths In the heart of a sea.
2015009,2,15,9,"The enemy said, I pursue, I overtake; I apportion spoil; Filled is my soul with them; I draw out my sword; My hand destroyeth them: --"
2015010,2,15,10,Thou hast blown with Thy wind The sea hath covered them; They sank as lead in mighty waters.
2015011,2,15,11,"Who `is' like Thee among the gods, O Jehovah? Who `is' like Thee -- honourable in holiness -- Fearful in praises -- doing wonders?"
2015012,2,15,12,Thou hast stretched out Thy right hand -- Earth swalloweth them!
2015013,2,15,13,Thou hast led forth in Thy kindness The people whom Thou hast redeemed. Thou hast led on in Thy strength Unto Thy holy habitation.
2015014,2,15,14,"Peoples have heard, they are troubled; Pain hath seized inhabitants of Philistia."
2015015,2,15,15,Then have chiefs of Edom been troubled: Mighty ones of Moab -- Trembling doth seize them! Melted have all inhabitants of Canaan!
2015016,2,15,16,"Fall on them doth terror and dread; By the greatness of Thine arm They are still as a stone, Till Thy people pass over, O Jehovah; Till the people pass over Whom Thou hast purchased."
2015017,2,15,17,"Thou dost bring them in, And dost plant them In a mountain of Thine inheritance, A fixed place for Thy dwelling Thou hast made, O Jehovah; A sanctuary, O Lord, Thy hands have established;"
2015018,2,15,18,"Jehovah reigneth -- to the age, and for ever!'"
2015019,2,15,19,"For the horse of Pharaoh hath gone in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah turneth back on them the waters of the sea, and the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the midst of the sea."
2015020,2,15,20,"And Miriam the inspired one, sister of Aaron, taketh the timbrel in her hand, and all the women go out after her, with timbrels and with choruses;"
2015021,2,15,21,"and Miriam answereth to them: -- `Sing ye to Jehovah, For Triumphing He hath triumphed; The horse and its rider He hath thrown into the sea!'"
2015022,2,15,22,"And Moses causeth Israel to journey from the Red Sea, and they go out unto the wilderness of Shur, and they go three days in the wilderness, and have not found water,"
2015023,2,15,23,"and they come in to Marah, and have not been able to drink the waters of Marah, for they `are' bitter; therefore hath `one' called its name Marah."
2015024,2,15,24,"And the people murmur against Moses, saying, `What do we drink?'"
2015025,2,15,25,"and he crieth unto Jehovah, and Jehovah sheweth him a tree, and he casteth unto the waters, and the waters become sweet. There He hath made for them a statute, and an ordinance, and there He hath tried them,"
2015026,2,15,26,"and He saith, `If thou dost really hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and dost that which is right in His eyes, and hast hearkened to His commands, and kept all His statutes: none of the sickness which I laid on the Egyptians do I lay on thee, for I, Jehovah, am healing thee."
2015027,2,15,27,"And they come to Elim, and there `are' twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees; and they encamp there by the waters."
2016001,2,16,1,"And they journey from Elim, and all the company of the sons of Israel come in unto the wilderness of Sin, which `is' between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt."
2016002,2,16,2,And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
2016003,2,16,3,"and the sons of Israel say unto them, `Oh that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, in our sitting by the flesh-pot, in our eating bread to satiety -- for ye have brought us out unto this wilderness to put all this assembly to death with hunger.'"
2016004,2,16,4,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, I am raining to you bread from the heavens -- and the people have gone out and gathered the matter of a day in its day -- so that I try them whether they walk in My law, or not;"
2016005,2,16,5,"and it hath been on the sixth day, that they have prepared that which they bring in, and it hath been double above that which they gather day `by' day.'"
2016006,2,16,6,"And Moses saith -- Aaron also -- unto all the sons of Israel, `Evening -- and ye have known that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;"
2016007,2,16,7,"and morning -- and ye have seen the honour of Jehovah, in His hearing your murmurings against Jehovah, and what `are' we, that ye murmur against us?'"
2016008,2,16,8,"And Moses saith, `In Jehovah's giving to you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety -- in Jehovah's hearing your murmurings, which ye are murmuring against Him, and what `are' we? your murmurings `are' not against us, but against Jehovah.'"
2016009,2,16,9,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Say unto all the company of the sons of Israel, Come ye near before Jehovah, for He hath heard your murmurings;'"
2016010,2,16,10,"and it cometh to pass, when Aaron is speaking unto all the company of the sons of Israel, that they turn towards the wilderness, and lo, the honour of Jehovah is seen in the cloud."
2016011,2,16,11,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2016012,2,16,12,"`I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak unto them, saying, Between the evenings ye eat flesh, and in the morning ye are satisfied `with' bread, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah your God.'"
2016013,2,16,13,"And it cometh to pass in the evening, that the quail cometh up, and covereth the camp, and in the morning there hath been the lying of dew round about the camp,"
2016014,2,16,14,"and the lying of the dew goeth up, and lo, on the face of the wilderness a thin, bare thing, thin as hoar-frost on the earth."
2016015,2,16,15,"And the sons of Israel see, and say one unto another, `What `is' it?' for they have not known what it `is'; and Moses saith unto them, `It `is' the bread which Jehovah hath given to you for food."
2016016,2,16,16,"`This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded: Gather of it each according to his eating, an omer for a poll; and the number of your persons, take ye each for those in his tent.'"
2016017,2,16,17,"And the sons of Israel do so, and they gather, he who is `gathering' much, and he who is `gathering' little;"
2016018,2,16,18,"and they measure with an omer, and he who is `gathering' much hath nothing over, and he who is `gathering' little hath no lack, each according to his eating they have gathered."
2016019,2,16,19,"And Moses saith unto them, `Let no man leave of it till morning;'"
2016020,2,16,20,"and they have not hearkened unto Moses, and some of them do leave of it till morning, and it bringeth up worms and stinketh; and Moses is wroth with them."
2016021,2,16,21,"And they gather it morning by morning, each according to his eating; when the sun hath been warm, then it hath melted."
2016022,2,16,22,"And it cometh to pass on the sixth day, they have gathered a second bread, two omers for one, and all the princes of the company come in, and declare to Moses."
2016023,2,16,23,"And he saith unto them, `It `is' that which Jehovah hath spoken `of'; a rest -- a holy sabbath to Jehovah -- `is' to-morrow; that which ye bake, bake; and that which ye boil, boil; and all that is over, let rest for yourselves in charge till the morning.'"
2016024,2,16,24,"And they let it rest until the morning, as Moses hath commanded, and it hath not stank, and a worm hath not been in it."
2016025,2,16,25,"And Moses saith, `Eat it to-day, for to-day `is' a sabbath to Jehovah; to-day ye find it not in the field:"
2016026,2,16,26,"six days ye do gather it, and in the seventh day -- the sabbath -- in it there is none.'"
2016027,2,16,27,"And it cometh to pass on the seventh day, some of the people have gone out to gather, and have not found."
2016028,2,16,28,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `How long have ye refused to keep My commands, and My laws?"
2016029,2,16,29,"see, because Jehovah hath given to you the sabbath, therefore He is giving to you on the sixth day bread of two days; abide ye each `in' his place, no one doth go out from his place on the seventh day.'"
2016030,2,16,30,"And the people rest on the seventh day,"
2016031,2,16,31,"and the house of Israel call its name Manna, and it `is' as coriander seed, white; and its taste `is' as a cake with honey."
2016032,2,16,32,"And Moses saith, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded: Fill the omer with it, for a charge for your generations, so that they see the bread which I have caused you to eat in the wilderness, in My bringing you out from the land of Egypt.'"
2016033,2,16,33,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take one pot, and put there the fulness of the omer of manna, and let it rest before Jehovah, for a charge for your generations;'"
2016034,2,16,34,"as Jehovah hath given commandment unto Moses, so doth Aaron let it rest before the Testimony, for a charge."
2016035,2,16,35,"And the sons of Israel have eaten the manna forty years, until their coming in unto the land to be inhabited; the manna they have eaten till their coming in unto the extremity of the land of Canaan."
2016036,2,16,36,and the omer is a tenth of the ephah.
2017001,2,17,1,"And all the company of the sons of Israel journey from the wilderness of Sin, on their journeyings, by the command of Jehovah, and encamp in Rephidim, and there is no water for the people to drink;"
2017002,2,17,2,"and the people strive with Moses, and say, `Give us water, and we drink.' And Moses saith to them, `What? -- ye strive with me, what? -- ye try Jehovah?'"
2017003,2,17,3,"and the people thirst there for water, and the people murmur against Moses, and say, `Why `is' this? -- thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to put us to death, also our sons and our cattle, with thirst.'"
2017004,2,17,4,"And Moses crieth to Jehovah, saying, `What do I to this people? yet a little, and they have stoned me.'"
2017005,2,17,5,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Pass over before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy rod with which thou hast smitten the River take in thy hand, and thou hast gone:"
2017006,2,17,6,"Lo, I am standing before thee there on the rock in Horeb, and thou hast smitten on the rock, and waters have come out from it, and the people have drunk.' And Moses doth so before the eyes of the elders of Israel,"
2017007,2,17,7,"and he calleth the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the `strife' of the sons of Israel, and because of their `trying' Jehovah, saying, `Is Jehovah in our midst or not?'"
2017008,2,17,8,"And Amalek cometh, and fighteth with Israel in Rephidim,"
2017009,2,17,9,"and Moses saith unto Joshua, `Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I am standing on the top of the hill, and the rod of God in my hand.'"
2017010,2,17,10,"And Joshua doth as Moses hath said to him, to fight with Amalek, and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, have gone up `to' the top of the height;"
2017011,2,17,11,"and it hath come to pass, when Moses lifteth up his hand, that Israel hath been mighty, and when he letteth his hands rest, that Amalek hath been mighty."
2017012,2,17,12,"And the hands of Moses `are' heavy, and they take a stone, and set `it' under him, and he sitteth on it: and Aaron and Hur have taken hold on his hands, on this side one, and on that one, and his hands are stedfast till the going in of the sun;"
2017013,2,17,13,and Joshua weakeneth Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.
2017014,2,17,14,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Write this, a memorial in a Book, and set `it' in the ears of Joshua, that I do utterly wipe away the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens;'"
2017015,2,17,15,"and Moses buildeth an altar, and calleth its name Jehovah-Nissi,"
2017016,2,17,16,"and saith, `Because a hand `is' on the throne of Jah, war `is' to Jehovah with Amalek from generation -- generation.'"
2018001,2,18,1,"And Jethro priest of Midian, father-in-law of Moses, heareth all that God hath done for Moses, and for Israel his people, that Jehovah hath brought out Israel from Egypt,"
2018002,2,18,2,"and Jethro, father-in-law of Moses, taketh Zipporah, wife of Moses, besides her parents,"
2018003,2,18,3,"and her two sons, of whom the name of the one `is' Gershom, for he said, `a sojourner I have been in a strange land:'"

2018009,2,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiceth for all the good which Jehovah hath done to Israel, whom He hath delivered from the hand of the Egyptians;"

2018013,2,18,13,"And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that Moses sitteth to judge the people, and the people stand before Moses, from the morning unto the evening;"

2018019,2,18,19,"`Now, hearken to my voice, I counsel thee, and God is with thee: be thou for the people over-against God, and thou hast brought in the things unto God;"
2018020,2,18,20,"and thou hast warned them `concerning' the statutes and the laws, and hast made known to them the way in which they go, and the work which they do."
2018021,2,18,21,"`And thou -- thou dost provide out of all the people men of ability, fearing God, men of truth, hating dishonest gain, and hast placed `these' over them, heads of thousands, heads of hundreds, heads of fifties, and heads of tens,"
2018022,2,18,22,"and they have judged the people at all times; and it hath come to pass, every great matter they bring in unto thee, and every small matter they judge themselves; and lighten it from off thyself, and they have borne with thee."
2018023,2,18,23,"If thou dost this thing, and God hath commanded thee, then thou hast been able to stand, and all this people also goeth in unto its place in peace.'"
2018024,2,18,24,"And Moses hearkeneth to the voice of his father-in-law, and doth all that he said,"
2018025,2,18,25,"and Moses chooseth men of ability out of all Israel, and maketh them chiefs over the people, heads of thousands, heads of hundreds, heads of fifties, and heads of tens,"
2018026,2,18,26,"and they have judged the people at all times; the hard matter they bring in unto Moses, and every small matter they judge themselves."
2018027,2,18,27,"And Moses sendeth his father-in-law away, and he goeth away unto his own land."
2019001,2,19,1,"In the third month of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in this day they have come into the wilderness of Sinai,"
2019002,2,19,2,"and they journey from Rephidim, and enter the wilderness of Sinai, and encamp in the wilderness; and Israel encampeth there before the mount."
2019003,2,19,3,"And Moses hath gone up unto God, and Jehovah calleth unto him out of the mount, saying, `Thus dost thou say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel,"

2019007,2,19,7,"And Moses cometh, and calleth for the elders of the people, and setteth before them all these words which Jehovah hath commanded him;"
2019008,2,19,8,"and all the people answer together and say, `All that Jehovah hath spoken we do;' and Moses returneth the words of the people unto Jehovah."
2019009,2,19,9,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, I am coming unto thee in the thickness of the cloud, so that the people hear in My speaking with thee, and also believe in thee to the age;' and Moses declareth the words of the people unto Jehovah."
2019010,2,19,10,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go unto the people; and thou hast sanctified them to-day and to-morrow, and they have washed their garments,"
2019011,2,19,11,"and have been prepared for the third day; for on the third day doth Jehovah come down before the eyes of all the people, on mount Sinai."
2019012,2,19,12,"`And thou hast made a border `for' the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, going up into the mount, or coming against its extremity; whoever is coming against the mount is certainly put to death;"
2019013,2,19,13,"a hand cometh not against him, for he is certainly stoned or shot through, whether beast or man it liveth not; in the drawing out of the jubilee cornet they go up into the mount.'"
2019014,2,19,14,"And Moses cometh down from the mount unto the people, and sanctifieth the people, and they wash their garments;"
2019015,2,19,15,"and he saith unto the people, `Be ye prepared for the third day, come not nigh unto a woman.'"
2019016,2,19,16,"And it cometh to pass, on the third day, while it is morning, that there are voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud, on the mount, and the sound of a trumpet very strong; and all the people who `are' in the camp do tremble."
2019017,2,19,17,"And Moses bringeth out the people to meet God from the camp, and they station themselves at the lower part of the mount,"
2019018,2,19,18,"and mount Sinai `is' wholly a smoke from the presence of Jehovah, who hath come down on it in fire, and its smoke goeth up as smoke of the furnace, and the whole mount trembleth exceedingly;"
2019019,2,19,19,"and the sound of the trumpet is going on, and very strong; Moses speaketh, and God doth answer him with a voice."
2019020,2,19,20,"And Jehovah cometh down on mount Sinai, unto the top of the mount, and Jehovah calleth for Moses unto the top of the mount, and Moses goeth up."
2019021,2,19,21,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go down, protest to the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them have fallen;"
2019022,2,19,22,"and also the priests who are coming nigh unto Jehovah do sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.'"
2019023,2,19,23,"And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `The people `is' unable to come up unto mount Sinai, for Thou -- Thou hast protested to us, saying, Make a border `for' the mount, then thou hast sanctified it.'"
2019024,2,19,24,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `Go, descend, then thou hast come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; and the priests and the people do not break through, to come up unto Jehovah, lest He break forth upon them.'"
2019025,2,19,25,"And Moses goeth down unto the people, and saith unto them: --"

2020005,2,20,5,"Thou dost not bow thyself to them, nor serve them: for I, Jehovah thy God, `am' a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third `generation', and on the fourth, of those hating Me,"
2020006,2,20,6,"and doing kindness to thousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands."
2020007,2,20,7,"`Thou dost not take up the name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing, for Jehovah acquitteth not him who taketh up His name for a vain thing."

2020011,2,20,11,"for six days hath Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that `is' in them, and resteth in the seventh day; therefore hath Jehovah blessed the Sabbath-day, and doth sanctify it."

2020021,2,20,21,"And the people stand afar off, and Moses hath drawn nigh unto the thick darkness where God `is'."
2020022,2,20,22,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Thus dost thou say unto the sons of Israel: Ye -- ye have seen that from the heavens I have spoken with you;"

2021010,2,21,10,"`If another `woman' he take for him, her food, her covering, and her habitation, he doth not withdraw;"

2023015,2,23,15,"the Feast of Unleavened things thou dost keep; seven days thou dost eat unleavened things, as I have commanded thee, at the time appointed `in' the month of Abib; for in it thou hast come forth out of Egypt, and ye do not appear `in' My presence empty;"
2023016,2,23,16,"and the Feast of Harvest, the first fruits of thy works which thou sowest in the field; and the Feast of the In-Gathering, in the outgoing of the year, in thy gathering thy works out of the field."
2023017,2,23,17,`Three times in a year do all thy males appear before the face of the Lord Jehovah.
2023018,2,23,18,"`Thou dost not sacrifice on a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice, and the fat of My festival doth not remain till morning;"
2023019,2,23,19,the beginning of the first-fruits of thy ground thou dost bring into the house of Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
2023020,2,23,20,"`Lo, I am sending a messenger before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee in unto the place which I have prepared;"
2023021,2,23,21,"be watchful because of his presence, and hearken to his voice, rebel not against him, for he beareth not with your transgression, for My name `is' in his heart;"
2023022,2,23,22,"for, if thou diligently hearken to his voice, and hast done all that which I speak, then I have been at enmity with thine enemies, and have distressed those distressing thee."
2023023,2,23,23,"`For My messenger goeth before thee, and hath brought thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I have cut them off."
2023024,2,23,24,"`Thou dost not bow thyself to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their doings, but dost utterly devote them, and thoroughly break their standing pillars."
2023025,2,23,25,"`And ye have served Jehovah your God, and He hath blessed thy bread and thy water, and I have turned aside sickness from thine heart;"
2023026,2,23,26,there is not a miscarrying and barren one in thy land; the number of thy days I fulfil:
2023027,2,23,27,"My terror I send before thee, and I have put to death all the people among whom thou comest, and I have given the neck of all thine enemies unto thee."
2023028,2,23,28,"`And I have sent the hornet before thee, and it hath cast out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee;"
2023029,2,23,29,"I cast them not out from before thee in one year, lest the land be a desolation, and the beast of the field hath multiplied against thee;"
2023030,2,23,30,"little `by' little I cast them out from before thee, till thou art fruitful, and hast inherited the land."
2023031,2,23,31,"`And I have set thy border from the Red Sea, even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I give into your hand the inhabitants of the land, and thou hast cast them out from before thee;"
2023032,2,23,32,"thou dost not make a covenant with them, and with their gods;"
2023033,2,23,33,"they do not dwell in thy land, lest they cause thee to sin against Me when thou servest their gods, when it becometh a snare to thee.'"
2024001,2,24,1,"And unto Moses He said, `Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and ye have bowed yourselves afar off;'"
2024002,2,24,2,"and Moses hath drawn nigh by himself unto Jehovah; and they draw not nigh, and the people go not up with him."
2024003,2,24,3,"And Moses cometh in, and recounteth to the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments, and all the people answer -- one voice, and say, `All the words which Jehovah hath spoken we do.'"
2024004,2,24,4,"And Moses writeth all the words of Jehovah, and riseth early in the morning, and buildeth an altar under the hill, and twelve standing pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel;"
2024005,2,24,5,"and he sendeth the youths of the sons of Israel, and they cause burnt-offerings to ascend, and sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings to Jehovah -- calves."
2024006,2,24,6,"And Moses taketh half of the blood, and putteth in basins, and half of the blood hath he sprinkled on the altar;"
2024007,2,24,7,"and he taketh the Book of the Covenant, and proclaimeth in the ears of the people, and they say, `All that which Jehovah hath spoken we do, and obey.'"
2024008,2,24,8,"And Moses taketh the blood, and sprinkleth on the people, and saith, `Lo, the blood of the covenant which Jehovah hath made with you, concerning all these things.'"
2024009,2,24,9,"And Moses goeth up, Aaron also, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,"
2024010,2,24,10,"and they see the God of Israel, and under His feet `is' as the white work of the sapphire, and as the substance of the heavens for purity;"
2024011,2,24,11,"and unto those of the sons of Israel who are near He hath not put forth His hand, and they see God, and eat and drink."
2024012,2,24,12,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Come up unto Me to the mount, and be there, and I give to thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the command, which I have written to direct them.'"
2024013,2,24,13,And Moses riseth -- Joshua his minister also -- and Moses goeth up unto the mount of God;
2024014,2,24,14,"and unto the elders he hath said, `Abide ye for us in this `place', until that we turn back unto you, and lo, Aaron and Hur `are' with you -- he who hath matters doth come nigh unto them.'"
2024015,2,24,15,"And Moses goeth up unto the mount, and the cloud covereth the mount;"
2024016,2,24,16,"and the honour of Jehovah doth tabernacle on mount Sinai, and the cloud covereth it six days, and He calleth unto Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud."
2024017,2,24,17,"And the appearance of the honour of Jehovah `is' as a consuming fire on the top of the mount, before the eyes of the sons of Israel;"
2024018,2,24,18,"and Moses goeth into the midst of the cloud, and goeth up unto the mount, and Moses is on the mount forty days and forty nights."
2025001,2,25,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2025002,2,25,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they take for Me a heave-offering; from every man whose heart impelleth him ye do take My heave-offering."
2025003,2,25,3,"`And this `is' the heave-offering which ye take from them; gold, and silver, and brass,"
2025004,2,25,4,"and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' `hair',"
2025005,2,25,5,"and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,"

2025008,2,25,8,"`And they have made for Me a sanctuary, and I have tabernacled in their midst;"
2025009,2,25,9,"according to all that which I am shewing thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its vessels, even so ye do make `it'."
2025010,2,25,10,"`And they have made an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;"
2025011,2,25,11,"and thou hast overlaid it `with' pure gold, within and without thou dost overlay it, and thou hast made on it a ring of gold round about."
2025012,2,25,12,"`And thou hast cast for it four rings of gold, and hast put `them' on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;"
2025013,2,25,13,"and thou hast made staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them `with' gold,"
2025014,2,25,14,"and hast brought the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark by them,"
2025015,2,25,15,"in the rings of the ark are the staves, they are not turned aside from it;"
2025016,2,25,16,and thou hast put unto the ark the testimony which I give unto thee.
2025017,2,25,17,"`And thou hast made a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;"
2025018,2,25,18,"and thou hast made two cherubs of gold, beaten work dost thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;"
2025019,2,25,19,"and make thou one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that; at the mercy-seat ye do make the cherubs on its two ends."
2025020,2,25,20,"`And the cherubs have been spreading out wings on high, covering the mercy-seat over with their wings, and their faces `are' one towards another -- towards the mercy-seat are the faces of the cherubs."
2025021,2,25,21,"`And thou hast put the mercy-seat on the ark above, and unto the ark thou dost put the testimony which I give unto thee;"
2025022,2,25,22,"and I have met with thee there, and have spoken with thee from off the mercy-seat (from between the two cherubs, which `are' on the ark of the testimony) all that which I command thee concerning the sons of Israel."
2025023,2,25,23,"`And thou hast made a table of shittim wood, two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,"
2025024,2,25,24,"and hast overlaid it `with' pure gold, and hast made for it a crown of gold round about,"
2025025,2,25,25,"and hast made for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and hast made a crown of gold to its border round about."
2025026,2,25,26,"`And thou hast made to it four rings of gold, and hast put the rings on the four corners, which `are' to its four feet;"
2025027,2,25,27,over-against the border are the rings for places for staves to bear the table;
2025028,2,25,28,"and thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold, and the table hath been borne with them;"
2025029,2,25,29,"and thou hast made its dishes, and its bowls, and its covers, and its cups, with which they pour out; of pure gold thou dost make them;"
2025030,2,25,30,and thou hast put on the table bread of the presence before Me continually.
2025031,2,25,31,"`And thou hast made a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work is the candlestick made; its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers are of the same;"

2028028,2,28,28,"and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, to be above the girdle of the ephod, and the breastplate is not loosed from the ephod."
2028029,2,28,29,"`And Aaron hath borne the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate of judgment, on his heart, in his going in unto the sanctuary, for a memorial before Jehovah continually."
2028030,2,28,30,"`And thou hast put unto the breastplate of judgment the Lights and the Perfections, and they have been on the heart of Aaron, in his going in before Jehovah, and Aaron hath borne the judgment of the sons of Israel on his heart before Jehovah continually."
2028031,2,28,31,"`And thou hast made the upper robe of the ephod completely of blue,"
2028032,2,28,32,"and the opening for its head hath been in its midst, a border is to its opening round about, work of a weaver, as the opening of a habergeon there is to it; it is not rent."
2028033,2,28,33,"`And thou hast made on its hem pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, on its hem round about, and bells of gold in their midst round about;"
2028034,2,28,34,"a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate `are' on the hems of the upper robe round about."
2028035,2,28,35,"`And it hath been on Aaron to minister in, and its sound hath been heard in his coming in unto the sanctuary before Jehovah, and in his going out, and he doth not die."
2028036,2,28,36,"`And thou hast made a flower of pure gold, and hast opened on it -- openings of a signet -- `Holy to Jehovah;'"
2028037,2,28,37,"and thou hast put it on a blue ribbon, and it hath been on the mitre -- over-against the front of the mitre it is;"
2028038,2,28,38,"and it hath been on the forehead of Aaron, and Aaron hath borne the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel do hallow, even all their holy gifts; and it hath been on his forehead continually for a pleasing thing for them before Jehovah."
2028039,2,28,39,"`And thou hast embroidered the coat of linen, and hast made a mitre of linen, and a girdle thou dost make -- work of an embroiderer."
2028040,2,28,40,"`And for the sons of Aaron thou dost make coats, and thou hast made for them girdles, yea, bonnets thou dost make for them, for honour and for beauty;"
2028041,2,28,41,"and thou hast clothed Aaron thy brother with them, and his sons with him, and hast anointed them, and hast consecrated their hand, and hast sanctified them, and they have been priests to Me."
2028042,2,28,42,`And make thou for them linen trousers to cover the naked flesh: they are from the loins even unto the thighs;
2028043,2,28,43,"and they have been on Aaron and on his sons, in their going in unto the tent of meeting, or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister in the sanctuary, and they do not bear iniquity nor have they died; a statute age-during to him, and to his seed after him."
2029001,2,29,1,"`And this `is' the thing which thou dost to them, to hallow them, for being priests to Me: Take one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams, perfect ones,"
2029002,2,29,2,"and bread unleavened, and cakes unleavened anointed with oil, of fine wheaten flour thou dost make them,"
2029003,2,29,3,"and thou hast put them on one basket, and hast brought them near in the basket, also the bullock and the two rams."
2029004,2,29,4,"`And Aaron and his sons thou dost bring near unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and hast bathed them with water;"
2029005,2,29,5,"and thou hast taken the garments, and hast clothed Aaron with the coat, and the upper robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and hast girded him with the girdle of the ephod,"
2029006,2,29,6,"and hast set the mitre on his head, and hast put the holy crown on the mitre,"
2029007,2,29,7,"and hast taken the anointing oil, and hast poured `it' on his head, and hast anointed him."
2029008,2,29,8,"`And his sons thou dost bring near, and hast clothed them `with' coats,"
2029009,2,29,9,"and hast girded them `with' a girdle (Aaron and his sons), and hast bound on them bonnets; and the priesthood hath been theirs by a statute age-during, and thou hast consecrated the hand of Aaron, and the hand of his sons,"
2029010,2,29,10,"and hast brought near the bullock before the tent of meeting, and Aaron hath laid -- his sons also -- their hands on the head of the bullock."
2029011,2,29,11,"`And thou hast slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting,"
2029012,2,29,12,"and hast taken of the blood of the bullock, and hast put `it' on the horns of the altar with thy finger, and all the blood thou dost pour out at the foundation of the altar;"
2029013,2,29,13,"and thou hast taken all the fat which is covering the inwards, and the redundance on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, and hast made perfume on the altar;"
2029014,2,29,14,"and the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, thou dost burn with fire at the outside of the camp; it `is' a sin-offering."
2029015,2,29,15,"`And the one ram thou dost take, and Aaron and his sons have laid their hands on the head of the ram,"
2029016,2,29,16,"and thou hast slaughtered the ram, and hast taken its blood, and hast sprinkled `it' on the altar round about,"
2029017,2,29,17,"and the ram thou dost cut into its pieces, and hast washed its inwards, and its legs, and hast put `them' on its pieces, and on its head;"
2029018,2,29,18,"and thou hast made perfume with the whole ram on the altar. It `is' a burnt-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance; a fire-offering it `is' to Jehovah."
2029019,2,29,19,"`And thou hast taken the second ram, and Aaron hath laid -- his sons also -- their hands on the head of the ram,"
2029020,2,29,20,"and thou hast slaughtered the ram, and hast taken of its blood, and hast put on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and hast sprinkled the blood on the altar round about;"
2029021,2,29,21,"and thou hast taken of the blood which `is' on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and hast sprinkled on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he hath been hallowed, he, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him."
2029022,2,29,22,"`And thou hast taken from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the inwards, and the redundance on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, and the right leg, for it `is' a ram of consecration,"
2029023,2,29,23,"and one round cake of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake out of the basket of the unleavened things which `is' before Jehovah."
2029024,2,29,24,"`And thou hast set the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and hast waved them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah;"
2029025,2,29,25,"and thou hast taken them out of their hand, and hast made perfume on the altar beside the burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance before Jehovah; a fire-offering it `is' to Jehovah."
2029026,2,29,26,"`And thou hast taken the breast from the ram of the consecration which `is' for Aaron, and hast waved it -- a wave-offering before Jehovah, and it hath become thy portion;"
2029027,2,29,27,"and thou hast sanctified the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, which hath been waved, and which hath been lifted up from the ram of the consecration, of that which `is' for Aaron, and of that which `is' for his sons;"
2029028,2,29,28,"and it hath been for Aaron and for his sons, by a statute age-during from the sons of Israel, for it `is' a heave-offering; and it is a heave offering from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings -- their heave-offering to Jehovah."
2029029,2,29,29,"`And the holy garments which are Aaron's, are for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to consecrate in them their hand;"
2029030,2,29,30,"seven days doth the priest in his stead (of his sons) put them on, when he goeth in unto the tent of meeting, to minister in the sanctuary."
2029031,2,29,31,"`And the ram of the consecration thou dost take, and hast boiled its flesh in the holy place;"
2029032,2,29,32,"and Aaron hath eaten -- his sons also -- the flesh of the ram, and the bread which `is' in the basket, at the opening of the tent of meeting;"
2029033,2,29,33,"and they have eaten those things by which there is atonement to consecrate their hand, to sanctify them; and a stranger doth not eat -- for they `are' holy;"
2029034,2,29,34,"and if there be left of the flesh of the consecration or of the bread till the morning, then thou hast burned that which is left with fire; it is not eaten, for it `is' holy."
2029035,2,29,35,"`And thou hast done thus to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days thou dost consecrate their hand;"
2029036,2,29,36,"and a bullock, a sin-offering, thou dost prepare daily for the atonements, and thou hast atoned for the altar, in thy making atonement on it, and hast anointed it to sanctify it;"
2029037,2,29,37,"seven days thou dost make atonement for the altar, and hast sanctified it, and the altar hath been most holy; all that is coming against the altar is holy."
2029038,2,29,38,"`And this `is' that which thou dost prepare on the altar; two lambs, sons of a year, daily continually;"
2029039,2,29,39,"the one lamb thou dost prepare in the morning, and the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings;"
2029040,2,29,40,"and a tenth `deal' of fine flour, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin, and a libation, a fourth part of a hin, of wine, `is' for the one lamb."
2029041,2,29,41,"`And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; according to the present of the morning, and according to its libation, thou dost prepare for it, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering, to Jehovah: --"
2029042,2,29,42,"a continual burnt-offering for your generations, at the opening of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah, whither I am met with you, to speak unto thee there,"
2029043,2,29,43,"and I have met there with the sons of Israel, and it hath been sanctified by My honour."
2029044,2,29,44,"`And I have sanctified the tent of meeting, and the altar, and Aaron and his sons I sanctify for being priests to Me,"
2029045,2,29,45,"and I have tabernacled in the midst of the sons of Israel, and have become their God,"
2029046,2,29,46,"and they have known that I `am' Jehovah their God, who hath brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I may tabernacle in their midst; I `am' Jehovah their God."
2030001,2,30,1,`And thou hast made an altar `for' making perfume; `of' shittim wood thou dost make it;
2030002,2,30,2,"a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns `are' of the same."
2030003,2,30,3,"`And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a crown of gold round about;"
2030004,2,30,4,"and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make `them', on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them."
2030005,2,30,5,"`And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold;"
2030006,2,30,6,"and thou hast put it before the vail, which `is' by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which `is' over the testimony, whither I am met with thee."
2030007,2,30,7,"`And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth perfume it,"
2030008,2,30,8,"and in Aaron's causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before Jehovah to your generations."
2030009,2,30,9,"`Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it;"
2030010,2,30,10,"and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it `is' most holy to Jehovah.'"
2030011,2,30,11,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2030012,2,30,12,"`When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers, then they have given each an atonement `for' his soul to Jehovah in their being numbered, and there is no plague among them in their being numbered."
2030013,2,30,13,"`This they do give, every one passing over unto those numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel `is' twenty gerahs); half a shekel `is' the heave-offering to Jehovah;"
2030014,2,30,14,"every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, doth give the heave-offering of Jehovah;"
2030015,2,30,15,"the rich doth not multiply, and the poor doth not diminish from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls."
2030016,2,30,16,"`And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of meeting; and it hath been to the sons of Israel for a memorial before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.'"
2030017,2,30,17,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2030018,2,30,18,"`And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass), for washing; and thou hast put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;"
2030019,2,30,19,"and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet,"
2030020,2,30,20,"in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash `with' water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Jehovah,"
2030021,2,30,21,"then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they die not, and it hath been to them a statute age-during, to him and to his seed to their generations.'"
2030022,2,30,22,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2030023,2,30,23,"`And thou, take to thyself principal spices, wild honey five hundred `shekels'; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that, two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;"
2030024,2,30,24,"and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary, and olive oil a hin;"
2030025,2,30,25,"and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil."
2030026,2,30,26,"`And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,"
2030027,2,30,27,"and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of perfume,"
2030028,2,30,28,"and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;"
2030029,2,30,29,"and thou hast sanctified them, and they have been most holy; all that is coming against them is holy;"
2030030,2,30,30,"and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint, and hast sanctified them for being priests to Me."
2030031,2,30,31,"`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, A holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;"
2030032,2,30,32,"on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper proportion ye make none like it; it `is' holy; it is holy to you;"
2030033,2,30,33,"a man who compoundeth `any' like it, or who putteth of it on a stranger -- hath even been cut off from his people.'"
2030034,2,30,34,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Take to thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; they are part for part;"
2030035,2,30,35,"and thou hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a compounder, salted, pure, holy;"
2030036,2,30,36,"and thou hast beaten `some' of it small, and hast put of it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am met with thee; most holy it is to you."
2030037,2,30,37,"`As to the perfume which thou makest, with its proper proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to Jehovah;"
2030038,2,30,38,a man who maketh `any' like it -- to be refreshed by it -- hath even been cut off from his people.'
2031001,2,31,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2031002,2,31,2,"`See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,"
2031003,2,31,3,"and I fill him `with' the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,"
2031004,2,31,4,"to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,"
2031005,2,31,5,"and in graving of stone for settings, and in graving of wood to work in all work."
2031006,2,31,6,"`And I, lo, I have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom, and they have made all that which I have commanded thee."
2031007,2,31,7,"`The tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy-seat which `is' on it, and all the vessels of the tent,"
2031008,2,31,8,"and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick and all its vessels, and the altar of the perfume,"
2031009,2,31,9,"and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,"
2031010,2,31,10,"and the coloured garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in;"
2031011,2,31,11,"and the anointing oil, and the perfume of the spices for the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee -- they do.'"
2031012,2,31,12,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2031013,2,31,13,"`And thou, speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Only, My sabbaths ye do keep, for it `is' a sign between Me and you, to your generations, to know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you;"
2031014,2,31,14,"and ye have kept the sabbath, for it `is' holy to you, he who is polluting it is certainly put to death -- for any who doeth work in it -- that person hath even been cut off from the midst of his people."
2031015,2,31,15,"`Six days is work done, and in the seventh day `is' a sabbath of holy rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in the sabbath-day is certainly put to death,"
2031016,2,31,16,"and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations `is' a covenant age-during,"
2031017,2,31,17,"between Me and the sons of Israel it `is' a sign -- to the age; for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He hath ceased, and is refreshed.'"
2031018,2,31,18,"And He giveth unto Moses, when He finisheth speaking with him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God."
2032001,2,32,1,"And the people see that Moses is delaying to come down from the mount, and the people assemble against Aaron, and say unto him, `Rise, make for us gods who go before us, for this Moses -- the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt -- we have not known what hath happened to him.'"
2032002,2,32,2,"And Aaron saith unto them, `Break off the rings of gold which `are' in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring in unto me;'"
2032003,2,32,3,"and all the people themselves break off the rings of gold which `are' in their ears, and bring in unto Aaron,"
2032004,2,32,4,"and he receiveth from their hand, and doth fashion it with a graving tool, and doth make it a molten calf, and they say, `These thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'"
2032005,2,32,5,"And Aaron seeth, and buildeth an altar before it, and Aaron calleth, and saith, `A festival to Jehovah -- to-morrow;'"
2032006,2,32,6,"and they rise early on the morrow, and cause burnt-offerings to ascend, and bring nigh peace-offerings; and the people sit down to eat and to drink, and rise up to play."
2032007,2,32,7,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go, descend, for thy people whom thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt hath done corruptly,"
2032008,2,32,8,"they have turned aside hastily from the way that I have commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and bow themselves to it, and sacrifice to it, and say, These thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'"
2032009,2,32,9,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `I have seen this people, and lo, it `is' a stiff-necked people;"
2032010,2,32,10,"and now, let Me alone, and My anger doth burn against them, and I consume them, and I make thee become a great nation.'"
2032011,2,32,11,"And Moses appeaseth the face of Jehovah his God, and saith, `Why, O Jehovah, doth Thine anger burn against Thy people, whom Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?"
2032012,2,32,12,"why do the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil He brought them out to slay them among mountains, and to consume them from off the face of the ground? turn back from the heat of Thine anger, and repent of the evil against Thy people."
2032013,2,32,13,"`Be mindful of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou hast sworn by Thyself, and unto whom Thou speakest: I multiply your seed as stars of the heavens, and all this land, as I have said, I give to your seed, and they have inherited to the age;'"
2032014,2,32,14,and Jehovah repenteth of the evil which He hath spoken of doing to His people.
2032015,2,32,15,"And Moses turneth, and goeth down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony `are' in his hand, tables written on both their sides, on this and on that `are' they written;"
2032016,2,32,16,"and the tables are the work of God, and the writing is the writing of God, graven on the tables."
2032017,2,32,17,"And Joshua heareth the voice of the people in their shouting, and saith unto Moses, `A noise of battle in the camp!'"
2032018,2,32,18,"and he saith, `It is not the voice of the crying of might, nor is it the voice of the crying of weakness -- a voice of singing I am hearing.'"
2032019,2,32,19,"And it cometh to pass, when he hath drawn near unto the camp, that he seeth the calf, and the dancing, and the anger of Moses burneth, and he casteth out of his hands the tables, and breaketh them under the mount;"
2032020,2,32,20,"and he taketh the calf which they have made, and burneth `it' with fire, and grindeth until `it is' small, and scattereth on the face of the waters, and causeth the sons of Israel to drink."
2032021,2,32,21,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, `What hath this people done to thee, that thou hast brought in upon it a great sin?'"
2032022,2,32,22,"and Aaron saith, `Let not the anger of my lord burn; thou -- thou hast known the people that it `is' in evil;"
2032023,2,32,23,"and they say to me, Make for us gods, who go before us, for this Moses -- the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt -- we have not known what hath happened to him;"
2032024,2,32,24,"and I say to them, Whoso hath gold, let them break `it' off, and they give to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf cometh out.'"
2032025,2,32,25,"And Moses seeth the people that it `is' unbridled, for Aaron hath made it unbridled for contempt among its withstanders,"
2032026,2,32,26,"and Moses standeth in the gate of the camp, and saith, `Who `is' for Jehovah? -- unto me!' and all the sons of Levi are gathered unto him;"
2032027,2,32,27,"and he saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Put each his sword by his thigh, pass over and turn back from gate to gate through the camp, and slay each his brother, and each his friend, and each his relation.'"
2032028,2,32,28,"And the sons of Levi do according to the word of Moses, and there fall of the people on that day about three thousand men,"
2032029,2,32,29,"and Moses saith, `Consecrate your hand to-day to Jehovah, for a man `is' against his son, and against his brother, so as to bring on you to-day a blessing.'"
2032030,2,32,30,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Moses saith unto the people, `Ye -- ye have sinned a great sin, and now I go up unto Jehovah, if so be I atone for your sin.'"
2032031,2,32,31,"And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah, and saith, `Oh this people hath sinned a great sin, that they make to themselves a god of gold;"
2032032,2,32,32,"and now, if Thou takest away their sin -- and if not -- blot me, I pray thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.'"
2032033,2,32,33,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Whoso hath sinned against Me -- I blot him out of My book;"
2032034,2,32,34,"and now, go, lead the people whithersoever I have spoken to thee of; lo, My messenger goeth before thee, and in the day of my charging -- then I have charged upon them their sin.'"
2032035,2,32,35,"And Jehovah plagueth the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made."
2033001,2,33,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, `Go, ascend from this `place', thou and the people, whom thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed I give it,'"
2033002,2,33,2,"(and I have sent before thee a messenger, and have cast out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,)"
2033003,2,33,3,"unto a land flowing with milk and honey, for I do not go up in thy midst, for thou `art' a stiff-necked people -- lest I consume thee in the way.'"
2033004,2,33,4,"And the people hear this sad thing, and mourn; and none put his ornaments on him."
2033005,2,33,5,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Say unto the sons of Israel, Ye `are' a stiff-necked people; one moment -- I come up into thy midst, and have consumed thee; and now, put down thine ornaments from off thee, and I know what I do to thee;'"
2033006,2,33,6,and the sons of Israel take off their ornaments at mount Horeb.
2033007,2,33,7,"And Moses taketh the tent, and hath stretched it out at the outside of the camp, afar off from the camp, and hath called it, `Tent of Meeting;' and it hath come to pass, every one seeking Jehovah goeth out unto the tent of meeting, which `is' at the outside of the camp."
2033008,2,33,8,"And it hath come to pass, at the going out of Moses unto the tent, all the people rise, and have stood, each at the opening of his tent, and have looked expectingly after Moses, until his going into the tent."
2033009,2,33,9,"And it hath come to pass, at the going in of Moses to the tent, the pillar of the cloud cometh down, and hath stood at the opening of the tent, and He hath spoken with Moses;"
2033010,2,33,10,"and all the people have seen the pillar of the cloud standing at the opening of the tent, and all the people have risen and bowed themselves, each at the opening of his tent."
2033011,2,33,11,"And Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses face unto face, as a man speaketh unto his friend; and he hath turned back unto the camp, and his minister Joshua, son of Nun, a youth, departeth not out of the tent."
2033012,2,33,12,"And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `See, Thou art saying unto me, Bring up this people, and Thou hast not caused me to know whom Thou dost send with me; and Thou hast said, I have known thee by name, and also thou hast found grace in Mine eyes."
2033013,2,33,13,"`And now, if, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, cause me to know, I pray Thee, Thy way, and I know Thee, so that I find grace in Thine eyes, and consider that this nation `is' Thy people;'"
2033014,2,33,14,"and He saith, `My presence doth go, and I have given rest to thee.'"
2033015,2,33,15,"And he saith unto Him, `If Thy presence is not going -- take us not up from this `place';"
2033016,2,33,16,"and in what is it known now, that I have found grace in Thine eyes -- I and Thy people -- is it not in Thy going with us? and we have been distinguished -- I and Thy people -- from all the people who `are' on the face of the ground.'"
2033017,2,33,17,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Even this thing which thou hast spoken I do; for thou hast found grace in Mine eyes, and I know thee by name.'"
2033018,2,33,18,"And he saith, `Shew me, I pray Thee, Thine honour;'"
2033019,2,33,19,"and He saith, `I cause all My goodness to pass before thy face, and have called concerning the Name of Jehovah before thee, and favoured him whom I favour, and loved him whom I love.'"
2033020,2,33,20,"He saith also, `Thou art unable to see My face, for man doth not see Me, and live;'"
2033021,2,33,21,"Jehovah also saith, `Lo, a place `is' by Me, and thou hast stood on the rock,"
2033022,2,33,22,"and it hath come to pass, in the passing by of Mine honour, that I have set thee in a cleft of the rock, and spread out My hands over thee, until My passing by,"
2033023,2,33,23,"and I have turned aside My hands, and thou hast seen My back parts, and My face is not seen.'"
2034001,2,34,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Hew for thyself two tables of stone like the first, and I have written on the tables the words which were on the first tables which thou hast broken;"
2034002,2,34,2,"and be prepared at morning, and thou hast come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and hast stood before Me there, on the top of the mount,"
2034003,2,34,3,"and no man cometh up with thee, and also no man is seen in all the mount, also the flock and the herd do not feed over-against that mount.'"
2034004,2,34,4,"And he heweth two tables of stone like the first, and Moses riseth early in the morning, and goeth up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah commanded him, and he taketh in his hand two tables of stone."
2034005,2,34,5,"And Jehovah cometh down in a cloud, and stationeth Himself with him there, and calleth in the Name of Jehovah,"
2034006,2,34,6,"and Jehovah passeth over before his face, and calleth: `Jehovah, Jehovah God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth,"
2034007,2,34,7,"keeping kindness for thousands, taking away iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on children, and on children's children, on a third `generation', and on a fourth.'"
2034008,2,34,8,"And Moses hasteth, and boweth to the earth, and doth obeisance,"
2034009,2,34,9,"and saith, `If, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, O my Lord, let my Lord, I pray Thee, go in our midst (for it `is' a stiff-necked people), and thou hast forgiven our iniquity and our sin, and hast inherited us.'"
2034010,2,34,10,"And He saith, `Lo, I am making a covenant: before all thy people I do wonders, which have not been done in all the earth, or in any nation, and all the people in whose midst thou `art' have seen the work of Jehovah, for it `is' fearful that which I am doing with thee."
2034011,2,34,11,"`Observe for thyself that which I am commanding thee to-day: lo, I am casting out from before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite;"
2034012,2,34,12,"take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land into which thou art going, lest it become a snare in thy midst;"
2034013,2,34,13,"for their altars ye break down, and their standing pillars ye shiver, and its shrines ye cut down;"
2034014,2,34,14,"for ye do not bow yourselves to another god -- for Jehovah, whose name `is' Zealous, is a zealous God."
2034015,2,34,15,"`Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land, and they have gone a-whoring after their gods, and have sacrificed to their gods, and `one' hath called to thee, and thou hast eaten of his sacrifice,"
2034016,2,34,16,"and thou hast taken of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters have gone a-whoring after their gods, and have caused thy sons to go a-whoring after their gods;"
2034017,2,34,17,a molten god thou dost not make to thyself.
2034018,2,34,18,"`The feast of unleavened things thou dost keep; seven days thou dost eat unleavened things, as I have commanded thee, at an appointed time, the month of Abib: for in the month of Abib thou didst come out from Egypt."
2034019,2,34,19,"`All opening a womb `are' Mine, and every firstling of thy cattle born a male, ox or sheep;"
2034020,2,34,20,"and the firstling of an ass thou dost ransom with a lamb; and if thou dost not ransom, then thou hast beheaded it; every first-born of thy sons thou dost ransom, and they do not appear before Me empty."
2034021,2,34,21,"`Six days thou dost work, and on the seventh day thou dost rest; in ploughing-time and in harvest thou dost rest."
2034022,2,34,22,"`And a feast of weeks thou dost observe for thyself; first-fruits of wheat-harvest; and the feast of in-gathering, at the revolution of the year."
2034023,2,34,23,"`Three times in a year do all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, God of Israel;"
2034024,2,34,24,"for I dispossess nations from before thee, and have enlarged thy border, and no man doth desire thy land in thy going up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in a year."
2034025,2,34,25,`Thou dost not slaughter with a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice; and the sacrifice of the feast of the passover doth not remain till morning:
2034026,2,34,26,the first of the first-fruits of the land thou dost bring into the house of Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother's milk.'
2034027,2,34,27,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Write for thyself these words, for, according to the tenor of these words I have made with thee a covenant, and with Israel.'"
2034028,2,34,28,"And he is there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; bread he hath not eaten, and water he hath not drunk; and he writeth on the tables the matters of the covenant -- the ten matters."
2034029,2,34,29,"And it cometh to pass, when Moses is coming down from mount Sinai (and the two tables of the testimony `are' in the hand of Moses in his coming down from the mount), that Moses hath not known that the skin of his face hath shone in His speaking with him,"
2034030,2,34,30,"and Aaron seeth -- all the sons of Israel also -- Moses, and lo, the skin of his face hath shone, and they are afraid of coming nigh unto him."
2034031,2,34,31,"And Moses calleth unto them, and Aaron and all the princes in the company return unto him, and Moses speaketh unto them;"
2034032,2,34,32,"and afterwards have all the sons of Israel come nigh, and he chargeth them with all that Jehovah hath spoken with him in mount Sinai."
2034033,2,34,33,"And Moses finisheth speaking with them, and putteth on his face a vail;"
2034034,2,34,34,"and in the going in of Moses before Jehovah to speak with Him, he turneth aside the vail until his coming out; and he hath come out and hath spoken unto the sons of Israel that which he is commanded;"
2034035,2,34,35,"and the sons of Israel have seen the face of Moses that the skin of the face of Moses hath shone, and Moses hath put back the vail on his face until his going in to speak with Him."
2035001,2,35,1,"And Moses assembleth all the company of the sons of Israel, and saith unto them, `These `are' the things which Jehovah hath commanded -- to do them:"
2035002,2,35,2,"Six days is work done, and on the seventh day there is to you a holy `day', a sabbath of rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in it is put to death;"
2035003,2,35,3,ye do not burn a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath-day.'
2035004,2,35,4,"And Moses speaketh unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,"
2035005,2,35,5,"Take ye from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah; every one whose heart `is' willing doth bring it, -- the heave-offering of Jehovah, -- gold, and silver, and brass,"
2035006,2,35,6,"and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' `hair',"
2035007,2,35,7,"and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,"
2035008,2,35,8,"and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume,"
2035009,2,35,9,"and shoham stones, and stones for settings, for an ephod, and for a breastplate."
2035010,2,35,10,"`And all the wise-hearted among you come in, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:"
2035011,2,35,11,"`The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,"
2035012,2,35,12,"`The ark and its staves, the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,"
2035013,2,35,13,"`The table and its staves, and all its vessels, and the bread of the presence,"
2035014,2,35,14,"`And the candlestick for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light,"
2035015,2,35,15,"`And the altar of perfume, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the spice perfume, and the covering of the opening at the opening of the tabernacle,"
2035016,2,35,16,"`The altar of burnt-offering and the brazen grate which it hath, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,"
2035017,2,35,17,"`The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the covering of the gate of the court,"
2035018,2,35,18,"`The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,"
2035019,2,35,19,"`The coloured garments, to do service in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to act as priest in.'"
2035020,2,35,20,"And all the company of the sons of Israel go out from the presence of Moses,"
2035021,2,35,21,"and they come in -- every man whom his heart hath lifted up, and every one whom his spirit hath made willing -- they have brought in the heave-offering of Jehovah for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments."
2035022,2,35,22,"And they come in -- the men with the women -- every willing-hearted one -- they have brought in nose-ring, and ear-ring, and seal-ring, and necklace, all golden goods, even every one who hath waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah."
2035023,2,35,23,"And every man with whom hath been found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' `hair', and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, have brought `them' in;"
2035024,2,35,24,every one lifting up a heave-offering of silver and brass have brought in the heave-offering of Jehovah; and every one with whom hath been found shittim wood for any work of the service brought `it' in.
2035025,2,35,25,"And every wise-hearted woman hath spun with her hands, and they bring in yarn, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the linen;"
2035026,2,35,26,"and all the women whose heart hath lifted them up in wisdom, have spun the goats' `hair'."
2035027,2,35,27,"And the princes have brought in the shoham stones, and the stones for settings, for the ephod, and for the breastplate,"
2035028,2,35,28,"and the spices, and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume;"
2035029,2,35,29,every man and woman (whom their heart hath made willing to bring in for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses) `of' the sons of Israel brought in a willing-offering to Jehovah.
2035030,2,35,30,"And Moses saith unto the sons of Israel, `See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,"
2035031,2,35,31,"and He doth fill him `with' the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,"
2035032,2,35,32,"even to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,"
2035033,2,35,33,"and in graving of stones for settings, and in graving of wood to work in any work of design."
2035034,2,35,34,"`And to direct He hath put in his heart, he and Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan;"
2035035,2,35,35,"He hath filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work, of engraver, and designer, and embroiderer (in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in linen), and weaver, who do any work, and of designers of designs."
2036001,2,36,1,"And Bezaleel, and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath given wisdom and understanding to know to do every work of the service of the sanctuary, have done according to all that Jehovah commanded."
2036002,2,36,2,"And Moses calleth unto Bezaleel, and unto Aholiab, and unto every wise-hearted man in whose heart Jehovah hath given wisdom, every one whom his heart lifted up, to come near unto the work to do it."
2036003,2,36,3,And they take from before Moses all the heave-offering which the sons of Israel have brought in for the work of the service of the sanctuary to do it; and still they have brought in unto him a willing-offering morning by morning.
2036004,2,36,4,"And all the wise men, who are doing all the work of the sanctuary, come each from his work which they are doing,"
2036005,2,36,5,"and speak unto Moses, saying, `The people are multiplying to bring in more than sufficient for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.'"
2036006,2,36,6,"And Moses commandeth, and they cause a voice to pass over through the camp, saying, `Let not man or woman make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary;' and the people are restrained from bringing,"
2036007,2,36,7,"and the work hath been sufficient for them, for all the work, to do it, and to leave."
2036008,2,36,8,"And all the wise-hearted ones among the doers of the work make the tabernacle; ten curtains of twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, `with' cherubs, work of a designer, he hath made them."
2036009,2,36,9,"The length of the one curtain `is' eight and twenty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain four by the cubit; one measure `is' to all the curtains."
2036010,2,36,10,"And he joineth the five curtains one unto another, and the `other' five curtains he hath joined one unto another;"
2036011,2,36,11,"and he maketh loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, at the end, in the joining; so he hath made in the edge of the outmost curtain, in the joining of the second;"
2036012,2,36,12,"fifty loops he hath made in the one curtain, and fifty loops hath he made in the end of the curtain which `is' in the joining of the second; the loops are taking hold one on another."
2036013,2,36,13,"And he maketh fifty hooks of gold, and joineth the curtains one unto another by the hooks, and the tabernacle is one."
2036014,2,36,14,And he maketh curtains of goats' `hair' for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he hath made them;
2036015,2,36,15,"the length of the one curtain `is' thirty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain `is' four cubits; one measure `is' to the eleven curtains;"
2036016,2,36,16,"and he joineth the five curtains apart, and the six curtains apart."
2036017,2,36,17,"And he maketh fifty loops on the outer edge of the curtain, in the joining; and fifty loops he hath made on the edge of the curtain which is joining the second;"
2036018,2,36,18,and he maketh fifty hooks of brass to join the tent -- to be one;
2036019,2,36,19,"and he maketh a covering for the tent of rams' skins made red, and a covering of badgers' skins above."
2036020,2,36,20,"And he maketh the boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up;"
2036021,2,36,21,"ten cubits `is' the length of the `one' board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of the `one' board;"
2036022,2,36,22,"two handles `are' to the one board, joined one unto another; so he hath made for all the boards of the tabernacle."
2036023,2,36,23,And he maketh the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward;
2036024,2,36,24,"and forty sockets of silver he hath made under the twenty boards, two sockets under the one board for its two handles, and two sockets under the other board for its two handles."
2036025,2,36,25,"And for the second side of the tabernacle, for the north side, he hath made twenty boards,"
2036026,2,36,26,"and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board;"
2036027,2,36,27,"and for the sides of the tabernacle, westward, hath he made six boards;"
2036028,2,36,28,"and two boards hath he made for the corners of the tabernacle, in the two sides;"
2036029,2,36,29,"and they have been twins below, and together they are twins at its head, at the one ring; so he hath done to both of them at the two corners;"
2036030,2,36,30,"and there have been eight boards; and their sockets of silver `are' sixteen sockets, two sockets under the one board."
2036031,2,36,31,"And he maketh bars of shittim wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,"
2036032,2,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle, for the sides westward;"
2036033,2,36,33,and he maketh the middle bar to enter into the midst of the boards from end to end;
2036034,2,36,34,"and the boards he hath overlaid with gold, and their rings he hath made of gold, places for bars, and he overlayeth the bars with gold."
2036035,2,36,35,"And he maketh the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of a designer he hath made it, `with' cherubs;"
2036036,2,36,36,"and he maketh for it four pillars of shittim `wood', and overlayeth them with gold; their pegs `are' of gold; and he casteth for them four sockets of silver."
2036037,2,36,37,"And he maketh a covering for the opening of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer,"
2036038,2,36,38,"also its five pillars, and their pegs; and he overlaid their tops and their fillets `with' gold, and their five sockets `are' brass."
2037001,2,37,1,"And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;"
2037002,2,37,2,"and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;"
2037003,2,37,3,"and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;"
2037004,2,37,4,"and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,"
2037005,2,37,5,"and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
2037006,2,37,6,"And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;"
2037007,2,37,7,"and he maketh two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he hath made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;"
2037008,2,37,8,"one cherub at the end on this `side', and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends;"
2037009,2,37,9,"and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces `are' one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been."
2037010,2,37,10,"And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,"
2037011,2,37,11,"and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about."
2037012,2,37,12,"And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;"
2037013,2,37,13,"and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which `are' to its four feet;"

2039022,2,39,22,"And he maketh the upper robe of the ephod, work of a weaver, completely of blue;"
2039023,2,39,23,"and the opening of the upper robe `is' in its midst, as the opening of a habergeon, a border `is' to its opening round about, it is not rent;"
2039024,2,39,24,"and they make on the hems of the upper robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined."
2039025,2,39,25,"And they make bells of pure gold, and put the bells in the midst of the pomegranates, on the hems of the upper robe, round about, in the midst of the pomegranates;"

2039031,2,39,31,"and they put on it a ribbon of blue, to put `it' on the mitre above, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2039032,2,39,32,And all the service of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting is completed; and the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done.
2039033,2,39,33,"And they bring in the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all its vessels, its hooks, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;"

2039042,2,39,42,"According to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done all the service;"
2039043,2,39,43,"and Moses seeth all the work, and lo, they have done it as Jehovah hath commanded; so they have done. And Moses doth bless them."
2040001,2,40,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
2040002,2,40,2,"`On the first day of the month, in the first month, thou dost raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,"
2040003,2,40,3,"and hast set there the ark of the testimony, and hast covered over the ark with the vail,"
2040004,2,40,4,"and hast brought in the table, and set its arrangement in order, and hast brought in the candlestick, and caused its lamps to go up."
2040005,2,40,5,"`And thou hast put the golden altar for perfume before the ark of the testimony, and hast put the covering of the opening to the tabernacle,"
2040006,2,40,6,"and hast put the altar of the burnt-offering before the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,"
2040007,2,40,7,"and hast put the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there."
2040008,2,40,8,"`And thou hast set the court round about, and hast placed the covering of the gate of the court,"
2040009,2,40,9,"and hast taken the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle, and all that `is' in it, and hallowed it, and all its vessels, and it hath been holy;"
2040010,2,40,10,"and thou hast anointed the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctified the altar, and the altar hath been most holy;"
2040011,2,40,11,"and thou hast anointed the laver and its base, and sanctified it."
2040012,2,40,12,"`And thou hast brought near Aaron and his sons unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and hast bathed them with water;"
2040013,2,40,13,"and thou hast clothed Aaron with the holy garments, and anointed him, and sanctified him, and he hath acted as priest to Me."
2040014,2,40,14,"`And his sons thou dost bring near, and hast clothed them with coats,"
2040015,2,40,15,"and anointed them as thou hast anointed their father, and they have acted as priests to Me, and their anointing hath been to be to them for a priesthood age-during, to their generations.'"
2040016,2,40,16,And Moses doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done.
2040017,2,40,17,"And it cometh to pass, in the first month, in the second year, in the first of the month, the tabernacle hath been raised up;"
2040018,2,40,18,"and Moses raiseth up the tabernacle, and setteth its sockets, and placeth its boards, and placeth its bars, and raiseth its pillars,"
2040019,2,40,19,"and spreadeth the tent over the tabernacle, and putteth the covering of the tent upon it above, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040020,2,40,20,"And he taketh and putteth the testimony unto the ark, and setteth the staves on the ark, and putteth the mercy-seat on the ark above;"
2040021,2,40,21,"and bringeth in the ark unto the tabernacle, and placeth the vail of the covering, and covereth over the ark of the testimony, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040022,2,40,22,"And he putteth the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, at the outside of the vail,"
2040023,2,40,23,"and setteth in order upon it the arrangement of bread, before Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040024,2,40,24,"And he putteth the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over-against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward,"
2040025,2,40,25,"and causeth the lamps to go up before Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040026,2,40,26,"And he setteth the golden altar in the tent of meeting, before the vail,"
2040027,2,40,27,and maketh perfume on it -- spice-perfume -- as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
2040028,2,40,28,"And he setteth the covering of the opening to the tabernacle,"
2040029,2,40,29,"and the altar of the burnt-offering he hath set at the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and causeth the burnt-offering to go up upon it, and the present, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040030,2,40,30,"And he putteth the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and putteth water there for washing,"
2040031,2,40,31,and Moses and Aaron and his sons have washed their hands and their feet at the same;
2040032,2,40,32,"in their going in unto the tent of meeting, and in their drawing near unto the altar, they wash, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
2040033,2,40,33,"And he raiseth up the court round about the tabernacle, and about the altar, and placeth the covering of the gate of the court; and Moses completeth the work."
2040034,2,40,34,"And the cloud covereth the tent of meeting, and the honour of Jehovah hath filled the tabernacle;"
2040035,2,40,35,"and Moses hath not been able to go in unto the tent of meeting, for the cloud hath tabernacled on it, and the honour of Jehovah hath filled the tabernacle."
2040036,2,40,36,And in the going up of the cloud from off the tabernacle the sons of Israel journey in all their journeys;
2040037,2,40,37,"and if the cloud go not up then they journey not, until the day of its going up:"
2040038,2,40,38,"for the cloud of Jehovah `is' on the tabernacle by day, and fire is in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their journeys."
3001001,3,1,1,"And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,"
3001002,3,1,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to Jehovah, out of the cattle -- out of the herd, or out of the flock -- ye do bring near your offering."
3001003,3,1,3,"`If his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the herd -- a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure, before Jehovah;"
3001004,3,1,4,"and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, and it hath been accepted for him to make atonement for him;"
3001005,3,1,5,"and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near, and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which `is' at the opening of the tent of meeting."
3001006,3,1,6,"`And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it into its pieces;"
3001007,3,1,7,"and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar, and arranged wood on the fire;"
3001008,3,1,8,"and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces, with the head and the fat, on the wood, which `is' on the fire, which `is' on the altar;"
3001009,3,1,9,"and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
3001010,3,1,10,"`And if his offering `is' out of the flock -- out of the sheep or out of the goats -- for a burnt-offering, a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near,"
3001011,3,1,11,"and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;"
3001012,3,1,12,"and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which `is' on the fire, which `is' on the altar;"
3001013,3,1,13,"and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume on the altar; it `is' a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
3001014,3,1,14,"`And if his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,"
3001015,3,1,15,"and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar, and hath wrung off its head, and hath made perfume on the altar, and its blood hath been wrung out by the side of the altar;"
3001016,3,1,16,"and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;"
3001017,3,1,17,"and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate `it'), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on the wood, which `is' on the fire; it `is' a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
3002001,3,2,1,"`And when a person bringeth near an offering, a present to Jehovah, of flour is his offering, and he hath poured on it oil, and hath put on it frankincense;"
3002002,3,2,2,"and he hath brought it in unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he hath taken from thence the fulness of his hand of its flour and of its oil, besides all its frankincense, and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
3002003,3,2,3,"and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah."
3002004,3,2,4,"`And when thou bringest near an offering, a present baked in an oven, `it is of' unleavened cakes of flour mixed with oil, or thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil."
3002005,3,2,5,"`And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the girdel, it is of flour, mixed with oil, unleavened;"
3002006,3,2,6,"divide thou it into parts, and thou hast poured on it oil; it `is' a present."
3002007,3,2,7,"`And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the frying-pan, of flour with oil it is made,"
3002008,3,2,8,"and thou hast brought in the present which is made of these to Jehovah, and `one' hath brought it near unto the priest, and he hath brought it nigh unto the altar,"
3002009,3,2,9,"and the priest hath lifted up from the present its memorial, and hath made perfume on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
3002010,3,2,10,"and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah."
3002011,3,2,11,"No present which ye bring near to Jehovah is made fermented, for with any leaven or any honey ye perfume no fire-offering to Jehovah."
3002012,3,2,12,"`An offering of first-`fruits' -- ye bring them near to Jehovah, but on the altar they go not up, for sweet fragrance."

3002014,3,2,14,"`And if thou bring near a present of first-ripe `fruits' to Jehovah, -- of green ears, roasted with fire, beaten out `corn' of a fruitful field thou dost bring near the present of thy first-ripe `fruits',"
3002015,3,2,15,"and thou hast put on it oil, and laid on it frankincense, it `is' a present;"
3002016,3,2,16,"and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial from its beaten out `corn', and from its oil, besides all its frankincense -- a fire-offering to Jehovah."
3003001,3,3,1,"`And if his offering `is' a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near before Jehovah,"
3003002,3,3,2,"and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the altar round about."

3008017,3,8,17,"and the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he hath burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
3008018,3,8,18,"And he bringeth near the ram of the burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,"
3008019,3,8,19,"and `one' slaughtereth, and Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about;"
3008020,3,8,20,"and the ram he hath cut into its pieces, and Moses maketh perfume with the head, and the pieces, and the fat,"
3008021,3,8,21,"and the inwards and the legs he hath washed with water, and Moses maketh perfume with the whole ram on the altar; it `is' a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance; it `is' a fire-offering to Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
3008022,3,8,22,"And he bringeth near the second ram, a ram of the consecrations, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,"
3008023,3,8,23,"and `one' slaughtereth, and Moses taketh of its blood, and putteth on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;"
3008024,3,8,24,"and he bringeth near the sons of Aaron, and Moses putteth of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot. And Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about,"
3008025,3,8,25,"and taketh the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that `is' on the inwards, and the redundance above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right leg;"
3008026,3,8,26,"and out of the basket of unleavened things, which `is' before Jehovah, he hath taken one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake, and putteth `them' on the fat, and on the right leg;"
3008027,3,8,27,"and putteth the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and waveth them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah."
3008028,3,8,28,"And Moses taketh them from off their hands, and maketh perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering, they `are' consecrations for sweet fragrance; it `is' a fire-offering to Jehovah;"
3008029,3,8,29,"and Moses taketh the breast, and waveth it -- a wave-offering before Jehovah; of the ram of the consecrations it hath been to Moses for a portion, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
3008030,3,8,30,"And Moses taketh of the anointing oil, and of the blood which `is' on the altar, and sprinkleth on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he sanctifieth Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him."
3008031,3,8,31,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, and unto his sons, `Boil ye the flesh at the opening of the tent of meeting, and there ye do eat it and the bread which `is' in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons do eat it."
3008032,3,8,32,`And the remnant of the flesh and of the bread with fire ye burn;
3008033,3,8,33,"and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye go not out seven days, till the day of the fulness, the days of your consecration -- for seven days he doth consecrate your hand;"
3008034,3,8,34,"as he hath done on this day, Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you;"
3008035,3,8,35,"and at the opening of the tent of meeting ye abide, by day and by night seven days, and ye have kept the charge of Jehovah, and die not, for so I have been commanded.'"
3008036,3,8,36,And Aaron doth -- his sons also -- all the things which Jehovah hath commanded by the hand of Moses.
3009001,3,9,1,"And it cometh to pass on the eighth day, Moses hath called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel,"
3009002,3,9,2,"and he saith unto Aaron, `Take to thyself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Jehovah."
3009003,3,9,3,"`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt-offering,"
3009004,3,9,4,"and a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah, and a present mixed with oil; for to-day Jehovah hath appeared unto you.'"
3009005,3,9,5,"And they take that which Moses hath commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting, and all the company draw near and stand before Jehovah;"
3009006,3,9,6,"and Moses saith, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded; do `it', and the honour of Jehovah doth appear unto you.'"
3009007,3,9,7,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Draw near unto the altar, and make thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah hath commanded.'"
3009008,3,9,8,"And Aaron draweth near unto the altar, and slaughtereth the calf of the sin-offering, which `is' for himself;"
3009009,3,9,9,"and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him, and he dippeth his finger in the blood, and putteth `it' on the horns of the altar, and the blood he hath poured out at the foundation of the altar;"
3009010,3,9,10,"and the fat, and the kidneys, and the redundance of the liver, of the sin-offering, he hath made a perfume on the altar, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses;"
3009011,3,9,11,"and the flesh and the skin he hath burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp."
3009012,3,9,12,"And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering, and the sons of Aaron have presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about;"
3009013,3,9,13,"and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him, by its pieces, and the head, and he maketh perfume on the altar;"
3009014,3,9,14,"and he washeth the inwards and the legs, and maketh perfume for the burnt-offering on the altar."
3009015,3,9,15,"And he bringeth near the offering of the people, and taketh the goat of the sin-offering which `is' for the people, and slaughtered it, and maketh it a sin-offering, like the first;"
3009016,3,9,16,"and he bringeth near the burnt-offering, and maketh it, according to the ordinance;"
3009017,3,9,17,"and he bringeth near the present, and filleth his palm with it, and maketh perfume on the altar, apart from the burnt-offering of the morning."
3009018,3,9,18,"And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which `are' for the people, and sons of Aaron present the blood unto him (and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about),"
3009019,3,9,19,"and the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the fat tail, and the covering `of the inwards', and the kidneys, and the redundance above the liver,"
3009020,3,9,20,"and they set the fat on the breasts, and he maketh perfume with the fat on the altar;"
3009021,3,9,21,"and the breasts, and the right leg hath Aaron waved -- a wave-offering before Jehovah, as He hath commanded Moses."
3009022,3,9,22,"And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people, and blesseth them, and cometh down from making the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings."
3009023,3,9,23,"And Moses goeth in -- Aaron also -- unto the tent of meeting, and they come out, and bless the people, and the honour of Jehovah appeareth unto all the people;"
3009024,3,9,24,"and fire cometh out from before Jehovah, and consumeth on the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat; and all the people see, and cry aloud, and fall on their faces."
3010001,3,10,1,"And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, take each his censer, and put in them fire, and put on it perfume, and bring near before Jehovah strange fire, which He hath not commanded them;"
3010002,3,10,2,"and fire goeth out from before Jehovah, and consumeth them, and they die before Jehovah."
3010003,3,10,3,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, `It `is' that which Jehovah hath spoken, saying, By those drawing near to Me I am sanctified, and in the face of all the people I am honoured;' and Aaron is silent."
3010004,3,10,4,"And Moses calleth unto Mishael and unto Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron, and saith unto them, `Come near, bear your brethren from the front of the sanctuary unto the outside of the camp;'"
3010005,3,10,5,"and they come near, and bear them in their coats unto the outside of the camp, as Moses hath spoken."
3010006,3,10,6,"And Moses saith unto Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar his sons, `Your heads ye do not uncover, and your garments ye do not rend, that ye die not, and on all the company He be wroth; as to your brethren, the whole house of Israel, they bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled;"
3010007,3,10,7,"and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go out, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah `is' upon you;' and they do according to the word of Moses."
3010008,3,10,8,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron, saying,"
3010009,3,10,9,"`Wine and strong drink thou dost not drink, thou, and thy sons with thee, in your going in unto the tent of meeting, and ye die not -- a statute age-during to your generations;"
3010010,3,10,10,"so as to make a separation between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the pure;"
3010011,3,10,11,and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.'
3010012,3,10,12,"And Moses speaketh unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar his sons, who are left, `Take ye the present that is left from the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened near the altar, for it `is' most holy,"
3010013,3,10,13,"and ye have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is' thy portion, and the portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah; for so I have been commanded."
3010014,3,10,14,"`And the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, ye do eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for thy portion and the portion of thy sons they have been given, out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the sons of Israel;"
3010015,3,10,15,"the leg of the heave-offering, and breast of the wave-offering, besides fire-offerings of the fat, they do bring in to wave a wave-offering before Jehovah, and it hath been to thee, and to thy sons with thee, by a statute age-during, as Jehovah hath commanded.'"
3010016,3,10,16,"And the goat of the sin-offering hath Moses diligently sought, and lo, it is burnt, and he is wroth against Eleazar, and against Ithamar, sons of Aaron, who are left, saying,"
3010017,3,10,17,"`Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, for it `is' most holy -- and it He hath given to you to take away the iniquity of the company, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?"
3010018,3,10,18,"lo, its blood hath not been brought in unto the holy place within; eating ye do eat it in the holy place, as I have commanded.'"
3010019,3,10,19,"And Aaron speaketh unto Moses, `Lo, to-day they have brought near their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and `things' like these meet me, yet I have eaten a sin-offering to-day; is it good in the eyes of Jehovah?'"
3010020,3,10,20,"And Moses hearkeneth, and it is good in his eyes."
3011001,3,11,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them,"
3011002,3,11,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, This `is' the beast which ye do eat out of all the beasts which `are' on the earth:"

3013030,3,13,30,"then hath the priest seen the plague, and lo, its appearance is deeper than the skin, and in it a thin shining hair, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; it `is' a scall -- it `is' a leprosy of the head or of the beard."
3013031,3,13,31,"`And when the priest seeth the plague of the scall, and lo, its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then hath the priest shut up `him who hath' the plague of the scall seven days."
3013032,3,13,32,"`And the priest hath seen the plague on the seventh day, and lo, the scall hath not spread, and a shining hair hath not been in it, and the appearance of the scall is not deeper than the skin,"
3013033,3,13,33,"then he hath shaved himself, but the scall he doth not shave; and the priest hath shut up `him who hath' the scall a second seven days."
3013034,3,13,34,"And the priest hath seen the scall on the seventh day, and lo, the scall hath not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and the priest hath pronounced him clean, and he hath washed his garments, and hath been clean."
3013035,3,13,35,"`And if the scall spread greatly in the skin after his cleansing,"
3013036,3,13,36,"and the priest hath seen him, and lo, the scall hath spread in the skin, the priest seeketh not for the shining hair, he is unclean;"
3013037,3,13,37,"and if in his eyes the scall hath stayed, and black hair hath sprung up in it, the scall hath been healed -- he `is' clean -- and the priest hath pronounced him clean."
3013038,3,13,38,"`And when a man or woman hath in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots,"
3013039,3,13,39,"and the priest hath seen, and lo, in the skin of their flesh white weak bright spots, it `is' a freckled spot broken out in the skin; he `is' clean."
3013040,3,13,40,"`And when a man's head `is' polished, he `is' bald, he `is' clean;"
3013041,3,13,41,"and if from the corner of his face his head is polished, he `is' bald of the forehead; he `is' clean."
3013042,3,13,42,"`And when there is in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, a very red white plague, it `is' a leprosy breaking out in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead;"
3013043,3,13,43,"and the priest hath seen him, and lo, the rising of the very red white plague in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, `is' as the appearance of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh,"
3013044,3,13,44,"he `is' a leprous man, he `is' unclean; the priest doth pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague `is' in his head."

3013049,3,13,49,"and the plague hath been very green or very red in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it `is' a plague of leprosy, and it hath been shewn the priest."
3013050,3,13,50,"`And the priest hath seen the plague, and hath shut up `that which hath' the plague, seven days;"
3013051,3,13,51,"and he hath seen the plague on the seventh day, and the plague hath spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, of all that is made of skin for work; the plague `is' a fretting leprosy, it `is' unclean."
3013052,3,13,52,"`And he hath burnt the garment, or the warp, or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any vessel of skin in which the plague is; for it `is' a fretting leprosy; with fire it is burnt."
3013053,3,13,53,"`And if the priest see, and lo, the plague hath not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin,"
3013054,3,13,54,"then hath the priest commanded, and they have washed that in which the plague `is', and he hath shut it up a second seven days."
3013055,3,13,55,"And the priest hath seen `that which hath' the plague after it hath been washed, and lo, the plague hath not changed its aspect, and the plague hath not spread, -- it `is' unclean; with fire thou dost burn it; it `is' a fretting in its back-part or in its front-part."
3013056,3,13,56,"`And if the priest hath seen, and lo, the plague `is' become weak after it hath been washed, then he hath rent it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;"
3013057,3,13,57,"and if it still be seen in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it `is' a fretting; with fire thou dost burn it -- that in which the plague `is'."
3013058,3,13,58,"`And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any vessel of skin which thou dost wash when the plague hath turned aside from them, then it hath been washed a second time, and hath been clean."
3013059,3,13,59,"`This `is' the law of a plague of leprosy `in' a garment of wool or of linen, or of the warp or of the woof, or of any vessel of skin, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.'"
3014001,3,14,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3014002,3,14,2,"`This is a law of the leper, in the day of his cleansing, that he hath been brought in unto the priest,"
3014003,3,14,3,"and the priest hath gone out unto the outside of the camp, and the priest hath seen, and lo, the plague of leprosy hath ceased from the leper,"
3014004,3,14,4,"and the priest hath commanded, and he hath taken for him who is to be cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop."
3014005,3,14,5,"`And the priest hath commanded, and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;"
3014006,3,14,6,"`as to' the living bird, he taketh it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and hath dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, over the running water,"
3014007,3,14,7,"and he hath sprinkled on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and hath pronounced him clean, and hath sent out the living bird on the face of the field."
3014008,3,14,8,"`And he who is to be cleansed hath washed his garments, and hath shaved all his hair, and hath bathed with water, and hath been clean, and afterwards he doth come in unto the camp, and hath dwelt at the outside of his tent seven days."
3014009,3,14,9,"`And it hath been, on the seventh day -- he shaveth all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair he doth shave, and he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and hath been clean."
3014010,3,14,10,"`And on the eighth day he taketh two lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe-lamb, daughter of a year, a perfect one, and three tenth deals of flour `for' a present, mixed with oil, and one log of oil."
3014011,3,14,11,"`And the priest who is cleansing hath caused the man who is to be cleansed to stand with them before Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting,"
3014012,3,14,12,"and the priest hath taken the one he-lamb, and hath brought it near for a guilt-offering, also the log of oil, and hath waved them -- a wave offering before Jehovah."
3014013,3,14,13,"`And he hath slaughtered the lamb in the place where he slaughtereth the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy place; for like the sin-offering the guilt-offering is to the priest; it `is' most holy."
3014014,3,14,14,"`And the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;"
3014015,3,14,15,"and the priest hath taken of the log of oil, and hath poured on the left palm of the priest,"
3014016,3,14,16,"and the priest hath dipped his right finger in the oil which `is' on his left palm, and hath sprinkled of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah."
3014017,3,14,17,"`And of the residue of the oil which `is' on his palm, the priest putteth on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt-offering;"
3014018,3,14,18,"and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest, he putteth on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah."
3014019,3,14,19,"`And the priest hath made the sin-offering, and hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterwards he doth slaughter the burnt-offering;"
3014020,3,14,20,"and the priest hath caused the burnt-offering to ascend, also the present, on the altar, and the priest hath made atonement for him, and he hath been clean."
3014021,3,14,21,"`And if he `is' poor, and his hand is not reaching `these things', then he hath taken one lamb -- a guilt-offering, for a wave-offering, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth deal of flour mixed with oil for a present, and a log of oil,"
3014022,3,14,22,"and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, which his hand reacheth to, and one hath been a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering;"
3014023,3,14,23,"and he hath brought them in on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah."
3014024,3,14,24,"`And the priest hath taken the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest hath waved them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah;"
3014025,3,14,25,"and he hath slaughtered the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;"
3014026,3,14,26,and the priest doth pour of the oil on the left palm of the priest;
3014027,3,14,27,"and the priest hath sprinkled with his right finger of the oil which `is' on his left palm, seven times before Jehovah."
3014028,3,14,28,"`And the priest hath put of the oil which `is' on his palm, on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt-offering;"
3014029,3,14,29,"and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest he doth put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him, before Jehovah."
3014030,3,14,30,"`And he hath made the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons (from that which his hand reacheth to,"
3014031,3,14,31,"`even' that which his hand reacheth to), the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt offering, besides the present, and the priest hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Jehovah."
3014032,3,14,32,"This `is' a law of him in whom `is' a plague of leprosy, whose hand reacheth not to his cleansing.'"
3014033,3,14,33,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,"
3014034,3,14,34,"`When ye come in unto the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you for a possession, and I have put a plague of leprosy in a house `in' the land of your possession;"
3014035,3,14,35,"then hath he whose the house `is' come in and declared to the priest, saying, As a plague hath appeared to me in the house;"
3014036,3,14,36,"and the priest hath commanded, and they have prepared the house before the priest cometh in to see the plague (that all which `is' in the house be not unclean), and afterwards doth the priest come in to see the house;"
3014037,3,14,37,"and he hath seen the plague, and lo, the plague `is' in the walls of the house, hollow strakes, very green or very red, and their appearance `is' lower than the wall,"
3014038,3,14,38,"and the priest hath gone out of the house unto the opening of the house, and hath shut up the house seven days."
3014039,3,14,39,"`And the priest hath turned back on the seventh day, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the walls of the house,"
3014040,3,14,40,"and the priest hath commanded, and they have drawn out the stones in which the plague `is', and have cast them unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place;"
3014041,3,14,41,"and the house he doth cause to be scraped within round about, and they have poured out the clay which they have scraped off, at the outside of the city, at an unclean place;"
3014042,3,14,42,"and they have taken other stones, and brought `them' in unto the place of the stones, and other clay he taketh and hath daubed the house."
3014043,3,14,43,"`And if the plague return, and hath broken out in the house, after he hath drawn out the stones, and after the scraping of the house, and after the daubing;"
3014044,3,14,44,"then hath the priest come in and seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the house; it `is' a fretting leprosy in the house; it `is' unclean."
3014045,3,14,45,"`And he hath broken down the house, its stones, and its wood, and all the clay of the house, and he hath brought `them' forth unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place."
3014046,3,14,46,"`And he who is going in unto the house all the days he hath shut it up, is unclean till the evening;"
3014047,3,14,47,and he who is lying in the house doth wash his garments; and he who is eating in the house doth wash his garments.
3014048,3,14,48,"`And if the priest certainly come in, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath not spread in the house after the daubing of the house, then hath the priest pronounced the house clean, for the plague hath been healed."
3014049,3,14,49,"`And he hath taken for the cleansing of the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;"
3014050,3,14,50,"and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;"
3014051,3,14,51,"and he hath taken the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and hath dipped them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the running water, and hath sprinkled upon the house seven times."
3014052,3,14,52,"`And he hath cleansed the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;"

3022006,3,22,6,"the person who cometh against it -- hath even been unclean till the evening, and doth not eat of the holy things, but hath bathed his flesh with water,"
3022007,3,22,7,"and the sun hath gone in, and he hath been clean, and afterwards he doth eat of the holy things, for it `is' his food;"
3022008,3,22,8,"a carcase or torn thing he doth not eat, for uncleanness thereby; I `am' Jehovah."
3022009,3,22,9,"`And they have kept My charge, and bear no sin for it, that they have died for it when they pollute it; I `am' Jehovah sanctifying them."
3022010,3,22,10,`And no stranger doth eat of the holy thing; a settler of a priest and an hireling doth not eat of the holy thing;
3022011,3,22,11,"and when a priest buyeth a person, the purchase of his money, he doth eat of it, also one born in his house; they do eat of his bread."
3022012,3,22,12,"`And a priest's daughter, when she is a strange man's, -- she, of the heave-offering of the holy things doth not eat;"
3022013,3,22,13,"and a priest's daughter, when she is a widow, or cast out, and hath no seed, and hath turned back unto the house of her father, as `in' her youth, of her father's bread she doth eat; but no stranger doth eat of it."
3022014,3,22,14,"`And when a man doth eat of a holy thing through ignorance, then he hath added its fifth part to it, and hath given `it' to the priest, with the holy thing;"
3022015,3,22,15,"and they do not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel -- that which they lift up to Jehovah,"
3022016,3,22,16,"nor have caused them to bear the iniquity of the guilt-offering in their eating their holy things; for I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying them.'"
3022017,3,22,17,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3022018,3,22,18,"`Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who bringeth near his offering, of all his vows, or of all his willing offerings which they bring near to Jehovah for a burnt-offering;"
3022019,3,22,19,"at your pleasure a perfect one, a male of the herd, of the sheep or of the goats;"
3022020,3,22,20,"nothing in which `is' blemish do ye bring near, for it is not for a pleasing thing for you."
3022021,3,22,21,"`And when a man bringeth near a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, to complete a vow, or for a willing-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it is perfect for a pleasing thing: no blemish is in it;"
3022022,3,22,22,"blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed -- ye do not bring these near to Jehovah, and a fire-offering ye do not make of them on the altar to Jehovah."
3022023,3,22,23,"`As to an ox or a sheep enlarged or dwarfed -- a willing-offering ye do make it, but for a vow it is not pleasing."
3022024,3,22,24,"As to a bruised, or beaten, or enlarged, or cut thing -- ye do not bring `it' near to Jehovah; even in your land ye do not do it."
3022025,3,22,25,"And from the hand of a son of a stranger ye do not bring near the bread of your God, of any of these, for their corruption `is' in them; blemish `is' in them; they are not pleasing for you.'"
3022026,3,22,26,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3022027,3,22,27,"`When ox or lamb or goat is born, and it hath been seven days under its dam, then from the eighth day and henceforth, it is pleasing for an offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah;"
3022028,3,22,28,"but an ox or sheep -- it and its young one, ye do not slaughter in one day."
3022029,3,22,29,"`And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice,"
3022030,3,22,30,"on that day it is eaten, ye do not leave of it till morning; I `am' Jehovah;"
3022031,3,22,31,"and ye have kept my commands, and have done them; I `am' Jehovah;"
3022032,3,22,32,"and ye do not pollute My holy name, and I have been hallowed in the midst of the sons of Israel; I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying you,"
3022033,3,22,33,"who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt, to become your God; I `am' Jehovah.'"
3023001,3,23,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3023002,3,23,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim, holy convocations, `are' these: they `are' My appointed seasons:"
3023003,3,23,3,"six days is work done, and in the seventh day `is' a sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye do no work; it `is' a sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings."
3023004,3,23,4,"`These `are' appointed seasons of Jehovah, holy convocations, which ye proclaim in their appointed seasons:"
3023005,3,23,5,"in the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, `is' the passover to Jehovah;"
3023006,3,23,6,and on the fifteenth day of this month `is' the feast of unleavened things to Jehovah; seven days unleavened things ye do eat;
3023007,3,23,7,"on the first day ye have a holy convocation, ye do no servile work;"
3023008,3,23,8,and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah seven days; in the seventh day `is' a holy convocation; ye do no servile work.'
3023009,3,23,9,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3023010,3,23,10,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought in the sheaf, the beginning of your harvest unto the priest,"
3023011,3,23,11,then he hath waved the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the morrow of the sabbath doth the priest wave it.
3023012,3,23,12,"`And ye have prepared in the day of your waving the sheaf a lamb, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering to Jehovah,"
3023013,3,23,13,"and its present two tenth deals of flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance, and its drink-offering, wine, a fourth of the hin."
3023014,3,23,14,"`And bread and roasted corn and full ears ye do not eat until this self-same day, until your bringing in the offering of your God -- a statute age-during to your generations, in all your dwellings."
3023015,3,23,15,"`And ye have numbered to you from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day of your bringing in the sheaf of the wave-offering: they are seven perfect sabbaths;"
3023016,3,23,16,"unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath ye do number fifty days, and ye have brought near a new present to Jehovah;"
3023017,3,23,17,"out of your dwellings ye bring in bread of a wave-offering, two `loaves', of two tenth deals of flour they are, `with' yeast they are baken, first-`fruits' to Jehovah."
3023018,3,23,18,"`And ye have brought near, besides the bread, seven lambs, perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams; they are a burnt-offering to Jehovah, with their present and their libations, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
3023019,3,23,19,"`And ye have prepared one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs, sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace-offerings,"
3023020,3,23,20,"and the priest hath waved them, besides the bread of the first-`fruits' -- a wave-offering before Jehovah, besides the two lambs; they are holy to Jehovah for the priest;"
3023021,3,23,21,"and ye have proclaimed on this self-same day: a holy convocation is to you, ye do no servile work -- a statute age-during in all your dwellings, to your generations."
3023022,3,23,22,"`And in your reaping the harvest of your land thou dost not complete the corner of thy field in thy reaping, and the gleaning of thy harvest thou dost not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner thou dost leave them; I Jehovah `am' your God.'"
3023023,3,23,23,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3023024,3,23,24,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, ye have a sabbath, a memorial of shouting, a holy convocation;"
3023025,3,23,25,"ye do no servile work, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah.'"
3023026,3,23,26,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3023027,3,23,27,"`Only -- on the tenth of this seventh month is a day of atonements; ye have a holy convocation, and ye have humbled yourselves, and have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah;"
3023028,3,23,28,"and ye do no work in this self-same day, for it is a day of atonements, to make atonement for you, before Jehovah your God."
3023029,3,23,29,`For any person who is not humbled in this self-same day hath even been cut off from his people;
3023030,3,23,30,and any person who doth any work in this self-same day I have even destroyed that person from the midst of his people;
3023031,3,23,31,ye do no work -- a statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings.
3023032,3,23,32,"It `is' a sabbath of rest to you, and ye have humbled yourselves in the ninth of the month at even; from evening till evening ye do keep your sabbath.'"
3023033,3,23,33,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3023034,3,23,34,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month `is' a feast of booths seven days to Jehovah;"
3023035,3,23,35,"on the first day `is' a holy convocation, ye do no servile work,"
3023036,3,23,36,"seven days ye bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, on the eighth day ye have a holy convocation, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah; it `is' a restraint, ye do no servile work."
3023037,3,23,37,"`These `are' appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim holy convocations, to bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a present, a sacrifice, and libations, a thing of a day in its day,"
3023038,3,23,38,"apart from the sabbaths of Jehovah, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your willing-offerings, which ye give to Jehovah."
3023039,3,23,39,"`Only -- in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in your gathering the increase of the land, ye do keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day `is' a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath;"
3023040,3,23,40,"and ye have taken to yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of a brook, and have rejoiced before Jehovah your God seven days."
3023041,3,23,41,"`And ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah, seven days in a year -- a statute age-during to your generations; in the seventh month ye keep it a feast."
3023042,3,23,42,"`In booths ye dwell seven days; all who are natives in Israel dwell in booths,"
3023043,3,23,43,"so that your generations do know that in booths I caused the sons of Israel to dwell; in my bringing them out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, `am' your God.'"
3023044,3,23,44,And Moses speaketh `concerning' the appointed seasons of Jehovah unto the sons of Israel.
3024001,3,24,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3024002,3,24,2,"`Command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten, for the lamp, to cause a light to go up continually;"
3024003,3,24,3,at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting doth Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah continually -- a statute age-during to your generations;
3024004,3,24,4,by the pure candlestick he doth arrange the lights before Jehovah continually.
3024005,3,24,5,"`And thou hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake,"
3024006,3,24,6,"and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah,"
3024007,3,24,7,"and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it hath been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Jehovah."
3024008,3,24,8,"`On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel -- a covenant age-during;"
3024009,3,24,9,"and it hath been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is' most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah -- a statute age-during.'"
3024010,3,24,10,"And a son of an Israelitish woman goeth out (and he `is' son of an Egyptian man), in the midst of the sons of Israel, and strive in the camp do the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel,"
3024011,3,24,11,"and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name, and revileth; and they bring him in unto Moses; and his mother's name `is' Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;"
3024012,3,24,12,and he causeth him to rest in charge -- to explain to them by the mouth of Jehovah.
3024013,3,24,13,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3024014,3,24,14,"`Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head, and all the company have stoned him."
3024015,3,24,15,"`And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, When any man revileth his God -- then he hath borne his sin;"
3024016,3,24,16,"and he who is execrating the name of Jehovah is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native, in his execrating the Name, is put to death."
3024017,3,24,17,"`And when a man smiteth any soul of man, he is certainly put to death."
3024018,3,24,18,"`And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, body for body."
3024019,3,24,19,"`And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow, as he hath done so it is done to him;"
3024020,3,24,20,"breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he putteth a blemish in a man so it is done in him."
3024021,3,24,21,"`And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, and he who smiteth `the life of' man is put to death;"
3024022,3,24,22,one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I `am' Jehovah your God.'
3024023,3,24,23,"And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and they bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the sons of Israel have done as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
3025001,3,25,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in mount Sinai, saying,"
3025002,3,25,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, then hath the land kept a sabbath to Jehovah."
3025003,3,25,3,"`Six years thou dost sow thy field, and six years thou dost prune thy vineyard, and hast gathered its increase,"
3025004,3,25,4,"and in the seventh year a sabbath of rest is to the land, a sabbath to Jehovah; thy field thou dost not sow, and thy vineyard thou dost not prune;"
3025005,3,25,5,"the spontaneous growth of thy harvest thou dost not reap, and the grapes of thy separated thing thou dost not gather, a year of rest it is to the land."
3025006,3,25,6,"`And the sabbath of the land hath been to you for food, to thee, and to thy man-servant, and to thy handmaid, and to thy hireling, and to thy settler, who are sojourning with thee;"
3025007,3,25,7,"and to thy cattle, and to the beast which `is' in thy land, is all thine increase for food."
3025008,3,25,8,"`And thou hast numbered to thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and the days of the seven sabbaths of years have been to thee nine and forty years,"
3025009,3,25,9,"and thou hast caused a trumpet of shouting to pass over in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month; in the day of the atonements ye do cause a trumpet to pass over through all your land;"
3025010,3,25,10,"and ye have hallowed the year, the fiftieth year; and ye have proclaimed liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; a jubilee it is to you; and ye have turned back each unto his possession; yea, each unto his family ye do turn back."
3025011,3,25,11,"`A jubilee it `is', the fiftieth year, a year it is to you; ye sow not, nor reap its spontaneous growth, nor gather its separated things;"
3025012,3,25,12,"for a jubilee it `is', holy it is to you; out of the field ye eat its increase;"
3025013,3,25,13,in the year of this jubilee ye turn back each unto his possession.
3025014,3,25,14,"`And when thou sellest anything to thy fellow, or buyest from the hand of thy fellow, ye do not oppress one another;"
3025015,3,25,15,by the number of years after the jubilee thou dost buy from thy fellow; by the number of the years of increase he doth sell to thee;
3025016,3,25,16,"according to the multitude of the years thou dost multiply its price, and according to the fewness of the years thou dost diminish its price; for a number of increases he is selling to thee;"
3025017,3,25,17,"and ye do not oppress one another, and thou hast been afraid of thy God; for I `am' Jehovah your God."
3025018,3,25,18,"`And ye have done My statutes, and My judgments ye keep, and have done them, and ye have dwelt on the land confidently,"
3025019,3,25,19,"and the land hath given its fruit, and ye have eaten to satiety, and have dwelt confidently on it."
3025020,3,25,20,"`And when ye say, What do we eat in the seventh year, lo, we do not sow, nor gather our increase?"
3025021,3,25,21,"then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it hath made the increase for three years;"
3025022,3,25,22,"and ye have sown the eighth year, and have eaten of the old increase; until the ninth year, until the coming in of its increase, ye do eat the old."
3025023,3,25,23,"`And the land is not sold -- to extinction, for the land `is' Mine, for sojourners and settlers `are' ye with Me;"
3025024,3,25,24,and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land.
3025025,3,25,25,"`When thy brother becometh poor, and hath sold his possession, then hath his redeemer who is near unto him come, and he hath redeemed the sold thing of his brother;"
3025026,3,25,26,"and when a man hath no redeemer, and his own hand hath attained, and he hath found as sufficient `for' its redemption,"
3025027,3,25,27,"then he hath reckoned the years of its sale, and hath given back that which is over to the man to whom he sold `it', and he hath returned to his possession."
3025028,3,25,28,"`And if his hand hath not found sufficiency to give back to him, then hath his sold thing been in the hand of him who buyeth it till the year of jubilee; and it hath gone out in the jubilee, and he hath returned to his possession."
3025029,3,25,29,"`And when a man selleth a dwelling-house `in' a walled city, then hath his right of redemption been until the completion of a year from its selling; days -- is his right of redemption;"
3025030,3,25,30,"and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year, then hath the house which `is' in a walled city been established to extinction to the buyer of it, to his generations; it goeth not out in the jubilee;"
3025031,3,25,31,"and a house of the villages which have no wall round about, on the field of the country is reckoned; redemption is to it, and in the jubilee it goeth out."
3025032,3,25,32,`As to cities of the Levites -- houses of the cities of their possession -- redemption age-during is to the Levites;
3025033,3,25,33,"as to him who redeemeth from the Levites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession have gone out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel."
3025034,3,25,34,"And a field, a suburb of their cities, is not sold; for a possession age-during it `is' to them."
3025035,3,25,35,"`And when thy brother is become poor, and his hand hath failed with thee, then thou hast kept hold on him, sojourner and settler, and he hath lived with thee;"
3025036,3,25,36,"thou takest no usury from him, or increase; and thou hast been afraid of thy God; and thy brother hath lived with thee;"
3025037,3,25,37,"thy money thou givest not to him in usury, and for increase thou givest not thy food;"

3025039,3,25,39,"`And when thy brother becometh poor with thee, and he hath been sold to thee, thou dost not lay on him servile service;"
3025040,3,25,40,"as an hireling, as a settler, he is with thee, till the year of the jubilee he doth serve with thee, --"
3025041,3,25,41,"then he hath gone out from thee, he and his sons with him, and hath turned back unto his family; even unto the possession of his fathers he doth turn back."
3025042,3,25,42,"`For they `are' My servants, whom I have brought out from the land of Egypt: they are not sold `with' the sale of a servant;"
3025043,3,25,43,"thou rulest not over him with rigour, and thou hast been afraid of thy God."
3025044,3,25,44,"`And thy man-servant and thy handmaid whom thou hast `are' of the nations who `are' round about you; of them ye buy man-servant and handmaid,"
3025045,3,25,45,"and also of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you, of them ye buy, and of their families who `are' with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they have been to you for a possession;"
3025046,3,25,46,"and ye have taken them for inheritance to your sons after you, to occupy `for' a possession; to the age ye lay service upon them, but upon your brethren, the sons of Israel, one with another, thou dost not rule over him with rigour."
3025047,3,25,47,"`And when the hand of a sojourner or settler with thee attaineth `riches', and thy brother with him hath become poor, and he hath been sold to a sojourner, a settler with thee, or to the root of the family of a sojourner,"
3025048,3,25,48,"after he hath been sold, there is a right of redemption to him; one of his brethren doth redeem him,"
3025049,3,25,49,"or his uncle, or a son of his uncle, doth redeem him, or any of the relations of his flesh, of his family, doth redeem him, or -- his own hand hath attained -- then he hath been redeemed."
3025050,3,25,50,"`And he hath reckoned with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him till the year of jubilee, and the money of his sale hath been by the number of years; as the days of an hireling it is with him."
3025051,3,25,51,"`If yet many years, according to them he giveth back his redemption `money', from the money of his purchase."
3025052,3,25,52,"`And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee, then he hath reckoned with him, according to his years he doth give back his redemption `money';"

3025054,3,25,54,"`And if he is not redeemed in these `years', then he hath gone out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him."
3025055,3,25,55,"For to Me `are' the sons of Israel servants; My servants they `are', whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, `am' your God."

3026009,3,26,9,"`And I have turned unto you, and have made you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and have established My covenant with you;"

3026016,3,26,16,"I also do this to you, and I have appointed over you trouble, the consumption, and the burning fever, consuming eyes, and causing pain of soul; and your seed in vain ye have sowed, and your enemies have eaten it;"
3026017,3,26,17,"and I have set My face against you, and ye have been smitten before your enemies; and those hating you have ruled over you, and ye have fled, and there is none pursuing you."
3026018,3,26,18,"`And if unto these ye hearken not to Me, -- then I have added to chastise you seven times for your sins;"
3026019,3,26,19,"and I have broken the pride of your strength, and have made your heavens as iron, and your earth as brass;"
3026020,3,26,20,"and consumed hath been your strength in vain, and your land doth not give her produce, and the tree of the land doth not give its fruit."
3026021,3,26,21,"`And if ye walk with Me `in' opposition, and are not willing to hearken to Me, then I have added to you a plague seven times, according to your sins,"
3026022,3,26,22,"and sent against you the beast of the field, and it hath bereaved you; and I have cut off your cattle, and have made you few, and your ways have been desolate."
3026023,3,26,23,"`And if by these ye are not instructed by Me, and have walked with Me `in' opposition,"
3026024,3,26,24,"then I have walked -- I also -- with you in opposition, and have smitten you, even I, seven times for your sins;"
3026025,3,26,25,"and I have brought in on you a sword, executing the vengeance of a covenant; and ye have been gathered unto your cities, and I have sent pestilence into your midst, and ye have been given into the hand of an enemy."
3026026,3,26,26,"`In My breaking to you the staff of bread, then ten women have baked your bread in one oven, and have given back your bread by weight; and ye have eaten, and are not satisfied."
3026027,3,26,27,"`And if for this ye hearken not to Me, and have walked with Me in opposition,"
3026028,3,26,28,"then I have walked with you in the fury of opposition, and have chastised you, even I, seven times for your sins."
3026029,3,26,29,`And ye have eaten the flesh of your sons; even flesh of your daughters ye do eat.

3026031,3,26,31,"and I have made your cities a waste, and have made desolate your sanctuaries, and I smell not at your sweet fragrances;"
3026032,3,26,32,"and I have made desolate the land, and your enemies, who are dwelling in it, have been astonished at it."
3026033,3,26,33,"And you I scatter among nations, and have drawn out after you a sword, and your land hath been a desolation, and your cities are a waste."
3026034,3,26,34,"`Then doth the land enjoy its sabbaths -- all the days of the desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies -- then doth the land rest, and hath enjoyed its sabbaths;"
3026035,3,26,35,all the days of the desolation it resteth that which it hath not rested in your sabbaths in your dwelling on it.
3026036,3,26,36,"`And those who are left of you -- I have also brought a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a leaf driven away hath pursued them, and they have fled -- flight from a sword -- and they have fallen, and there is none pursuing."
3026037,3,26,37,"And they have stumbled one on another, as from the face of a sword, and there is none pursuing, and ye have no standing before your enemies,"
3026038,3,26,38,"and ye have perished among the nations, and the land of your enemies hath consumed you."
3026039,3,26,39,"`And those who are left of you -- they consume away in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, with them they consume away."
3026040,3,26,40,"`And -- they have confessed their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they have trespassed against Me, and also, that they have walked with Me, in opposition,"
3026041,3,26,41,"also I walk to them in opposition, and have brought them into the land of their enemies -- or then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity, --"
3026042,3,26,42,"then I have remembered My covenant `with' Jacob, and also My covenant `with' Isaac, and also My covenant `with' Abraham I remember, and the land I remember."
3026043,3,26,43,"`And -- the land is left of them, and doth enjoy its sabbaths, in the desolation without them, and they accept the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because, against My judgments they have kicked, and My statutes hath their soul loathed,"
3026044,3,26,44,"and also even this, in their being in the land of their enemies, I have not rejected them, nor have I loathed them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I `am' Jehovah their God; --"
3026045,3,26,45,"then I have remembered for them the covenant of the ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to become their God; I `am' Jehovah.'"
3026046,3,26,46,"These `are' the statutes, and the judgments, and the laws, which Jehovah hath given between Him and the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses."
3027001,3,27,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
3027002,3,27,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When a man maketh a wonderful vow, by thy valuation the persons `are' Jehovah's."
3027003,3,27,3,"When thy valuation hath been of the male from a son of twenty years even unto a son of sixty years, then hath been thy valuation fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary."
3027004,3,27,4,And if it `is' a female -- then hath thy valuation been thirty shekels;
3027005,3,27,5,"and if from a son of five years even unto a son of twenty years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels;"
3027006,3,27,6,"and if from a son of a month even unto a son of five years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation `is' three shekels of silver;"
3027007,3,27,7,"and if from a son of sixty years and above -- if a male, then hath thy valuation been fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels."
3027008,3,27,8,"`And if he is poorer than thy valuation, then he hath presented himself before the priest, and the priest hath valued him; according to that which the hand of him who is vowing doth reach doth the priest value him."
3027009,3,27,9,"`And if `it is' a beast of which they bring near an offering to Jehovah, all that `one' giveth of it to Jehovah is holy;"
3027010,3,27,10,"he doth not change it nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he really change beast for beast, -- then it hath been -- it and its exchange is holy."
3027011,3,27,11,"`And if `it is' any unclean beast of which they do not bring near an offering to Jehovah, then he hath presented the beast before the priest,"
3027012,3,27,12,"and the priest hath valued it; whether good or bad, according to thy valuation, O priest, so it is;"
3027013,3,27,13,"and if he really redeem it, then he hath added its fifth to thy valuation."
3027014,3,27,14,"`And when a man sanctifieth his house, a holy thing to Jehovah, then hath the priest valued it, whether good or bad; as the priest doth value it so it standeth;"
3027015,3,27,15,"and if he who is sanctifying doth redeem his house, then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath become his."
3027016,3,27,16,"`And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to Jehovah, then hath thy valuation been according to its seed; a homer of barley-seed at fifty shekels of silver;"
3027017,3,27,17,"if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to thy valuation it standeth;"
3027018,3,27,18,"and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then hath the priest reckoned to him the money according to the years which are left, unto the year of the jubilee, and it hath been abated from thy valuation."
3027019,3,27,19,"`And if he really redeem the field -- he who is sanctifying it -- then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath been established to him;"
3027020,3,27,20,"and if he do not redeem the field, or if he hath sold the field to another man, it is not redeemed any more;"
3027021,3,27,21,"and the field hath been, in its going out in the jubilee, holy to Jehovah as a field which is devoted; to the priest is its possession."
3027022,3,27,22,`And if the field of his purchase (which `is' not of the fields of his possession) `one' sanctify to Jehovah --
3027023,3,27,23,"then hath the priest reckoned to him the amount of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee, and he hath given thy valuation in that day -- a holy thing to Jehovah;"
3027024,3,27,24,"in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from whom he bought it, to him whose `is' the possession of the land."
3027025,3,27,25,And all thy valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs is the shekel.
3027026,3,27,26,"`Only, a firstling which is Jehovah's firstling among beasts -- no man doth sanctify it, whether ox or sheep; it `is' Jehovah's."
3027027,3,27,27,"And if among the unclean beasts, then he hath ransomed `it' at thy valuation, and he hath added its fifth to it; and if it is not redeemed, then it hath been sold at thy valuation."
3027028,3,27,28,"`Only, no devoted thing which a man devoteth to Jehovah, of all that he hath, of man, and beast, and of the field of his possession, is sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah."
3027029,3,27,29,"`No devoted thing, which is devoted of man, is ransomed, it is surely put to death."
3027030,3,27,30,"And all tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's -- holy to Jehovah."
3027031,3,27,31,"`And if a man really redeem `any' of his tithe, its fifth he addeth to it."
3027032,3,27,32,`And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock -- all that passeth by under the rod -- the tenth is holy to Jehovah;
3027033,3,27,33,"he enquireth not between good and bad, nor doth he change it; and if he really change it -- then it hath been -- it and its exchange is holy; it is not redeemed.'"
3027034,3,27,34,"These `are' the commands which Jehovah hath commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai."
4001001,4,1,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, saying:"
4001002,4,1,2,"`Take ye up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel by their families, by the house of their fathers, in the number of names -- every male by their polls;"
4001003,4,1,3,"from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel, ye do number them by their hosts, thou and Aaron;"

4005007,4,5,7,"and they have confessed their sin which they have done, then he hath restored his guilt in its principal, and its fifth is adding to it, and hath given `it' to him in reference to whom he hath been guilty."
4005008,4,5,8,"`And if the man have no redeemer to restore the guilt to, the guilt which is restored `is' Jehovah's, the priest's, apart from the ram of the atonements, whereby he maketh atonement for him."

4005014,4,5,14,"and a spirit of jealousy hath passed over him, and he hath been jealous of his wife, and she hath been defiled; -- or, a spirit of jealousy hath passed over him, and he hath been jealous of his wife, and she hath not been defiled --"
4005015,4,5,15,"`Then hath the man brought in his wife unto the priest, and he hath brought in her offering for her, a tenth of the ephah of barley meal, he doth not pour on it oil, nor doth he put on it frankincense, for it `is' a present of jealousy, a present of memorial, causing remembrance of iniquity."
4005016,4,5,16,"`And the priest hath brought her near, and hath caused her to stand before Jehovah,"
4005017,4,5,17,"and the priest hath taken holy water in an earthen vessel, and of the dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle doth the priest take, and hath put `it' into the water,"
4005018,4,5,18,"and the priest hath caused the woman to stand before Jehovah, and hath uncovered the woman's head, and hath given into her hands the present of the memorial, it `is' a present of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest are the bitter waters which cause the curse."
4005019,4,5,19,"`And the priest hath caused her to swear, and hath said unto the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not turned aside `to' uncleanness under thy husband, be free from these bitter waters which cause the curse;"
4005020,4,5,20,"and thou, if thou hast turned aside under thy husband, and if thou hast been defiled, and any man doth give his copulation to thee besides thy husband --"
4005021,4,5,21,"(then the priest hath caused the woman to swear with an oath of execration, and the priest hath said to the woman) -- Jehovah doth give thee for an execration, and for a curse, in the midst of thy people, in Jehovah's giving thy thigh to fall, and thy belly to swell,"
4005022,4,5,22,"and these waters which cause the curse have gone into thy bowels, to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall; and the woman hath said, Amen, Amen."

4005027,4,5,27,"yea, he hath caused her to drink the water, and it hath come to pass, if she hath been defiled, and doth commit a trespass against her husband, that the waters which cause the curse have gone into her for bitter things, and her belly hath swelled, and her thigh hath fallen, and the woman hath become an execration in the midst of her people."
4005028,4,5,28,"`And if the woman hath not been defiled, and is clean, then she hath been acquitted, and hath been sown `with' seed."
4005029,4,5,29,"`This `is' the law of jealousies, when a wife turneth aside under her husband, and hath been defiled,"
4005030,4,5,30,"or when a spirit of jealousy passeth over a man, and he hath been jealous of his wife, then he hath caused the woman to stand before Jehovah, and the priest hath done to her all this law,"
4005031,4,5,31,"and the man hath been acquitted from iniquity, and that woman doth bear her iniquity.'"
4006001,4,6,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4006002,4,6,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When a man or woman doeth singularly, by vowing a vow of a Nazarite, to be separate to Jehovah;"
4006003,4,6,3,"from wine and strong drink he doth keep separate; vinegar of wine, and vinegar of strong drink he doth not drink, and any juice of grapes he doth not drink, and grapes moist or dry he doth not eat;"
4006004,4,6,4,"all days of his separation, of anything which is made of the wine-vine, from kernels even unto husk, he doth not eat."
4006005,4,6,5,`All days of the vow of his separation a razor doth not pass over his head; till the fulness of the days which he doth separate to Jehovah he is holy; grown up hath the upper part of the hair of his head.

4006007,4,6,7,"for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister -- he is not unclean for them at their death, for the separation of his God `is' on his head;"
4006008,4,6,8,all days of his separation he `is' holy to Jehovah.
4006009,4,6,9,"`And when the dead dieth beside him in an instant, suddenly, and he hath defiled the head of his separation, then he hath shaved his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he doth shave it,"
4006010,4,6,10,"and on the eighth day he bringeth in two turtle-doves or two young pigeons unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting,"
4006011,4,6,11,"and the priest hath prepared one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering, and hath made atonement for him, because of that which he hath sinned by the body, and he hath hallowed his head on that day;"
4006012,4,6,12,"and he hath separated to Jehovah the days of his separation, and he hath brought in a lamb, a son of a year, for a guilt-offering, and the former days are fallen, for his separation hath been defiled."
4006013,4,6,13,"`And this `is' the law of the Nazarite; in the day of the fulness of the days of his separation doth `one' bring him in unto the opening of the tent of meeting,"
4006014,4,6,14,"and he hath brought near his offering to Jehovah, one he-lamb, a son of a year, a perfect one, for a burnt-offering, and one she-lamb, a daughter of a year, a perfect one, for a sin-offering, and one ram, a perfect one, for peace-offerings,"
4006015,4,6,15,"and a basket of unleavened things of flour, cakes mixed with oil, and thin cakes of unleavened things anointed with oil, and their present, and their libations."

4006018,4,6,18,"`And the Nazarite hath shaved (at the opening of the tent of meeting) the head of his separation, and hath taken the hair of the head of his separation, and hath put `it' on the fire which `is' under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings."
4006019,4,6,19,"`And the priest hath taken the boiled shoulder from the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and hath put on the palms of the Nazarite after his shaving his separation;"
4006020,4,6,20,"and the priest hath waved them, a wave-offering before Jehovah; it `is' holy to the priest, besides the breast of the wave-offering, and besides the leg of the heave-offering; and afterwards doth the Nazarite drink wine."
4006021,4,6,21,"`This `is' the law of the Nazarite, who voweth his offering to Jehovah for his separation, apart from that which his hand attaineth; according to his vow which he voweth so he doth by the law of his separation.'"

4010032,4,10,32,"and it hath come to pass when thou goest with us, yea, it hath come to pass -- that good which Jehovah doth kindly with us -- it we have done kindly to thee.'"
4010033,4,10,33,"And they journey from the mount of Jehovah a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is journeying before them the journey of three days, to spy out for them a resting-place;"
4010034,4,10,34,"and the cloud of Jehovah `is' on them by day, in their journeying from the camp."
4010035,4,10,35,"And it cometh to pass in the journeying of the ark, that Moses saith, `Rise, O Jehovah, and Thine enemies are scattered, and those hating Thee flee from Thy presence.'"
4010036,4,10,36,"And in its resting he saith, `Return, O Jehovah, `to' the myriads, the thousands of Israel.'"
4011001,4,11,1,"And the people is evil, as those sighing habitually in the ears of Jehovah, and Jehovah heareth, and His anger burneth, and the fire of Jehovah burneth among them, and consumeth in the extremity of the camp."
4011002,4,11,2,"And the people cry unto Moses, and Moses prayeth unto Jehovah, and the fire is quenched;"
4011003,4,11,3,"and he calleth the name of that place Taberah, for the fire of Jehovah hath `burned' among them."
4011004,4,11,4,"And the rabble who `are' in its midst have lusted greatly, and the sons of Israel also turn back and weep, and say, `Who doth give us flesh?"
4011005,4,11,5,"We have remembered the fish which we do eat in Egypt for nought, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick;"
4011006,4,11,6,"and now our soul `is' dry, there is not anything, save the manna, before our eyes.'"
4011007,4,11,7,"And the manna is as coriander seed, and its aspect as the aspect of bdolach;"
4011008,4,11,8,"the people have turned aside and gathered `it', and ground `it' with millstones, or beat `it' in a mortar, and boiled `it' in a pan, and made it cakes, and its taste hath been as the taste of the moisture of oil."
4011009,4,11,9,"And in the descending of the dew on the camp by night, the manna descendeth upon it."
4011010,4,11,10,"And Moses heareth the people weeping by its families, each at the opening of his tent, and the anger of Jehovah burneth exceedingly, and in the eyes of Moses `it is' evil."
4011011,4,11,11,"And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Why hast Thou done evil to Thy servant? and why have I not found grace in Thine eyes -- to put the burden of all this people upon me?"
4011012,4,11,12,"I -- have I conceived all this people? I -- have I begotten it, that Thou sayest unto me, Carry it in thy bosom as the nursing father beareth the suckling, unto the ground which Thou hast sworn to its fathers?"
4011013,4,11,13,"Whence have I flesh to give to all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give to us flesh, and we eat."
4011014,4,11,14,"I am not able -- I alone -- to bear all this people, for `it is' too heavy for me;"
4011015,4,11,15,"and if thus Thou art doing to me -- slay me, I pray Thee; slay, if I have found grace in thine eyes, and let me not look on mine affliction.'"
4011016,4,11,16,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou hast known that they are elders of the people, and its authorities; and thou hast taken them unto the tent of meeting, and they have stationed themselves there with thee,"
4011017,4,11,17,"and I have come down and spoken with thee there, and have kept back of the Spirit which `is' upon thee, and have put on them, and they have borne with thee some of the burden of the people, and thou dost not bear `it' thyself alone."
4011018,4,11,18,"`And unto the people thou dost say, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow, and ye have eaten flesh (for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who doth give us flesh? for we `had' good in Egypt) -- and Jehovah hath given to you flesh, and ye have eaten."
4011019,4,11,19,"Ye do not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days; --"
4011020,4,11,20,"unto a month of days, till that it come out from your nostrils, and it hath become to you an abomination; because that ye have loathed Jehovah, who `is' in your midst, and weep before Him, saying, Why is this? -- we have come out of Egypt!'"
4011021,4,11,21,"And Moses saith, `Six hundred thousand footmen `are' the people in whose midst I `am'; and Thou, Thou hast said, Flesh I give to them, and they have eaten, a month of days!"
4011022,4,11,22,"Is flock and herd slaughtered for them, that one hath found for them? -- are all the fishes of the sea gathered for them -- that one hath found for them?'"
4011023,4,11,23,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Is the hand of Jehovah become short? now thou dost see whether My word meeteth thee or not.'"
4011024,4,11,24,"And Moses goeth out, and speaketh unto the people the words of Jehovah, and gathereth seventy men of the elders of the people, and causeth them to stand round about the tent,"
4011025,4,11,25,"and Jehovah cometh down in the cloud, and speaketh unto him, and keepeth back of the Spirit which `is' on him, and putteth on the seventy men of the elders; and it cometh to pass at the resting of the Spirit on them, that they prophesy, and do not cease."
4011026,4,11,26,"And two of the men are left in the camp, the name of the one `is' Eldad, and the name of the second Medad, and the spirit resteth upon them, (and they are among those written, and have not gone out to the tent), and they prophesy in the camp;"
4011027,4,11,27,"and the young man runneth, and declareth to Moses, and saith, `Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.'"
4011028,4,11,28,"And Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, `one' of his young men, answereth and saith, `My lord Moses, restrain them.'"
4011029,4,11,29,"And Moses saith to him, `Art thou zealous for me? O that all Jehovah's people were prophets! that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!'"
4011030,4,11,30,"And Moses is gathered unto the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
4011031,4,11,31,"And a spirit hath journeyed from Jehovah, and cutteth off quails from the sea, and leaveth by the camp, as a day's journey here, and as a day's journey there, round about the camp, and about two cubits, on the face of the land."
4011032,4,11,32,"And the people rise all that day, and all the night, and all the day after, and gather the quails -- he who hath least hath gathered ten homers -- and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp."
4011033,4,11,33,"The flesh is yet between their teeth -- it is not yet cut off -- and the anger of Jehovah hath burned among the people, and Jehovah smiteth among the people -- a very great smiting;"
4011034,4,11,34,"and `one' calleth the name of that place Kibroth-Hattaavah, for there they have buried the people who lust."
4011035,4,11,35,"From Kibroth-Hattaavah have the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they are in Hazeroth."
4012001,4,12,1,And Miriam speaketh -- Aaron also -- against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken: for a Cushite woman he had taken;
4012002,4,12,2,"and they say, `Only by Moses hath Jehovah spoken? also by us hath he not spoken?' and Jehovah heareth."
4012003,4,12,3,"And the man Moses `is' very humble, more than any of the men who `are' on the face of the ground."
4012004,4,12,4,"And Jehovah saith suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, `Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting;' and they three come out."
4012005,4,12,5,"And Jehovah cometh down in the pillar of the cloud, and standeth at the opening of the tent, and calleth Aaron and Miriam, and they come out both of them."
4012006,4,12,6,"And He saith, `Hear, I pray you, My words: If your prophet is of Jehovah -- in an appearance unto him I make Myself known; in a dream I speak with him;"
4012007,4,12,7,not so My servant Moses; in all My house he `is' stedfast;
4012008,4,12,8,"mouth unto mouth I speak with him, and `by' an appearance, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah he beholdeth attentively; and wherefore have ye not been afraid to speak against My servant -- against Moses?'"
4012009,4,12,9,"And the anger of Jehovah burneth against them, and He goeth on,"
4012010,4,12,10,"and the cloud hath turned aside from off the tent, and lo, Miriam `is' leprous as snow; and Aaron turneth unto Miriam, and lo, leprous!"
4012011,4,12,11,"And Aaron saith unto Moses, `O, my lord, I pray thee, lay not upon us sin `in' which we have been foolish, and `in' which we have sinned;"
4012012,4,12,12,"let her not, I pray thee, be as `one' dead, when in his coming out from the womb of his mother -- the half of his flesh is consumed.'"
4012013,4,12,13,"And Moses crieth unto Jehovah, saying, `O God, I pray Thee, give, I pray Thee, healing to her.'"
4012014,4,12,14,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `And her father had but spat in her face -- is she not ashamed seven days? she is shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterwards she is gathered.'"
4012015,4,12,15,"And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people hath not journeyed till Miriam is gathered;"
4012016,4,12,16,"and afterwards have the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and they encamp in the wilderness of Paran."
4013001,4,13,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4013002,4,13,2,"`Send for thee men, and they spy the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel; one man, one man for the tribe of his fathers ye do send, every one a prince among them.'"
4013003,4,13,3,"And Moses sendeth them from the wilderness of Paran by the command of Jehovah; all of them `are' men, heads of the sons of Israel they are,"
4013004,4,13,4,"and these their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur."
4013005,4,13,5,"For the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori."
4013006,4,13,6,"For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh."
4013007,4,13,7,"For the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph."
4013008,4,13,8,"For the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea, son of Nun."
4013009,4,13,9,"For the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu."
4013010,4,13,10,"For the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi."
4013011,4,13,11,"For the tribe of Joseph, (for the tribe of Manasseh,) Gaddi son of Susi."
4013012,4,13,12,"For the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli."
4013013,4,13,13,"For the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael."
4013014,4,13,14,"For the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vopshi."
4013015,4,13,15,"For the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi."
4013016,4,13,16,"These `are' the names of the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land; and Moses calleth Hoshea son of Nun, Jehoshua."
4013017,4,13,17,"And Moses sendeth them to spy the land of Canaan, and saith unto them, `Go ye up this `way' into the south, and ye have gone up the mountain,"
4013018,4,13,18,"and have seen the land what it `is', and the people which is dwelling on it, whether it `is' strong or feeble; whether it `is' few or many;"
4013019,4,13,19,"and what the land `is' in which it is dwelling, whether it `is' good or bad; and what `are' the cities in which it is dwelling, whether in camps or in fortresses;"
4013020,4,13,20,"And what the land `is', whether it `is' fat or lean; whether there is wood in it or not; and ye have strengthened yourselves, and have taken of the fruit of the land;' and the days `are' days of the first-fruits of grapes."
4013021,4,13,21,"And they go up and spy the land, from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob at the going in to Hamath;"
4013022,4,13,22,"and they go up by the south, and come in unto Hebron, and there `are' Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak (and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt),"
4013023,4,13,23,"and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down thence a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they bear it on a staff by two, also `some' of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
4013024,4,13,24,"That place hath `one' called Brook of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from thence."
4013025,4,13,25,And they turn back from spying the land at the end of forty days.
4013026,4,13,26,"And they go and come in unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they bring them and all the company back word, and shew them the fruit of the land."
4013027,4,13,27,"And they recount to him, and say, `We came in unto the land whither thou hast sent us, and also it `is' flowing with milk and honey -- and this `is' its fruit;"
4013028,4,13,28,"only, surely the people which is dwelling in the land `is' strong; and the cities are fenced, very great; and also children of Anak we have seen there."
4013029,4,13,29,"Amalek is dwelling in the land of the south, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite is dwelling in the hill country, and the Canaanite is dwelling by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.'"
4013030,4,13,30,"And Caleb stilleth the people concerning Moses, and saith, `Let us certainly go up -- and we have possessed it; for we are thoroughly able for it.'"
4013031,4,13,31,"And the men who have gone up with him said, `We are not able to go up against the people, for it `is' stronger than we;'"
4013032,4,13,32,"and they bring out an evil account of the land which they have spied unto the sons of Israel, saying, `The land into which we passed over to spy it, is a land eating up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in its midst `are' men of stature;"
4013033,4,13,33,"and there we saw the Nephilim, sons of Anak, of the Nephilim; and we are in our own eyes as grasshoppers; and so we were in their eyes.'"
4014001,4,14,1,"And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice, and the people weep during that night;"
4014002,4,14,2,"and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses, and against Aaron, and all the company say unto them, `O that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, O that we had died!"
4014003,4,14,3,and why is Jehovah bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?'
4014004,4,14,4,"And they say one unto another, `Let us appoint a head, and turn back to Egypt.'"
4014005,4,14,5,"And Moses falleth -- Aaron also -- on their faces, before all the assembly of the company of the sons of Israel."
4014006,4,14,6,"And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of those spying the land, have rent their garments,"
4014007,4,14,7,"and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, `The land into which we have passed over to spy it, `is' a very very good land;"
4014008,4,14,8,"if Jehovah hath delighted in us, then He hath brought us in unto this land, and hath given it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey;"
4014009,4,14,9,"only, against Jehovah rebel not ye: and ye, fear not ye the people of the land, for our bread they `are'; their defence hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah `is' with us; fear them not.'"
4014010,4,14,10,"And all the company say to stone them with stones, and the honour of Jehovah hath appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the sons of Israel."
4014011,4,14,11,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Until when doth this people despise Me? and until when do they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its midst?"
4014012,4,14,12,"I smite it with pestilence, and dispossess it, and make thee become a nation greater and mightier than it.'"
4014013,4,14,13,"And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `Then have the Egyptians heard! for Thou hast brought up with Thy power this people out of their midst,"
4014014,4,14,14,"and they have said `it' unto the inhabitant of this land, they have heard that Thou, Jehovah, `art' in the midst of this people, that eye to eye Thou art seen -- O Jehovah, and Thy cloud is standing over them, -- and in a pillar of cloud Thou art going before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night."
4014015,4,14,15,"`And Thou hast put to death this people as one man, and the nations who have heard Thy fame have spoken, saying,"
4014016,4,14,16,From Jehovah's want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He hath sworn to them -- He doth slaughter them in the wilderness.
4014017,4,14,17,"`And now, let, I pray Thee, the power of my Lord be great, as Thou hast spoken, saying:"
4014018,4,14,18,"Jehovah `is' slow to anger, and of great kindness; bearing away iniquity and transgression, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third `generation', and on a fourth; --"
4014019,4,14,19,"forgive, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Thy kindness, and as Thou hast borne with this people from Egypt, even until now.'"
4014020,4,14,20,"And Jehovah saith, `I have forgiven, according to thy word;"
4014021,4,14,21,"and yet, I live -- and it is filled -- the whole earth -- `with' the honour of Jehovah;"
4014022,4,14,22,"for all the men who are seeing My honour, and My signs, which I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and try Me these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice --"
4014023,4,14,23,"they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers, yea, none of those despising Me see it;"
4014024,4,14,24,"and My servant Caleb, because there hath been another spirit with him, and he is fully after Me -- I have brought him in unto the land whither he hath entered, and his seed doth possess it."
4014025,4,14,25,`And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness -- the way of the Red Sea.'
4014026,4,14,26,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,"
4014027,4,14,27,"`Until when hath this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;"
4014028,4,14,28,"say unto them, I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- if, as ye have spoken in Mine ears -- so I do not to you;"
4014029,4,14,29,"in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years and upward, who have murmured against Me;"
4014030,4,14,30,"ye -- ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun."
4014031,4,14,31,"`As to your infants -- of whom ye have said, A spoil they are become -- I have even brought them in, and they have known the land which ye have kicked against;"
4014032,4,14,32,"as to you -- your carcases do fall in this wilderness,"
4014033,4,14,33,"and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in the wilderness;"
4014034,4,14,34,"by the number of the days `in' which ye spied the land, forty days, -- a day for a year, a day for a year -- ye do bear your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking off;"
4014035,4,14,35,"I `am' Jehovah, I have spoken; if I do not this to all this evil company who are meeting against me; -- in this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.'"
4014036,4,14,36,"And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land, and they turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by bringing out an evil account concerning the land,"
4014037,4,14,37,even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Jehovah;
4014038,4,14,38,"and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have lived of those men who go to spy out the land."
4014039,4,14,39,"And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,"
4014040,4,14,40,"and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top of the mountain, saying, `Here we `are', and we have come up unto the place which Jehovah hath spoken of, for we have sinned.'"
4014041,4,14,41,"And Moses saith, `Why `is' this? -- ye are transgressing the command of Jehovah, and it doth not prosper;"
4014042,4,14,42,"go not up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies;"
4014043,4,14,43,"for the Amalekite and the Canaanite `are' there before you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah is not with you.'"
4014044,4,14,44,"And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses have not departed out of the midst of the camp."
4014045,4,14,45,"And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down -- unto Hormah."
4015001,4,15,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4015002,4,15,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,"
4015003,4,15,3,"then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or free-will-offering, or in your appointed things, to make a sweet fragrance to Jehovah, out of the herd, or out of the flock."
4015004,4,15,4,"`And he who is bringing near his offering to Jehovah hath brought near a present of flour, a tenth deal, mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil;"
4015005,4,15,5,"and wine for a libation, a fourth of the hin thou dost prepare for the burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, for the one lamb;"
4015006,4,15,6,"or for a ram thou dost prepare a present of flour, two-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a third of the hin;"
4015007,4,15,7,"and wine for a libation, a third part of the hin, thou dost bring near -- a sweet fragrance to Jehovah."
4015008,4,15,8,"`And when thou makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or peace-offerings to Jehovah,"
4015009,4,15,9,"then he hath brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour, three-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a half of the hin;"
4015010,4,15,10,"and wine thou bringest near for a libation, a half of the hin -- a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
4015011,4,15,11,"thus it is done for the one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep or of the goats."
4015012,4,15,12,"`According to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to each, according to their number;"
4015013,4,15,13,"every native doth thus with these, at bringing near a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;"
4015014,4,15,14,"and when a sojourner sojourneth with you, or whoso `is' in your midst to your generations, and he hath made a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah, as ye do so he doth."
4015015,4,15,15,"`One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning, a statute age-during to your generations: as ye `are' so is the sojourner before Jehovah;"
4015016,4,15,16,one law and one ordinance is to you and to the sojourner who is sojourning with you.'
4015017,4,15,17,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4015018,4,15,18,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, In your coming in unto the land whither I am bringing you in,"
4015019,4,15,19,"then it hath been, in your eating of the bread of the land, ye heave up a heave-offering to Jehovah;"
4015020,4,15,20,"the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up -- a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of a threshing-floor, so ye do heave it."
4015021,4,15,21,Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Jehovah a heave-offering -- to your generations.
4015022,4,15,22,"`And when ye err, and do not all these commands which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,"
4015023,4,15,23,"the whole that Jehovah hath charged upon you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Jehovah hath commanded, and henceforth, to your generations,"
4015024,4,15,24,"then it hath been, if from the eyes of the company it hath been done in ignorance, that all the company have prepared one bullock, a son of the herd, for a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah, and its present, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering."
4015025,4,15,25,"`And the priest hath made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel, and it hath been forgiven them, for it `is' ignorance, and they -- they have brought in their offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, even their sin-offering before Jehovah for their ignorance;"
4015026,4,15,26,"and it hath been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst; for to all the company `it is done' in ignorance."
4015027,4,15,27,"`And if one person sin in ignorance, then he hath brought near a she-goat, daughter of a year, for a sin-offering;"
4015028,4,15,28,"and the priest hath made atonement for the person who is erring, in his sinning in ignorance before Jehovah, by making atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him;"
4015029,4,15,29,"for the native among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst -- one law is to you, for him who is doing `anything' through ignorance."
4015030,4,15,30,"`And the person who doth `aught' with a high hand -- of the native or of the sojourner -- Jehovah he is reviling, and that person hath been cut off from the midst of his people;"
4015031,4,15,31,"because the word of Jehovah he despised, and His command hath broken -- that person is certainly cut off; his iniquity `is' on him.'"
4015032,4,15,32,"And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness, and they find a man gathering wood on the sabbath-day,"
4015033,4,15,33,"and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company,"
4015034,4,15,34,"and they place him in ward, for it `is' not explained what is `to be' done to him."
4015035,4,15,35,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The man is certainly put to death, all the company stoning him with stones, at the outside of the camp.'"
4015036,4,15,36,"And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones, and he dieth, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
4015037,4,15,37,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4015038,4,15,38,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, and they have made for themselves fringes on the skirts of their garments, to their generations, and they have put on the fringe of the skirt a ribbon of blue,"
4015039,4,15,39,"and it hath been to you for a fringe, and ye have seen it, and have remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and have done them, and ye search not after your heart, and after your eyes, after which ye are going a-whoring;"
4015040,4,15,40,"so that ye remember and have done all My commands, and ye have been holy to your God;"
4015041,4,15,41,"I `am' Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt to become your God; I, Jehovah, `am' your God.'"
4016001,4,16,1,"And Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, taketh both Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben,"
4016002,4,16,2,"and they rise up before Moses, with men of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty, princes of the company, called of the convention, men of name,"
4016003,4,16,3,"and they are assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and say unto them, `Enough of you! for all the company -- all of them `are' holy, and in their midst `is' Jehovah; and wherefore do ye lift yourselves up above the assembly of Jehovah?'"
4016004,4,16,4,"And Moses heareth, and falleth on his face,"
4016005,4,16,5,"and he speaketh unto Korah, and unto all his company, saying, `Morning! -- and Jehovah is knowing those who are his, and him who is holy, and hath brought near unto Him; even him whom He doth fix on He bringeth near unto Him."
4016006,4,16,6,"This do: take to yourselves censers, Korah, and all his company,"
4016007,4,16,7,"and put in them fire, and put on them perfume, before Jehovah to-morrow, and it hath been, the man whom Jehovah chooseth, he `is' the holy one; -- enough of you, sons of Levi.'"
4016008,4,16,8,"And Moses saith unto Korah, `Hear ye, I pray you, sons of Levi;"
4016009,4,16,9,"is it little to you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the company of Israel to bring you near unto Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the company to serve them? --"
4016010,4,16,10,"yea, He doth bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee -- and ye have sought also the priesthood!"
4016011,4,16,11,"Therefore, thou and all thy company who are met `are' against Jehovah; and Aaron, what `is' he, that ye murmur against him?'"
4016012,4,16,12,"And Moses sendeth to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons of Eliab, and they say, `We do not come up;"
4016013,4,16,13,is it little that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in a wilderness that thou also certainly makest thyself prince over us?
4016014,4,16,14,"Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey thou hast not brought us in, nor dost thou give to us an inheritance of field and vineyard; the eyes of these men dost thou pick out? we do not come up.'"
4016015,4,16,15,"And it is very displeasing to Moses, and he saith unto Jehovah, `Turn not Thou unto their present; not one ass from them have I taken, nor have I afflicted one of them.'"
4016016,4,16,16,"And Moses saith unto Korah, `Thou and all thy company, be ye before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;"
4016017,4,16,17,"and take ye each his censer, and ye have put on them perfume, and brought near before Jehovah, each his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; and thou and Aaron, each his censer.'"
4016018,4,16,18,"And they take each his censer, and put on them fire, and lay on them perfume, and they stand at the opening of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron."
4016019,4,16,19,"And Korah assembleth against them all the company unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the honour of Jehovah is seen by all the company."
4016020,4,16,20,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
4016021,4,16,21,"`Be ye separated from the midst of this company, and I consume them in a moment;'"
4016022,4,16,22,"and they fall on their faces, and say, `God, God of the spirits of all flesh -- the one man sinneth, and against all the company Thou art wroth!'"
4016023,4,16,23,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4016024,4,16,24,"`Speak unto the company, saying, Go ye up from round about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'"
4016025,4,16,25,"And Moses riseth, and goeth unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel go after him,"
4016026,4,16,26,"and he speaketh unto the company, saying, `Turn aside, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and come not against anything that they have, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.'"
4016027,4,16,27,"And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, from round about, and Dathan, and Abiram have come out, standing at the opening of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their infants."
4016028,4,16,28,"And Moses saith, `By this ye do know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works, that `they are' not from my own heart;"
4016029,4,16,29,if according to the death of all men these die -- or the charge of all men is charged upon them -- Jehovah hath not sent me;
4016030,4,16,30,"and if a strange thing Jehovah do, and the ground hath opened her mouth and swallowed them, and all that they have, and they have gone down alive to Sheol -- then ye have known that these men have despised Jehovah.'"
4016031,4,16,31,"And it cometh to pass at his finishing speaking all these words, that the ground which `is' under them cleaveth,"
4016032,4,16,32,"and the earth openeth her mouth, and swalloweth them, and their houses, and all the men who `are' for Korah, and all the goods,"
4016033,4,16,33,"and they go down, they, and all that they have, alive to Sheol, and the earth closeth over them, and they perish from the midst of the assembly;"
4016034,4,16,34,"and all Israel who `are' round about them have fled at their voice, for they said, `Lest the earth swallow us;'"
4016035,4,16,35,"and fire hath come out from Jehovah, and consumeth the two hundred and fifty men bringing near the perfume."
4016036,4,16,36,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4016037,4,16,37,"`Say unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, and he lifteth up the censers from the midst of the burning, and the fire scatter thou yonder, for they have been hallowed,"
4016038,4,16,38,"`even' the censers of these sinners against their own souls; and they have made them spread-out plates, a covering for the altar, for they have brought them near before Jehovah, and they are hallowed; and they are become a sign to the sons of Israel.'"
4016039,4,16,39,"And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which they who are burnt had brought near, and they spread them out, a covering for the altar --"
4016040,4,16,40,"a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that a stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron doth not draw near to make a perfume before Jehovah, and is not as Korah, and as his company, -- as Jehovah hath spoken by the hand of Moses to him."
4016041,4,16,41,"And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur, on the morrow, against Moses and against Aaron, saying, `Ye -- ye have put to death the people of Jehovah.'"
4016042,4,16,42,"And it cometh to pass, in the company being assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they turn towards the tent of meeting, and lo, the cloud hath covered it, and the honour of Jehovah is seen;"
4016043,4,16,43,and Moses cometh -- Aaron also -- unto the front of the tent of meeting.
4016044,4,16,44,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4016045,4,16,45,"`Get you up from the midst of this company, and I consume them in a moment;' and they fall on their faces,"
4016046,4,16,46,"and Moses saith unto Aaron, `Take the censer, and put on it fire from off the altar, and place perfume, and go, hasten unto the company, and make atonement for them, for the wrath hath gone out from the presence of Jehovah -- the plague hath begun.'"
4016047,4,16,47,"And Aaron taketh as Moses hath spoken, and runneth unto the midst of the assembly, and lo, the plague hath begun among the people; and he giveth the perfume, and maketh atonement for the people,"
4016048,4,16,48,"and standeth between the dead and the living, and the plague is restrained;"
4016049,4,16,49,"and those who die by the plague are fourteen thousand and seven hundred, apart from those who die for the matter of Korah;"
4016050,4,16,50,"and Aaron turneth back unto Moses, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the plague hath been restrained."
4017001,4,17,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4017002,4,17,2,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and take from them each a rod, for a father's house, from all their princes, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods; the name of each thou dost write on his rod,"
4017003,4,17,3,and Aaron's name thou dost write on the tribe of Levi; for one rod `is' for the head of their fathers' house:
4017004,4,17,4,"and thou hast placed them in the tent of meeting, before the testimony, where I meet with you."
4017005,4,17,5,"`And it hath come to pass, the man's rod on whom I fix doth flourish, and I have caused to cease from off me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you.'"
4017006,4,17,6,"And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and all their princes give unto him one rod for a prince, one rod for a prince, for their fathers' house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron `is' in the midst of their rods;"
4017007,4,17,7,"and Moses placeth the rods before Jehovah, in the tent of the testimony."
4017008,4,17,8,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Moses goeth in unto the tent of the testimony, and lo, the rod of Aaron hath flourished for the house of Levi, and is bringing out flourishing, and doth blossom blossoms, and doth produce almonds;"
4017009,4,17,9,"and Moses bringeth out all the rods from before Jehovah, unto all the sons of Israel, and they look, and take each his rod."
4017010,4,17,10,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, for a charge, for a sign to the sons of rebellion, and thou dost remove their murmurings from off me, and they do not die;'"
4017011,4,17,11,and Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him; so he hath done.
4017012,4,17,12,"And the sons of Israel speak unto Moses, saying, `Lo, we have expired; we have perished; we have all of us perished;"
4017013,4,17,13,any who is at all drawing near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah dieth; have we not been consumed -- to expire?'
4018001,4,18,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy father with thee, do bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou, and thy sons with thee, do bear the iniquity of your priesthood;"
4018002,4,18,2,"and also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring near with thee, and they are joined unto thee, and serve thee, even thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of the testimony."
4018003,4,18,3,"`And they have kept thy charge, and the charge of all the tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or you;"
4018004,4,18,4,"and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger doth not come near unto you;"
4018005,4,18,5,"and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the sons of Israel."
4018006,4,18,6,"`And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting;"
4018007,4,18,7,"and thou, and thy sons with thee, do keep your priesthood, for everything of the altar, and within the vail, and ye have served; a service of gift I make your priesthood; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'"
4018008,4,18,8,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I, lo, I have given to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel -- to thee I have given them for the anointing, and to thy sons, by a statute age-during."
4018009,4,18,9,"This is thine of the most holy things, from the fire: all their offering, to all their present, and to all their sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to thy sons;"
4018010,4,18,10,in the holy of holies thou dost eat it; every male doth eat it; holy it is to thee.
4018011,4,18,11,"`And this `is' thine: the heave-offering of their gift, to all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, to thee I have given them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;"
4018012,4,18,12,"all the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and wheat -- their first-`fruits' which they give to Jehovah -- to thee I have given them."
4018013,4,18,13,"`The first-fruits of all that `is' in their land, which they bring in to Jehovah, are thine; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;"
4018014,4,18,14,"every devoted thing in Israel is thine,"
4018015,4,18,15,"every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring near to Jehovah, among man and among beast, is thine; only, thou dost certainly ransom the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean beast thou dost ransom."
4018016,4,18,16,"`And their ransomed ones from a son of a month, thou dost ransom with thy valuation, of silver, five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs it `is'."
4018017,4,18,17,"`Only, the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou dost not ransom, holy they `are': their blood thou dost sprinkle on the altar, and of their fat thou makest perfume, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah,"
4018018,4,18,18,"and their flesh is thine, as the breast of the wave-offering, and as the right leg, it is thine;"
4018019,4,18,19,"all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Jehovah I have given to thee and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during, a covenant of salt, age-during it `is' before Jehovah, to thee and to thy seed with thee.'"
4018020,4,18,20,"And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `In their land thou dost not inherit, and a portion thou hast not in their midst: I `am' thy portion, and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel;"
4018021,4,18,21,"and to the sons of Levi, lo, I have given all the tenth in Israel for inheritance in exchange for their service which they are serving -- the service of the tent of meeting."
4018022,4,18,22,"`And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of meeting, to bear sin, to die,"
4018023,4,18,23,"and the Levites have done the service of the tent of meeting, and they -- they bear their iniquity; a statute age-during to your generations, that in the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance;"
4018024,4,18,24,"but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Jehovah, a heave-offering, I have given to the Levites for inheritance; therefore I have said of them, In the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance.'"
4018025,4,18,25,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4018026,4,18,26,"`And unto the Levites thou dost speak; and thou hast said unto them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given to you from them, for your inheritance, then ye have lifted up from it the heave-offering of Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe;"
4018027,4,18,27,"and your heave-offering hath been reckoned to you as corn from the threshing-floor, and as fulness from the wine-vat;"
4018028,4,18,28,so ye do lift up -- ye also -- the heave-offering of Jehovah from all your tithes which ye receive from the sons of Israel; and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Jehovah to Aaron the priest;
4018029,4,18,29,"out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole heave-offering of Jehovah; out of all its fat, -- its hallowed part -- out of it."
4018030,4,18,30,"`And thou hast said unto them, In your lifting up its fat out of it, then it hath been reckoned to the Levites, as increase of a threshing-floor, and as increase of a wine-vat;"
4018031,4,18,31,"and ye have eaten it in every place, ye and your households, for it `is' your hire in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting;"
4018032,4,18,32,"and ye bear no sin for it, in your lifting up its fat out of it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye do not pollute, and ye die not.'"
4019001,4,19,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,"
4019002,4,19,2,"`This `is' a statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee a red cow, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish, on which no yoke hath gone up;"
4019003,4,19,3,"and ye have given it unto Eleazar the priest, and he hath brought it out unto the outside of the camp, and hath slaughtered it before him."
4019004,4,19,4,"`And Eleazar the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger, and hath sprinkled over-against the front of the tent of meeting of her blood seven times;"
4019005,4,19,5,"and `one' hath burnt the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, besides her dung, he doth burn;"
4019006,4,19,6,"and the priest hath taken cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and hath cast unto the midst of the burning of the cow;"
4019007,4,19,7,"and the priest hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards doth come in unto the camp, and the priest is unclean till the evening;"
4019008,4,19,8,"and he who is burning it doth wash his garments with water, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and is unclean till the evening."
4019009,4,19,9,"`And a clean man hath gathered the ashes of the cow, and hath placed at the outside of the camp, in a clean place, and it hath become to the company of the sons of Israel a charge for waters of separation -- it `is' a `cleansing';"
4019010,4,19,10,"and he who is gathering the ashes of the heifer hath washed his garments, and is unclean till the evening; and it hath been to the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst, for a statute age-during."
4019011,4,19,11,`He who is coming against the dead body of any man -- is unclean seven days;
4019012,4,19,12,"he doth cleanse himself for it on the third day, and on the seventh day he is clean; and if he cleanse not himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he is not clean."
4019013,4,19,13,"Any one who is coming against the dead, against the body of man who dieth, and cleanseth not himself -- the tabernacle of Jehovah he hath defiled, and that person hath been cut off from Israel, for water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness `is' still upon him."
4019014,4,19,14,"`This `is' the law, when a man dieth in a tent: every one who is coming in unto the tent, and all that `is' in the tent, is unclean seven days;"
4019015,4,19,15,and every open vessel which hath no covering of thread upon it is unclean.
4019016,4,19,16,"`And every one who cometh, on the face of the field, against the pierced of a sword, or against the dead, or against a bone of man, or against a grave, is unclean seven days;"
4019017,4,19,17,"and they have taken for the unclean person of the ashes of the burning of the `cleansing', and he hath put upon it running water unto a vessel;"
4019018,4,19,18,"and a clean person hath taken hyssop, and hath dipped `it' in water, and hath sprinkled on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who have been there, and on him who is coming against a bone, or against one pierced, or against the dead, or against a grave."
4019019,4,19,19,"`And the clean hath sprinkled `it' on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day, and hath cleansed him on the seventh day, and he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and hath been clean in the evening."
4019020,4,19,20,"`And the man who is unclean, and doth not cleanse himself, even that person hath been cut off from the midst of the assembly; for the sanctuary of Jehovah he hath defiled; water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he `is' unclean."
4019021,4,19,21,"`And it hath been to them for a statute age-during, that he who is sprinkling the water of separation doth wash his garments, and he who is coming against the water of separation is unclean till the evening,"
4019022,4,19,22,"and all against which the unclean person cometh is unclean, and the person who is coming against `it' is unclean till the evening.'"
4020001,4,20,1,"And the sons of Israel come in, -- all the company -- to the wilderness of Zin, in the first month, and the people abide in Kadesh, and Miriam dieth there, and is buried there."
4020002,4,20,2,"And there hath been no water for the company, and they are assembled against Moses, and against Aaron,"
4020003,4,20,3,"and the people strive with Moses, and speak, saying, `And oh that we had expired when our brethren expired before Jehovah!"
4020004,4,20,4,"and why have ye brought in the assembly of Jehovah unto this wilderness to die there, we and our beasts?"
4020005,4,20,5,"and why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? no place of seed, and fig, and vine, and pomegranate; and water there is none to drink."
4020006,4,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron go in from the presence of the assembly unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and fall on their faces, and the honour of Jehovah is seen by them."
4020007,4,20,7,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4020008,4,20,8,"`Take the rod, and assemble the company, thou and Aaron thy brother; and ye have spoken unto the rock before their eyes, and it hath given its water, and thou hast brought out to them water from the rock, and hast watered the company, and their beasts.'"
4020009,4,20,9,"And Moses taketh the rod from before Jehovah, as He hath commanded him,"
4020010,4,20,10,"and Moses and Aaron assemble the assembly unto the front of the rock, and he saith to them, `Hear, I pray you, O rebels, from this rock do we bring out to you water?'"
4020011,4,20,11,"and Moses lifteth up his hand, and smiteth the rock with his rod twice; and much water cometh out, and the company drink, also their beasts."
4020012,4,20,12,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, and unto Aaron, `Because ye have not believed in Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye do not bring in this assembly unto the land which I have given to them.'"
4020013,4,20,13,"These `are' waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel have `striven' with Jehovah, and He is sanctified upon them."
4020014,4,20,14,"And Moses sendeth messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, `Thus said thy brother Israel, Thou -- thou hast known all the travail which hath found us;"
4020015,4,20,15,"that our fathers go down to Egypt, and we dwell in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians do evil to us and to our fathers;"
4020016,4,20,16,"and we cry unto Jehovah, and He heareth our voice, and sendeth a messenger, and is bringing us out of Egypt; and lo, we `are' in Kadesh, a city `in' the extremity of thy border."
4020017,4,20,17,"Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land; we pass not over through a field, or through a vineyard, nor do we drink waters of a well; the way of the king we go, we turn not aside -- right or left -- till that we pass over thy border.'"
4020018,4,20,18,"And Edom saith unto him, `Thou dost not pass over through me, lest with sword I come out to meet thee.'"
4020019,4,20,19,"And the sons of Israel say unto him, `In the highway we go, and if of thy waters we drink -- I and my cattle -- then I have given their price; only (it is nothing) on my feet I pass over.'"
4020020,4,20,20,"And he saith, `Thou dost not pass over;' and Edom cometh out to meet him with much people, and with a strong hand;"
4020021,4,20,21,"and Edom refuseth to suffer Israel to pass over through his border, and Israel turneth aside from off him."
4020022,4,20,22,"And the sons of Israel, the whole company, journey from Kadesh, and come in unto mount Hor,"
4020023,4,20,23,"and Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron in mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,"
4020024,4,20,24,"`Aaron is gathered unto his people, for he doth not go in unto the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because that ye provoked My mouth at the waters of Meribah."
4020025,4,20,25,"`Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and cause them to go up mount Hor,"
4020026,4,20,26,"and strip Aaron of his garments, and thou hast clothed `with' them Eleazar his son, and Aaron is gathered, and doth die there.'"
4020027,4,20,27,"And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded, and they go up unto mount Hor before the eyes of all the company,"
4020028,4,20,28,"and Moses strippeth Aaron of his garments, and clotheth with them Eleazar his son, and Aaron dieth there on the top of the mount; and Moses cometh down -- Eleazar also -- from the mount,"
4020029,4,20,29,"and all the company see that Aaron hath expired, and they bewail Aaron thirty days -- all the house of Israel."
4021001,4,21,1,"And the Canaanite -- king Arad -- dwelling in the south, heareth that Israel hath come the way of the Atharim, and he fighteth against Israel, and taketh `some' of them captive."
4021002,4,21,2,"And Israel voweth a vow to Jehovah, and saith, `If Thou dost certainly give this people into my hand, then I have devoted their cities;'"
4021003,4,21,3,"and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Israel, and giveth up the Canaanite, and he devoteth them and their cities, and calleth the name of the place Hormah."
4021004,4,21,4,"And they journey from mount Hor, the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom, and the soul of the people is short in the way,"
4021005,4,21,5,"and the people speak against God, and against Moses, `Why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to die in a wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul hath been weary of this light bread.'"
4021006,4,21,6,"And Jehovah sendeth among the people the burning serpents, and they bite the people, and much people of Israel die;"
4021007,4,21,7,"and the people come in unto Moses and say, `We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, and He doth turn aside from us the serpent;' and Moses prayeth in behalf of the people."
4021008,4,21,8,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Make for thee a burning `serpent', and set it on an ensign; and it hath been, every one who is bitten and hath seen it -- he hath lived."
4021009,4,21,9,"And Moses maketh a serpent of brass, and setteth it on the ensign, and it hath been, if the serpent hath bitten any man, and he hath looked expectingly unto the serpent of brass -- he hath lived."
4021010,4,21,10,"And the sons of Israel journey, and encamp in Oboth."
4021011,4,21,11,"And they journey from Oboth, and encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the wilderness that `is' on the front of Moab, at the rising of the sun."
4021012,4,21,12,"From thence they have journeyed, and encamp in the valley of Zared."
4021013,4,21,13,"From thence they have journeyed, and encamp beyond Arnon, which `is' in the wilderness which is coming out of the border of the Amorite, for Arnon `is' the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorite;"
4021014,4,21,14,"therefore it is said in a book, `The wars of Jehovah,' -- `Waheb in Suphah, And the brooks of Arnon;"
4021015,4,21,15,"And the spring of the brooks, Which turned aside to the dwelling of Ar, And hath leaned to the border of Moab.'"
4021016,4,21,16,"And from thence `they journeyed' to Beer; it `is' the well `concerning' which Jehovah said to Moses, `Gather the people, and I give to them -- water.'"
4021017,4,21,17,"Then singeth Israel this song, concerning the well -- they have answered to it:"
4021018,4,21,18,"`A well -- digged it have princes, Prepared it have nobles of the people, With the lawgiver, with their staves.' And from the wilderness `they journeyed' to Mattanah,"
4021019,4,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,"
4021020,4,21,20,"and from Bamoth in the valley which `is' in the field of Moab `to' the top of Pisgah, which hath looked on the front of the wilderness."
4021021,4,21,21,"And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorite, saying,"
4021022,4,21,22,"`Let me pass through thy land, we do not turn aside into a field, or into a vineyard, we do not drink waters of a well; in the king's way we go, till that we pass over thy border.'"
4021023,4,21,23,"And Sihon hath not suffered Israel to pass through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and cometh out to meet Israel into the wilderness, and cometh in to Jahaz, and fighteth against Israel."
4021024,4,21,24,"And Israel smiteth him by the mouth of the sword, and possesseth his land from Arnon unto Jabbok -- unto the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon `is' strong."
4021025,4,21,25,"And Israel taketh all these cities, and Israel dwelleth in all the cities of the Amorite, in Heshbon, and in all its villages;"
4021026,4,21,26,"for Heshbon is a city of Sihon king of the Amorite, and he hath fought against the former king of Moab, and taketh all his land out of his hand, unto Arnon;"
4021027,4,21,27,"therefore those using similes say -- `Enter ye Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and ready,"
4021028,4,21,28,"For fire hath gone out from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon, It hath consumed Ar of Moab, Owners of the high places of Arnon."
4021029,4,21,29,"Wo to thee, O Moab, Thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh, He hath given his sons who escape -- Also his daughters -- Into captivity, to a king of the Amorite -- Sihon!"
4021030,4,21,30,"And we shoot them, Perished hath Heshbon unto Dibon, And we make desolate unto Nophah, Which `is' unto Medeba.'"
4021031,4,21,31,"And Israel dwelleth in the land of the Amorite,"
4021032,4,21,32,"and Moses sendeth to spy out Jaazer, and they capture its villages, and dispossess the Amorite who `is' there,"
4021033,4,21,33,"and turn and go up the way of Bashan, and Og king of Bashan cometh out to meet them, he and all his people, to battle, `at' Edrei."
4021034,4,21,34,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Fear him not, for into thy hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and thou hast done to him as thou hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon.'"
4021035,4,21,35,"And they smite him, and his sons, and all his people, until he hath not left to him a remnant, and they possess his land."
4022001,4,22,1,"And the sons of Israel journey and encamp in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, `by' Jericho."
4022002,4,22,2,"And Balak son of Zippor seeth all that Israel hath done to the Amorite,"
4022003,4,22,3,"and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people, for it `is' numerous; and Moab is vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel,"
4022004,4,22,4,"and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, `Now doth the assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor `is' king of Moab at that time,"
4022005,4,22,5,"and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which `is' by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, `Lo, a people hath come out of Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is abiding over-against me;"
4022006,4,22,6,"and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for it `is' mightier than I; it may be I prevail -- we smite it -- and I cast it out from the land; for I have known -- that which thou blessest is blessed, and that which thou cursest is cursed.'"
4022007,4,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and speak unto him the words of Balak,"
4022008,4,22,8,"and he saith unto them, `Lodge here to-night, and I have brought you back word, as Jehovah speaketh unto me;' and the princes of Moab abide with Balaam."
4022009,4,22,9,"And God cometh in unto Balaam, and saith, `Who `are' these men with thee?'"
4022010,4,22,10,"And Balaam saith unto God, `Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me:"
4022011,4,22,11,"Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth the eye of the land, -- now come, pierce it for me; it may be I am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;'"
4022012,4,22,12,"and God saith unto Balaam, `Thou dost not go with them; thou dost not curse the people; for it `is' blessed.'"
4022013,4,22,13,"And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saith unto the princes of Balak, `Go unto your land, for Jehovah is refusing to suffer me to go with you;'"
4022014,4,22,14,"and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and say, `Balaam is refusing to come with us.'"
4022015,4,22,15,"And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and honoured than these,"
4022016,4,22,16,"and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, `Thus said Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming unto me,"
4022017,4,22,17,"for very greatly I honour thee, and all that thou sayest unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this people.'"
4022018,4,22,18,"And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak, `If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah my God, to do a little or a great thing;"
4022019,4,22,19,"and, now, abide, I pray you, in this `place', you also, to-night; and I know what Jehovah is adding to speak with me.'"
4022020,4,22,20,"And God cometh in unto Balaam, by night, and saith to him, `If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and only the thing which I speak unto thee -- it thou dost do.'"
4022021,4,22,21,"And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and goeth with the princes of Moab,"
4022022,4,22,22,"and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a messenger of Jehovah stationeth himself in the way for an adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his servants `are' with him,"
4022023,4,22,23,"and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside out of the way, and goeth into a field, and Balaam smiteth the ass to turn it aside into the way."
4022024,4,22,24,And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards -- a wall on this `side' and a wall on that --
4022025,4,22,25,"and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and is pressed unto the wall, and presseth Balaam's foot unto the wall, and he addeth to smite her;"
4022026,4,22,26,"and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over, and standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside -- right or left --"
4022027,4,22,27,"and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and croucheth under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth the ass with a staff."
4022028,4,22,28,"And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass, and she saith to Balaam, `What have I done to thee that thou hast smitten me these three times?'"
4022029,4,22,29,"and Balaam saith to the ass, `Because thou hast rolled thyself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for now I had slain thee;'"
4022030,4,22,30,"and the ass saith unto Balaam, `Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden since `I was' thine unto this day? have I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?' and he saith, `No.'"
4022031,4,22,31,"And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he seeeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and he boweth and doth obeisance, to his face;"
4022032,4,22,32,"and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him, `Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? lo, I -- I have come out for an adversary, for `thy' way hath been perverse before me,"
4022033,4,22,33,"and the ass seeth me, and turneth aside at my presence these three times; unless she had turned aside from my presence, surely now also, thee I had slain, and her kept alive.'"
4022034,4,22,34,"And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `I have sinned, for I did not know that thou `art' standing to meet me in the way; and now, if evil in thine eyes -- I turn back by myself.'"
4022035,4,22,35,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam, `Go with the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee -- it thou dost speak;' and Balaam goeth with the princes of Balak."
4022036,4,22,36,"And Balak heareth that Balaam hath come, and goeth out to meet him, unto a city of Moab, which `is' on the border of Arnon, which `is' in the extremity of the border;"
4022037,4,22,37,"and Balak saith unto Balaam, `Did I not diligently sent unto thee to call for thee? why didst thou not come unto me? am I not truly able to honour thee?'"
4022038,4,22,38,"And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Lo, I have come unto thee; now -- am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God setteth in my mouth -- it I do speak.'"
4022039,4,22,39,"And Balaam goeth with Balak, and they come to Kirjath-Huzoth,"
4022040,4,22,40,"and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sendeth to Balaam, and to the princes who `are' with him;"
4022041,4,22,41,"and it cometh to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh Balaam, and causeth him to go up the high places of Baal, and he seeth from thence the extremity of the people."
4023001,4,23,1,"And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Build for me in this `place' seven altars, and make ready for me in this `place' seven bullocks and seven rams.'"
4023002,4,23,2,"And Balak doth as Balaam hath spoken, and Balak -- Balaam also -- offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar,"
4023003,4,23,3,"and Balaam saith to Balak, `Station thyself by thy burnt-offering and I go on, it may be Jehovah doth come to meet me, and the thing which He sheweth me -- I have declared to thee;' and he goeth `to' a high place."
4023004,4,23,4,"And God cometh unto Balaam, and he saith unto Him, `The seven altars I have arranged, and I offer a bullock and a ram on the altar;'"
4023005,4,23,5,"and Jehovah putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.'"
4023006,4,23,6,"And he turneth back unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, he and all the princes of Moab."
4023007,4,23,7,"And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `From Aram he doth lead me -- Balak king of Moab; From mountains of the east: Come -- curse for me Jacob, And come -- be indignant `with' Israel."
4023008,4,23,8,What -- do I pierce? -- God hath not pierced! And what -- am I indignant? -- Jehovah hath not been indignant!
4023009,4,23,9,"For from the top of rocks I see it, And from heights I behold it; Lo a people! alone it doth tabernacle, And among nations doth not reckon itself."
4023010,4,23,10,"Who hath counted the dust of Jacob, And the number of the fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of upright ones, And let my last end be like his!'"
4023011,4,23,11,"And Balak saith unto Balaam, `What hast thou done to me? to pierce mine enemies I have taken thee -- and lo, thou hast certainly blessed;'"
4023012,4,23,12,"and he answereth and saith, `That which Jehovah doth put in my mouth -- it do I not take heed to speak?'"
4023013,4,23,13,"And Balak saith unto him, `Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, whence thou dost see it, only its extremity thou dost see, and all of it thou dost not see, and pierce it for me thence;'"
4023014,4,23,14,"and he taketh him `to' the field of Zophim, unto the top of Pisgah, and buildeth seven altars, and offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar."
4023015,4,23,15,"And he saith unto Balak, `Station thyself here by thy burnt-offering, and I -- I meet `Him' there;'"
4023016,4,23,16,"and Jehovah cometh unto Balaam, and setteth a word in his mouth, and saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.'"
4023017,4,23,17,"And he cometh unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him, and Balak saith to him: `What hath Jehovah spoken?'"
4023018,4,23,18,"And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Rise, Balak, and hear; Give ear unto me, son of Zippor!"
4023019,4,23,19,"God `is' not a man -- and lieth, And a son of man -- and repenteth! Hath He said -- and doth He not do `it'? And spoken -- and doth He not confirm it?"
4023020,4,23,20,"Lo, to bless I have received: Yea, He blesseth, and I `can'not reverse it."
4023021,4,23,21,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Nor hath He seen perverseness in Israel; Jehovah his God `is' with him, And a shout of a king `is' in him."
4023022,4,23,22,"God is bringing them out from Egypt, As the swiftness of a Reem is to him;"
4023023,4,23,23,"For no enchantment `is' against Jacob, Nor divination against Israel, At the time it is said of Jacob and Israel, What hath God wrought!"
4023024,4,23,24,"Lo, the people as a lioness riseth, And as a lion he lifteth himself up, He lieth not down till he eateth prey, And blood of pierced ones doth drink.'"
4023025,4,23,25,"And Balak saith unto Balaam, `Neither pierce it at all, nor bless it at all;'"
4023026,4,23,26,"and Balaam answereth and saith unto Balak, `Have I not spoken unto thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh -- it I do?'"
4023027,4,23,27,"And Balak saith unto Balaam, `Come, I pray thee, I take thee unto another place; it may be it is right in the eyes of God -- to pierce it for me from thence.'"
4023028,4,23,28,"And Balak taketh Balaam to the top of Peor, which is looking on the front of the wilderness,"
4023029,4,23,29,"and Balaam saith unto Balak, `Build for me in this `place' seven altars, and make ready for me in this `place' seven bullocks and seven rams;'"
4023030,4,23,30,"and Balak doth as Balaam said, and he offereth a bullock and a ram on an altar."
4024001,4,24,1,"And Balaam seeth that `it is' good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he hath not gone as time by time to meet enchantments, and he setteth towards the wilderness his face;"
4024002,4,24,2,"and Balaam lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Israel tabernacling, by its tribes, and the Spirit of God is upon him,"
4024003,4,24,3,"and he taketh up his simile, and saith: `An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor -- And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut --"
4024004,4,24,4,"An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God -- Who a vision of the Almighty seeth, Falling -- and eyes uncovered:"
4024005,4,24,5,"How good have been thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel;"
4024006,4,24,6,"As valleys they have been stretched out, As gardens by a river; As aloes Jehovah hath planted, As cedars by waters;"
4024007,4,24,7,"He maketh water flow from his buckets, And his seed `is' in many waters; And higher than Agag `is' his king, And exalted is his kingdom."
4024008,4,24,8,"God is bringing him out of Egypt; As the swiftness of a Reem is to him, He eateth up nations his adversaries, And their bones he breaketh, And `with' his arrows he smiteth,"
4024009,4,24,9,"He hath bent, he hath lain down as a lion, And as a lioness: who doth raise him up? He who is blessing thee `is' blessed, And he who is cursing thee `is' cursed.'"
4024010,4,24,10,"And the anger of Balak burneth against Balaam, and he striketh his hands; and Balak saith unto Balaam, `To pierce mine enemies I called thee, and lo, thou hast certainly blessed -- these three times;"
4024011,4,24,11,"and now, flee for thyself unto thy place; I have said, I do greatly honour thee, and lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honour.'"
4024012,4,24,12,"And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Did I not also unto thy messengers whom thou hast sent unto me, speak, saying,"
4024013,4,24,13,"If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah, to do good or evil of mine own heart -- that which Jehovah speaketh -- it I speak?"
4024014,4,24,14,"and, now, lo, I am going to my people; come, I counsel thee `concerning' that which this people doth to thy people, in the latter end of the days.'"
4024015,4,24,15,"And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor -- And an affirmation of the man whose eyes `are' shut --"
4024016,4,24,16,"An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God -- And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he seeth, Falling -- and eyes uncovered:"
4024017,4,24,17,"I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not near; A star hath proceeded from Jacob, And a sceptre hath risen from Israel, And hath smitten corners of Moab, And hath destroyed all sons of Sheth."
4024018,4,24,18,"And Edom hath been a possession, And Seir hath been a possession, `for' its enemies, And Israel is doing valiantly;"
4024019,4,24,19,"And `one' doth rule out of Jacob, And hath destroyed a remnant from Ar.'"
4024020,4,24,20,"And he seeth Amalek, and taketh up his simile, and saith: `A beginning of the Goyim `is' Amalek; And his latter end -- for ever he perisheth.'"
4024021,4,24,21,"And he seeth the Kenite, and taketh up his simile, and saith: `Enduring `is' thy dwelling, And setting in a rock thy nest,"
4024022,4,24,22,But the Kenite is for a burning; Till when doth Asshur keep thee captive?'
4024023,4,24,23,"And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Alas! who doth live when God doth this?"
4024024,4,24,24,"And -- ships `are' from the side of Chittim, And they have humbled Asshur, And they have humbled Eber, And it also for ever is perishing.'"
4024025,4,24,25,"And Balaam riseth, and goeth, and turneth back to his place, and Balak also hath gone on his way."

4029030,4,29,30,"and their present, and their libations, for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance;"
4029031,4,29,31,"and one goat, a sin-offering; apart from the continual burnt-offering, its present, and its libation."

4029035,4,29,35,"`On the eighth day a restraint ye have, ye do no servile work;"
4029036,4,29,36,"and ye have brought near a burnt-offering, a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Jehovah; one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;"
4029037,4,29,37,"their present, and their libations, for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance;"

4029040,4,29,40,And Moses saith unto the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
4030001,4,30,1,"And Moses speaketh unto the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded:"
4030002,4,30,2,"`When a man voweth a vow to Jehovah, or hath sworn an oath to bind a bond on his soul, he doth not pollute his word; according to all that is going out from his mouth he doth."
4030003,4,30,3,"`And when a woman voweth a vow to Jehovah, and hath bound a bond in the house of her father in her youth,"
4030004,4,30,4,"and her father hath heard her vow, and her bond which she hath bound on her soul, and her father hath kept silent at her, then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she hath bound on her soul is established."
4030005,4,30,5,"`And if her father hath disallowed her in the day of his hearing, none of her vows and her bonds which she hath bound on her soul is established, and Jehovah is propitious to her, for her father hath disallowed her."
4030006,4,30,6,"`And if she be at all to a husband, and her vows `are' on her, or a wrongful utterance `on' her lips, which she hath bound on her soul,"
4030007,4,30,7,"and her husband hath heard, and in the day of his hearing, he hath kept silent at her, then have her vows been established, and her bonds which she hath bound on her soul are established."
4030008,4,30,8,"`And if in the day of her husband's hearing he disalloweth her, then he hath broken her vow which `is' on her, and the wrongful utterance of her lips which she hath bound on her soul, and Jehovah is propitious to her."
4030009,4,30,9,"`As to the vow of a widow or cast-out woman, all that she hath bound on her soul is established on her."
4030010,4,30,10,"`And if `in' the house of her husband she hath vowed, or hath bound a bond on her soul with an oath,"
4030011,4,30,11,"and her husband hath heard, and hath kept silent at her -- he hath not disallowed her -- then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she hath bound on her soul is established."
4030012,4,30,12,"`And if her husband doth certainly break them in the day of his hearing, none of the outgoing of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, is established -- her husband hath broken them -- and Jehovah is propitious to her."
4030013,4,30,13,"`Every vow and every oath -- a bond to humble a soul -- her husband doth establish it, or her husband doth break it;"
4030014,4,30,14,"and if her husband certainly keep silent at her, from day unto day, then he hath established all her vows, or all her bonds which `are' upon her; he hath established them, for he hath kept silent at her in the day of his hearing;"
4030015,4,30,15,"and if he doth at all break them after his hearing, then he hath borne her iniquity.'"
4030016,4,30,16,"These `are' the statutes which Jehovah hath commanded Moses between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her youth, `in' the house of her father."
4031001,4,31,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4031002,4,31,2,`Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the Midianites -- afterwards thou art gathered unto thy people.'
4031003,4,31,3,"And Moses speaketh unto the people, saying, `Be ye armed some of you for the host, and they are against Midian, to put the vengeance of Jehovah on Midian;"
4031004,4,31,4,"a thousand for a tribe -- a thousand for a tribe, to all the tribes of Israel -- ye do send to the host.'"
4031005,4,31,5,"And there are given out of the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed ones of the host;"
4031006,4,31,6,"and Moses sendeth them, a thousand for a tribe, to the host, them and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, to the host; and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the shouting, in his hand."
4031007,4,31,7,"And they war against Midian, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses, and slay every male;"
4031008,4,31,8,"and the kings of Midian they have slain, besides their pierced ones, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam son of Beor, they have slain with the sword."
4031009,4,31,9,"And the sons of Israel take captive the women of Midian, and their infants; and all their cattle, and all their substance, and all their wealth they have plundered;"
4031010,4,31,10,"and all their cities, with their habitations, and all their towers, they have burnt with fire."
4031011,4,31,11,"And they take all the spoil, and all the prey, among man and among beast;"
4031012,4,31,12,"and they bring in, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the company of the sons of Israel, the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto the camp, unto the plains of Moab, which `are' by Jordan, `near' Jericho."
4031013,4,31,13,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the company, go out to meet them, unto the outside of the camp,"
4031014,4,31,14,"and Moses is wroth against the inspectors of the force, chiefs of the thousands, and chiefs of the hundreds, who are coming in from the host of the battle."
4031015,4,31,15,"And Moses saith unto them, `Have ye kept alive every female?"
4031016,4,31,16,"lo, they -- they have been to the sons of Israel, through the word of Balaam, to cause a trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and the plague is in the company of Jehovah."
4031017,4,31,17,"`And now, slay ye every male among the infants, yea, every woman known of man by the lying of a male ye have slain;"
4031018,4,31,18,"and all the infants among the women, who have not known the lying of a male, ye have kept alive for yourselves."
4031019,4,31,19,"`And ye, encamp ye at the outside of the camp seven days -- any who hath slain a person, and any who hath come against a pierced one, ye cleanse yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day -- ye and your captives;"
4031020,4,31,20,"and every garment, and every skin vessel, and every work of goats' `hair', and every wooden vessel, ye yourselves cleanse.'"
4031021,4,31,21,"And Eleazar the priest saith unto the men of the host who go in to battle, `This `is' the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:"
4031022,4,31,22,"only, the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,"
4031023,4,31,23,"every thing which may go into fire, ye cause to pass over through fire, and it hath been clean; only, with the water of separation it is cleansed, and all that may not go into fire, ye cause to pass over through water;"
4031024,4,31,24,"and ye have washed your garments on the seventh day, and have been clean, and afterwards ye come in unto the camp.'"
4031025,4,31,25,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4031026,4,31,26,"`Take up the sum of the prey of the captives, among man and among beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the company;"
4031027,4,31,27,and thou hast halved the prey between those handling the battle who go out to the host and all the company;
4031028,4,31,28,"and thou hast raised a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war, who go out to the host, one body out of five hundred, of man, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock;"
4031029,4,31,29,"from their half ye do take, and thou hast given to Eleazar the priest -- the heave-offering of Jehovah."
4031030,4,31,30,"`And from the sons of Israel's half thou dost take one possession out of fifty, of man, of the herd, of the asses, and of the flock, of all the cattle, and thou hast given them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.'"
4031031,4,31,31,And Moses doth -- Eleazar the priest also -- as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
4031032,4,31,32,"And the prey, the residue of the spoil which the people of the host have spoiled, is of the flock six hundred thousand, and seventy thousand, and five thousand;"
4031033,4,31,33,and of the herd two and seventy thousand;
4031034,4,31,34,and of asses one and sixty thousand;
4031035,4,31,35,and of human beings -- of the women who have not known the lying of a male -- all the persons `are' two and thirty thousand.
4031036,4,31,36,"And the half -- the portion of those who go out into the host -- the number of the flock is three hundred thousand, and thirty thousand, and seven thousand and five hundred."
4031037,4,31,37,And the tribute to Jehovah of the sheep is six hundred five and seventy;
4031038,4,31,38,"and the herd `is' six and thirty thousand, and their tribute to Jehovah `is' two and seventy;"
4031039,4,31,39,"and the asses `are' thirty thousand and five hundred, and their tribute to Jehovah `is' one and sixty;"
4031040,4,31,40,"and the human beings `are' sixteen thousand, and their tribute to Jehovah `is' two and thirty persons."
4031041,4,31,41,"And Moses giveth the tribute -- Jehovah's heave-offering -- to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
4031042,4,31,42,"And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses halved from the men who war --"
4031043,4,31,43,"and the company's half is, of the flock three hundred thousand, and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred;"
4031044,4,31,44,and of the herd six and thirty thousand;
4031045,4,31,45,and of asses thirty thousand and five hundred;
4031046,4,31,46,and of human beings sixteen thousand --
4031047,4,31,47,"Moses taketh from the sons of Israel's half the one possession from the fifty, of man and of beast, and giveth them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."
4031048,4,31,48,"And the inspectors whom the thousands of the host hath, (heads of the thousands and heads of the hundreds), draw near unto Moses,"
4031049,4,31,49,"and they say unto Moses, `Thy servants have taken up the sum of the men of war who `are' with us, and not a man of us hath been missed;"
4031050,4,31,50,"and we bring near Jehovah's offering, each that which he hath found, vessels of gold -- chain, and bracelet, seal-ring, `ear'-ring, and bead -- to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.'"
4031051,4,31,51,"And Moses receiveth -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold from them, every made vessel,"
4031052,4,31,52,"and all the gold of the heave-offering which they have lifted up to Jehovah is sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from heads of the thousands, and from heads of the hundreds;"
4031053,4,31,53,(the men of the host have spoiled each for himself);
4031054,4,31,54,"and Moses taketh -- Eleazar the priest also -- the gold from the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds, and they bring it in unto the tent of meeting -- a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah."
4032001,4,32,1,"And much cattle hath been to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad, very many; and they see the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, and lo, the place `is' a place `for' cattle;"
4032002,4,32,2,"and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Reuben, come in and speak unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the company, saying:"
4032003,4,32,3,"`Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon --"
4032004,4,32,4,"the land which Jehovah hath smitten before the company of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.'"
4032005,4,32,5,"And they say, `If we have found grace in thine eyes, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession; cause us not to pass over the Jordan.'"
4032006,4,32,6,"And Moses saith to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, `Do your brethren go in to the battle, and ye -- do ye sit here?"
4032007,4,32,7,and why discourage ye the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over unto the land which Jehovah hath given to them?
4032008,4,32,8,`Thus did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land;
4032009,4,32,9,"and they go up unto the valley of Eshcol, and see the land, and discourage the heart of the sons of Israel so as not to go in unto the land which Jehovah hath given to them;"
4032010,4,32,10,"and the anger of Jehovah burneth in that day, and He sweareth, saying,"
4032011,4,32,11,"They do not see -- the men who are coming up out of Egypt from a son of twenty years and upward -- the ground which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, for they have not been fully after Me;"
4032012,4,32,12,"save Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they have been fully after Jehovah;"
4032013,4,32,13,"and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He causeth them to wander in the wilderness forty years, until the consumption of all the generation which is doing the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah."
4032014,4,32,14,"`And lo, ye have risen in the stead of your fathers, an increase of men -- sinners, to add yet to the fury of the anger of Jehovah toward Israel;"
4032015,4,32,15,"when ye turn back from after Him, then He hath added yet to leave him in the wilderness, and ye have done corruptly to all this people.'"
4032016,4,32,16,"And they come nigh unto him, and say, `Folds for the flock we build for our cattle here, and cities for our infants;"
4032017,4,32,17,and we -- we are armed hasting before the sons of Israel till that we have brought them in unto their place; and our infants have dwelt in the cities of defence because of the inhabitants of the land;
4032018,4,32,18,"we do not turn back unto our houses till the sons of Israel have inherited each his inheritance,"
4032019,4,32,19,"for we do not inherit with them beyond the Jordan and yonder, for our inheritance hath come unto us beyond the Jordan at the `sun'-rising.'"
4032020,4,32,20,"And Moses saith unto them, `If ye do this thing: if ye are armed before Jehovah for battle,"
4032021,4,32,21,"and every armed one of you hath passed over the Jordan before Jehovah, till his dispossessing His enemies from before Him,"
4032022,4,32,22,"and the land hath been subdued before Jehovah -- then afterwards ye do turn back, and have been acquitted by Jehovah, and by Israel; and this land hath been to you for a possession before Jehovah."
4032023,4,32,23,"`And if ye do not so, lo, ye have sinned against Jehovah, and know ye your sin, that it doth find you;"
4032024,4,32,24,"build for yourselves cities for your infants, and folds for your flock, and that which is going out from your mouth do ye.'"
4032025,4,32,25,"And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben speak unto Moses, saying, `Thy servants do as my lord is commanding;"
4032026,4,32,26,"our infants, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts, are there in cities of Gilead,"
4032027,4,32,27,"and thy servants pass over, every armed one of the host, before Jehovah, to battle, as my lord is saying.'"
4032028,4,32,28,"And Moses commandeth concerning them Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel;"
4032029,4,32,29,"and Moses saith unto them, `If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben pass over with you the Jordan, every one armed for battle, before Jehovah, and the land hath been subdued before you, then ye have given to them the land of Gilead for a possession;"
4032030,4,32,30,"and if they do not pass over armed with you, then they have possessions in your midst in the land of Canaan.'"
4032031,4,32,31,"And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answer, saying, `That which Jehovah hath spoken unto thy servants -- so we do;"
4032032,4,32,32,"we -- we pass over armed before Jehovah `to' the land of Canaan, and with us `is' the possession of our inheritance beyond the Jordan.'"
4032033,4,32,33,"And Moses giveth to them, to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorite, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land by its cities, in the borders, the cities of the land round about."
4032034,4,32,34,"And the sons of Gad build Dihon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,"
4032035,4,32,35,"and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,"
4032036,4,32,36,"and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran, cities of defence, and sheepfolds."
4032037,4,32,37,"And the sons of Reuben have build Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,"
4032038,4,32,38,"and Nebo, and Baal-Meon (changed in name), and Shibmah, and they call by `these' names the names of the cities which they have built."
4032039,4,32,39,"And sons of Machir son of Manasseh go to Gilead, and capture it, and dispossess the Amorite, who `is' in it;"
4032040,4,32,40,"and Moses giveth Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he dwelleth in it."
4032041,4,32,41,"And Jair son of Manasseh hath gone and captureth their towns, and calleth them `Towns of Jair;'"

4033051,4,33,51,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye are passing over the Jordan unto the land of Canaan,"
4033052,4,33,52,"then ye have dispossessed all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and have destroyed all their imagery, yea, all their molten images ye destroy, and all their high places ye lay waste,"
4033053,4,33,53,"and ye have possessed the land, and dwelt in it, for to you I have given the land -- to possess it."
4033054,4,33,54,"`And ye have inherited the land by lot, by your families; to the many ye increase their inheritance, and to the few ye diminish their inheritance; whither the lot goeth out to him, it is his; by the tribes of your fathers ye inherit."
4033055,4,33,55,"`And if ye do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it hath been, those whom ye let remain of them, `are' for pricks in your eyes, and for thorns in your sides, and they have distressed you on the land in which ye are dwelling,"
4033056,4,33,56,"and it hath come to pass, as I thought to do to them -- I do to you.'"
4034001,4,34,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4034002,4,34,2,"`Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye are coming in unto the land of Canaan -- this `is' the land which falleth to you by inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders --"
4034003,4,34,3,"then hath the south quarter been to you from the wilderness of Zin, by the sides of Edom, yea, the south border hath been to you from the extremity of the Salt Sea, eastward;"
4034004,4,34,4,"and the border hath turned round to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and hath passed on to Zin, and its outgoings have been from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it hath gone out at Hazar-Addar, and hath passed on to Azmon;"
4034005,4,34,5,"and the border hath turned round from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its outgoings have been at the sea."
4034006,4,34,6,"`As to the west border, even the great sea hath been to you a border; this is to you the west border."
4034007,4,34,7,`And this is to you the north border: from the great sea ye mark out for yourselves mount Hor;
4034008,4,34,8,"from mount Hor ye mark out to go in to Hamath, and the outgoings of the border have been to Zedad;"
4034009,4,34,9,"and the border hath gone out to Ziphron, and its outgoings have been at Hazar-Enan; this is to you the north border."
4034010,4,34,10,"`And ye have marked out for yourselves for the border eastward, from Hazar-Enan to Shepham;"
4034011,4,34,11,"and the border hath gone down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east of Ain, and the border hath gone down, and hath smitten against the shoulder of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;"
4034012,4,34,12,"and the border hath gone down to the Jordan, and its outgoings have been at the Salt Sea; this is for you the land by its borders round about.'"
4034013,4,34,13,"And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, saying, `This `is' the land which ye inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half of the tribe;"
4034014,4,34,14,"for the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received, by the house of their fathers; and the tribe of the children of Gad, by the house of their fathers; and the half of the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance;"
4034015,4,34,15,"the two tribes and the half of the tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan, `near' Jericho, eastward, at the `sun'-rising.'"
4034016,4,34,16,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4034017,4,34,17,"`These `are' the names of the men who give to you the inheritance of the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun,"
4034018,4,34,18,and one prince -- one prince -- for a tribe ye do take to give the land by inheritance.
4034019,4,34,19,"`And these `are' the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;"

4034028,4,34,28,"and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, the prince Pedahel son of Ammihud.'"
4034029,4,34,29,These `are' those whom Jehovah hath commanded to give the sons of Israel inheritance in the land of Canaan.
4035001,4,35,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, `near' Jericho, saying,"
4035002,4,35,2,"`Command the sons of Israel, and they have given to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to inhabit; also a suburb for the cities round about them ye do give to the Levites."
4035003,4,35,3,"And the cities have been to them to inhabit, and their suburbs are for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts."
4035004,4,35,4,"`And the suburbs of the cities which ye give to the Levites `are', from the wall of the city and without, a thousand cubits round about."
4035005,4,35,5,"And ye have measured from the outside of the city, the east quarter, two thousand by the cubit, and the south quarter, two thousand by the cubit, and the west quarter, two thousand by the cubit, and the north quarter, two thousand by the cubit; and the city `is' in the midst; this is to them the suburbs of the cities."
4035006,4,35,6,"`And the cities which ye give to the Levites `are' the six cities of refuge, which ye give for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer, and besides them ye give forty and two cities;"
4035007,4,35,7,"all the cities which ye give to the Levites `are' forty and eight cities, them and their suburbs."
4035008,4,35,8,"And the cities which ye give `are' of the possession of the sons of Israel, from the many ye multiply, and from the few ye diminish; each, according to his inheritance which they inherit, doth give of his cities to the Levites.'"
4035009,4,35,9,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
4035010,4,35,10,"`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye are passing over the Jordan to the land of Canaan,"
4035011,4,35,11,"and have prepared to yourselves cities -- cities of refuge they are to you -- then fled thither hath a man-slayer, smiting a person unawares,"
4035012,4,35,12,"and the cities have been to you for a refuge from the redeemer, and the man-slayer doth not die till his standing before the company for judgment."
4035013,4,35,13,`As to the cities which ye give -- six `are' cities of refuge to you;
4035014,4,35,14,"the three of the cities ye give beyond the Jordan, and the three of the cities ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of refuge they are."
4035015,4,35,15,"To sons of Israel, and to a sojourner, and to a settler in their midst, are these six cities for a refuge, for the fleeing thither of any one smiting a person unawares."
4035016,4,35,16,"`And if with an instrument of iron he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
4035017,4,35,17,"`And if with a stone `in' the hand, wherewith he dieth, he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
4035018,4,35,18,"`Or with a wooden instrument `in' the hand, wherewith he dieth, he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he `is' a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death."
4035019,4,35,19,`The redeemer of blood himself doth put the murderer to death; in his coming against him he doth put him to death.

4035021,4,35,21,"or in enmity he hath smitten him with his hand, and he dieth; the smiter is certainly put to death; he `is' a murderer; the redeemer of blood doth put the murderer to death in his coming against him."
4035022,4,35,22,"`And if, in an instant, without enmity, he hath thrust him through, or hath cast at him any instrument, without lying in wait;"
4035023,4,35,23,"or with any stone wherewith he dieth, without seeing, and causeth `it' to fall upon him, and he dieth, and he `is' not his enemy, nor seeking his evil;"
4035024,4,35,24,"then have the company judged between the smiter and the redeemer of blood, by these judgments."
4035025,4,35,25,"`And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the hand of the redeemer of blood, and the company have caused him to turn back unto the city of his refuge, whither he hath fled, and he hath dwelt in it till the death of the chief priest, who hath been anointed with the holy oil."
4035026,4,35,26,"`And if the man-slayer at all go out `from' the border of the city of his refuge whither he fleeth,"
4035027,4,35,27,"and the redeemer of blood hath found him at the outside of the border of the city of his refuge, and the redeemer of blood hath slain the man-slayer, blood is not for him;"
4035028,4,35,28,for in the city of his refuge he doth dwell till the death of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest doth the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession.
4035029,4,35,29,"`And these things have been to you for a statute of judgment to your generations, in all your dwellings:"

4035031,4,35,31,"`And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who `is' condemned -- to die, for he is certainly put to death;"
4035032,4,35,32,"and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of his refuge, to turn back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest."
4035033,4,35,33,"`And ye profane not the land which ye `are' in, for blood profaneth the land; as to the land, it is not pardoned for blood which is shed in it except by the blood of him who sheddeth it;"
4035034,4,35,34,"and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling, in the midst of which I do tabernacle, for I Jehovah do tabernacle in the midst of the sons of Israel.'"
4036001,4,36,1,"And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, come near, and speak before Moses, and before the princes, heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,"
4036002,4,36,2,"and say, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my lord hath been commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters."
4036003,4,36,3,"`And -- they have been to one of the sons of the `other' tribes of the sons of Israel for wives, and their inheritance hath been withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers, and hath been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the lot of our inheritance it is withdrawn,"
4036004,4,36,4,"and if it is the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then hath their inheritance been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers is their inheritance withdrawn.'"
4036005,4,36,5,"And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, by the command of Jehovah, saying, `Rightly are the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaking;"
4036006,4,36,6,"this `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To those good in their eyes let them be for wives; only, to a family of the tribe of their fathers let them be for wives;"
4036007,4,36,7,"and the inheritance of the sons of Israel doth not turn round from tribe unto tribe; for each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers, do the sons of Israel cleave."
4036008,4,36,8,"`And every daughter possessing an inheritance, of the tribes of the sons of Israel, is to one of the family of the tribe of her father for a wife, so that the sons of Israel possess each the inheritance of his fathers,"
4036009,4,36,9,"and the inheritance doth not turn round from `one' tribe to another tribe; for each to his inheritance do they cleave, the tribes of the sons of Israel.'"
4036010,4,36,10,"As Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the daughters of Zelophehad done,"
4036011,4,36,11,"and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, are to the sons of their fathers' brethren for wives;"
4036012,4,36,12,"`to men' of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they have been for wives, and their inheritance is with the tribe of the family of their father."

5001002,5,1,2,"eleven days' from Horeb, the way of mount Seir, unto Kadesh-Barnea."
5001003,5,1,3,"And it cometh to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month hath Moses spoken unto the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him concerning them;"
5001004,5,1,4,"after his smiting Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan who is dwelling in Ashtaroth in Edrei,"
5001005,5,1,5,"beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, hath Moses begun to explain this law, saying:"
5001006,5,1,6,"`Jehovah our God hath spoken unto us in Horeb, saying, Enough to you -- of dwelling in this mount;"
5001007,5,1,7,"turn ye and journey for you, and enter the mount of the Amorite, and unto all its neighbouring places, in the plain, in the hill-country, and in the low country, and in the south, and in the haven of the sea, the land of the Canaanite, and of Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Phrat;"
5001008,5,1,8,"see, I have set before you the land; go in and possess the land which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them, and to their seed after them."
5001009,5,1,9,"`And I speak unto you at that time, saying, I am not able by myself to bear you;"
5001010,5,1,10,"Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and lo, ye `are' to-day as the stars of the heavens for multitude;"
5001011,5,1,11,"Jehovah, God of your fathers, is adding to you, as ye `are', a thousand times, and doth bless you as He hath spoken to you."
5001012,5,1,12,"`How do I bear by myself your pressure, and your burden, and your strife?"
5001013,5,1,13,"Give for yourselves men, wise and intelligent, and known to your tribes, and I set them for your heads;"
5001014,5,1,14,"and ye answer me and say, Good `is' the thing which thou hast spoken -- to do."
5001015,5,1,15,"`And I take the heads of your tribes, men, wise and known, and I appoint them heads over you, princes of thousands, and princes of hundreds, and princes of fifties, and princes of tens, and authorities, for your tribes."
5001016,5,1,16,"And I command your judges at that time, saying, Hearkening between your brethren -- then ye have judged righteousness between a man, and his brother, and his sojourner;"
5001017,5,1,17,"ye do not discern faces in judgment; as the little so the great ye do hear; ye are not afraid of the face of any, for the judgment is God's, and the thing which is too hard for you, ye bring near unto me, and I have heard it;"
5001018,5,1,18,"and I command you, at that time, all the things which ye do."
5001019,5,1,19,"`And we journey from Horeb, and go `through' all that great and fearful wilderness which ye have seen -- the way of the hill-country of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God hath commanded us, and we come in unto Kadesh-Barnea."
5001020,5,1,20,"`And I say unto you, Ye have come in unto the hill-country of the Amorite, which Jehovah our God is giving to us;"

5001022,5,1,22,"`And ye come near unto me, all of you, and say, Let us send men before us, and they search for us the land, and they bring us back word `concerning' the way in which we go up into it, and the cities unto which we come in;"
5001023,5,1,23,"and the thing is good in mine eyes, and I take of you twelve men, one man for a tribe."
5001024,5,1,24,"`And they turn and go up to the hill-country, and come in unto the valley of Eshcol, and spy it,"
5001025,5,1,25,"and they take with their hand of the fruit of the land, and bring down unto us, and bring us back word, and say, Good is the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us."
5001026,5,1,26,"`And ye have not been willing to go up, and ye provoke the mouth of Jehovah your God,"
5001027,5,1,27,"and murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah's hating us He hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorite -- to destroy us;"
5001028,5,1,28,"whither are we going up? our brethren have melted our heart, saying, A people greater and taller than we, cities great and fenced to heaven, and also sons of Anakim -- we have seen there."

5001030,5,1,30,"Jehovah your God, who is going before you -- He doth fight for you, according to all that He hath done with you in Egypt before your eyes,"
5001031,5,1,31,"and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God hath borne thee as a man beareth his son, in all the way which ye have gone, till your coming in unto this place."
5001032,5,1,32,"`And in this thing ye are not stedfast in Jehovah your God,"
5001033,5,1,33,"who is going before you in the way to search out to you a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you in the way in which ye go, and in a cloud by day."
5001034,5,1,34,"`And Jehovah heareth the voice of your words, and is wroth, and sweareth, saying,"
5001035,5,1,35,"Not one of these men of this evil generation doth see the good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,"
5001036,5,1,36,"save Caleb son of Jephunneh -- he doth see it, and to him I give the land on which he hath trodden, and to his sons, because that he hath been fully after Jehovah."
5001037,5,1,37,"`Also with me hath Jehovah been angry for your sake, saying, Also, thou dost not go in thither;"
5001038,5,1,38,"Joshua son of Nun, who is standing before thee, he goeth in thither; him strengthen thou; for he doth cause Israel to inherit."
5001039,5,1,39,"`And your infants, of whom ye have said, For a prey they are, and your sons who have not known to-day good and evil, they go in thither, and to them I give it, and they possess it;"
5001040,5,1,40,"and ye, turn for yourselves, and journey toward the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea."
5001041,5,1,41,"`And ye answer and say unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we -- we go up, and we have fought, according to all that which Jehovah our God hath commanded us; and ye gird on each his weapons of war, and ye are ready to go up into the hill-country;"
5001042,5,1,42,"and Jehovah saith unto me, Say to them, Ye do not go up, nor fight, for I am not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies."
5001043,5,1,43,"`And I speak unto you, and ye have not hearkened, and provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and act proudly, and go up into the hill-country;"
5001044,5,1,44,"and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country cometh out to meet you, and they pursue you as the bees do, and smite you in Seir -- unto Hormah."
5001045,5,1,45,"`And ye turn back and weep before Jehovah, and Jehovah hath not hearkened to your voice, nor hath he given ear unto you;"
5001046,5,1,46,"and ye dwell in Kadesh many days, according to the days which ye had dwelt."
5002001,5,2,1,"`And we turn, and journey into the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea, as Jehovah hath spoken unto me, and we go round the mount of Seir many days."
5002002,5,2,2,"`And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,"
5002003,5,2,3,Enough to you -- is the going round of this mount; turn for yourselves northward.
5002004,5,2,4,"`And the people command thou, saying, Ye are passing over into the border of your brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, and they are afraid of you; and ye have been very watchful,"
5002005,5,2,5,"ye do not strive with them, for I do not give to you of their land even the treading of the sole of a foot; for a possession to Esau I have given mount Seir."
5002006,5,2,6,"`Food ye buy from them with money, and have eaten; and also water ye buy from them with money, and have drunk,"
5002007,5,2,7,for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hands; He hath known thy walking in this great wilderness these forty years; Jehovah thy God `is' with thee; thou hast not lacked anything.
5002008,5,2,8,"`And we pass by from our brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, by the way of the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-Gaber; and we turn, and pass over the way of the wilderness of Moab;"
5002009,5,2,9,"and Jehovah saith unto me, Do not distress Moab, nor stir thyself up against them `in' battle, for I do not give to thee of their land `for' a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar `for' a possession.'"
5002010,5,2,10,"`The Emim formerly have dwelt in it, a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim;"

5002012,5,2,12,"And in Seir have the Horim dwelt formerly; and the sons of Esau dispossess them, and destroy them from before them, and dwell in their stead, as Israel hath done to the land of his possession, which Jehovah hath given to them;"
5002013,5,2,13,"now, rise ye, and pass over for yourselves the brook Zered; and we pass over the brook Zered."
5002014,5,2,14,"`And the days which we have walked from Kadesh-Barnea until that we have passed over the brook Zered, `are' thirty and eight years, till the consumption of all the generation of the men of battle from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah hath sworn to them;"
5002015,5,2,15,"and also the hand of Jehovah hath been against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, till they are consumed."
5002016,5,2,16,"`And it cometh to pass, when all the men of battle have finished dying from the midst of the people,"
5002017,5,2,17,"that Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,"
5002018,5,2,18,"Thou art passing over to-day the border of Moab, even Ar,"
5002019,5,2,19,"and thou hast come near over-against the sons of Ammon, thou dost not distress them, nor stir up thyself against them, for I do not give `any' of the land of the sons of Ammon to thee `for' a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given it `for' a possession."
5002020,5,2,20,"`A land of Rephaim it is reckoned, even it; Rephaim dwelt in it formerly, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;"

5002022,5,2,22,"as He hath done for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, when He destroyed the Horim from before them, and they dispossess them, and dwell in their stead, unto this day."
5002023,5,2,23,"`As to the Avim who are dwelling in Hazerim unto Azzah, the Caphtorim -- who are coming out from Caphtor -- have destroyed them, and dwell in their stead."
5002024,5,2,24,"`Rise ye, journey and pass over the brook Arnon; see, I have given into thy hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land; begin to possess, and stir up thyself against him `in' battle."
5002025,5,2,25,"This day I begin to put thy dread and thy fear on the face of the peoples under the whole heavens, who hear thy fame, and have trembled and been pained because of thee."
5002026,5,2,26,"`And I send messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth, unto Sihon king of Heshbon, -- words of peace -- saying,"
5002027,5,2,27,Let me pass over through thy land; in the several ways I go; I turn not aside -- right or left --
5002028,5,2,28,"food for money thou dost sell me, and I have eaten; and water for money thou dost give to me, and I have drunk; only, let me pass over on my feet, --"
5002029,5,2,29,"as the sons of Esau who are dwelling in Seir, and the Moabites who are dwelling in Ar, have done to me -- till that I pass over the Jordan, unto the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us."
5002030,5,2,30,"`And Sihon king of Heshbon hath not been willing to let us pass over by him, for Jehovah thy God hath hardened his spirit, and strengthened his heart, so as to give him into thy hand as at this day."
5002031,5,2,31,"`And Jehovah saith unto me, See, I have begun to give before thee Sihon and his land; begin to possess -- to possess his land."
5002032,5,2,32,"`And Sihon cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle to Jahaz;"
5002033,5,2,33,"and Jehovah our God giveth him before us, and we smite him, and his sons, and all his people;"
5002034,5,2,34,"and we capture all his cities at that time, and devote the whole city, men, and the women, and the infants -- we have not left a remnant;"
5002035,5,2,35,"only, the cattle we have spoiled for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we have captured."
5002036,5,2,36,"`From Aroer, which `is' by the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which `is' by the brook, even unto Gilead there hath not been a city which `is' too high for us; the whole hath Jehovah our God given before us."
5002037,5,2,37,"`Only, unto the land of the sons of Ammon thou hast not drawn near, any part of the brook Jabbok, and cities of the hill-country, and anything which Jehovah our God hath `not' commanded."
5003001,5,3,1,"`And we turn, and go up the way to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle, `to' Edrei."
5003002,5,3,2,"`And Jehovah saith unto me, Fear him not, for into thy hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and thou hast done to him as thou hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon."
5003003,5,3,3,"`And Jehovah our God giveth into our hands also Og king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smite him till there hath not been left to him a remnant;"
5003004,5,3,4,"and we capture all his cities at that time, there hath not been a city which we have not taken from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5003005,5,3,5,"All these `are' cities fenced with high walls, two-leaved doors and bar, apart from cities of villages very many;"
5003006,5,3,6,"and we devote them, as we have done to Sihon king of Heshbon, devoting every city, men, the women, and the infants;"
5003007,5,3,7,"and all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we have spoiled for ourselves."
5003008,5,3,8,"`And we take, at that time, the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorite, which is beyond the Jordan, from the brook Arnon unto mount Hermon;"
5003009,5,3,9,"(Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir,)"
5003010,5,3,10,"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan,"
5003011,5,3,11,"for only Og king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; lo, his bedstead `is' a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length, and four cubits its breadth, by the cubit of a man."
5003012,5,3,12,"`And this land we have possessed, at that time; from Aroer, which `is' by the brook Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I have given to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite;"
5003013,5,3,13,"and the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I have given to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, to all that Bashan, called the land of Rephaim."
5003014,5,3,14,"`Jair son of Manasseh hath taken all the region of Argob, unto the border of Geshuri, and Maachathi, and calleth them by his own name, Bashan-Havoth-Jair, unto this day."
5003015,5,3,15,And to Machir I have given Gilead.
5003016,5,3,16,"`And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite I have given from Gilead even unto the brook Arnon, the middle of the valley and the border, even unto Jabbok the brook, the border of the sons of Ammon,"
5003017,5,3,17,"and the plain, and the Jordan, and the border, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the springs of Pisgah, at the `sun'-rising."
5003018,5,3,18,"`And I command you, at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given to you this land to possess it; armed ye pass over before your brethren the sons of Israel, all the sons of might."
5003019,5,3,19,"Only, your wives, and your infants, and your cattle -- I have known that ye have much cattle -- do dwell in your cities which I have given to you,"
5003020,5,3,20,"till that Jehovah give rest to your brethren like yourselves, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan, then ye have turned back each to his possession, which I have given to you."
5003021,5,3,21,"`And Jehoshua I have commanded at that time, saying, Thine eyes are seeing all that which Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings -- so doth Jehovah to all the kingdoms whither thou are passing over;"
5003022,5,3,22,"fear them not, for Jehovah your God, He is fighting for you."
5003023,5,3,23,"`And I entreat for grace unto Jehovah, at that time, saying,"
5003024,5,3,24,"Lord Jehovah, Thou -- Thou hast begun to shew Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for who `is' a God in the heavens or in earth who doth according to Thy works, and according to Thy might?"
5003025,5,3,25,"Let me pass over, I pray Thee, and see the good land which `is' beyond the Jordan, this good hill-country, and Lebanon."
5003026,5,3,26,"`And Jehovah sheweth himself wroth with me, for your sake, and hath not hearkened unto me, and Jehovah saith unto me, Enough for thee; add not to speak unto Me any more about this thing:"
5003027,5,3,27,"go up `to' the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with thine eyes -- for thou dost not pass over this Jordan;"
5003028,5,3,28,"and charge Jehoshua, and strengthen him, and harden him, for he doth pass over before this people, and he doth cause them to inherit the land which thou seest."
5003029,5,3,29,`And we dwell in a valley over-against Beth-Peor.
5004001,5,4,1,"`And now, Israel, hearken unto the statutes, and unto the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye live, and have gone in, and possessed the land which Jehovah God of your fathers is giving to you."
5004002,5,4,2,"Ye do not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor diminish from it, to keep the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you."
5004003,5,4,3,"`Your eyes are seeing that which Jehovah hath done in Baal-Peor, for every man who hath gone after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed him from thy midst;"
5004004,5,4,4,"and ye who are cleaving to Jehovah your God, `are' alive, all of you, to-day."
5004005,5,4,5,"`See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, as Jehovah my God hath commanded me -- to do so, in the midst of the land whither ye are going in to possess it;"
5004006,5,4,6,"and ye have kept and done `them' (for it `is' your wisdom and your understanding) before the eyes of the peoples who hear all these statutes, and they have said, Only, a people wise and understanding `is' this great nation."
5004007,5,4,7,"`For which `is' the great nation that hath God near unto it, as Jehovah our God, in all we have called unto him?"
5004008,5,4,8,and which `is' the great nation which hath righteous statutes and judgments according to all this law which I am setting before you to-day?
5004009,5,4,9,"`Only, take heed to thyself, and watch thy soul exceedingly, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they turn aside from thy heart, all days of thy life; and thou hast made them known to thy sons, and to thy sons' sons."
5004010,5,4,10,"`The day when thou hast stood before Jehovah thy God in Horeb -- in Jehovah's saying unto me, Assemble to Me the people, and I cause them to hear My words, so that they learn to fear Me all the days that they are alive on the ground, and their sons they teach; --"
5004011,5,4,11,"and ye draw near and stand under the mountain, and the mountain is burning with fire unto the heart of the heavens -- darkness, cloud, yea, thick darkness:"
5004012,5,4,12,"`And Jehovah speaketh unto you out of the midst of the fire; a voice of words ye are hearing and a similitude ye are not seeing, only a voice;"
5004013,5,4,13,"and He declareth to you His covenant, which He hath commanded you to do, the Ten Matters, and He writeth them upon two tables of stone."
5004014,5,4,14,"`And me hath Jehovah commanded at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, for your doing them in the land whither ye are passing over to possess it;"
5004015,5,4,15,"and ye have been very watchful of your souls, for ye have not seen any similitude in the day of Jehovah's speaking unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,"
5004016,5,4,16,"lest ye do corruptly, and have made to you a graven image, a similitude of any figure, a form of male or female --"
5004017,5,4,17,a form of any beast which `is' in the earth -- a form of any winged bird which flieth in the heavens --
5004018,5,4,18,a form of any creeping thing on the ground -- a form of any fish which `is' in the waters under the earth;
5004019,5,4,19,"`And lest thou lift up thine eyes towards the heavens, and hast seen the sun, and the moon, and the stars, all the host of the heavens, and thou hast been forced, and hast bowed thyself to them, and served them, which Jehovah thy God hath apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens."
5004020,5,4,20,"`And you hath Jehovah taken, and He is bringing you out from the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be to Him for a people -- an inheritance, as `at' this day."
5004021,5,4,21,"`And Jehovah hath shewed himself wroth with me because of your words, and sweareth to my not passing over the Jordan, and to my not going in unto the good land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an inheritance;"
5004022,5,4,22,"for I am dying in this land; I am not passing over the Jordan, and ye are passing over, and have possessed this good land."
5004023,5,4,23,"`Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which He hath made with you, and have made to yourselves a graven image, a similitude of anything `concerning' which Jehovah thy God hath charged thee:"
5004024,5,4,24,for Jehovah thy God is a fire consuming -- a zealous God.
5004025,5,4,25,"`When thou begettest sons and sons' sons, and ye have become old in the land, and have done corruptly, and have made a graven image, a similitude of anything, and have done the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger: --"
5004026,5,4,26,"I have caused to testify against you this day the heavens and the earth, that ye do perish utterly hastily from off the land whither ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it; ye do not prolong days upon it, but are utterly destroyed;"
5004027,5,4,27,"and Jehovah hath scattered you among the peoples, and ye have been left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah leadeth you,"
5004028,5,4,28,"and ye have served there gods, work of man's hands, wood and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
5004029,5,4,29,"`And -- ye have sought from thence Jehovah thy God, and hast found, when thou seekest Him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,"
5004030,5,4,30,"in distress `being' to thee, and all these things have found thee, in the latter end of the days, and thou hast turned back unto Jehovah thy God, and hast hearkened to His voice;"
5004031,5,4,31,"for a merciful God `is' Jehovah thy God; He doth not fail thee, nor destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which He hath sworn to them."
5004032,5,4,32,"`For, ask, I pray thee, at the former days which have been before thee, from the day that God prepared man on the earth, and from the `one' end of the heavens even unto the `other' end of the heavens, whether there hath been as this great thing -- or hath been heard like it?"
5004033,5,4,33,"Hath a people heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, thou -- and doth live?"
5004034,5,4,34,"Or hath God tried to go in to take to Himself, a nation from the midst of a nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terrors -- according to all that Jehovah your God hath done to you, in Egypt, before your eyes?"
5004035,5,4,35,"Thou, thou hast been shewn `it', to know that Jehovah He `is' God; there is none else besides Him."
5004036,5,4,36,"`From the heavens He hath caused thee to hear His voice, to instruct thee, and on earth He hath shewed thee His great fire, and His words thou hast heard out of the midst of the fire."
5004037,5,4,37,"`And because that He hath loved thy fathers, He doth also fix on their seed after them, and doth bring thee out, in His presence, by His great power, from Egypt:"
5004038,5,4,38,"to dispossess nations greater and stronger than thou, from thy presence, to bring thee in to give to thee their land -- an inheritance, as `at' this day."
5004039,5,4,39,"`And thou hast known to-day, and hast turned `it' back unto thy heart, that Jehovah He `is' God, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath -- there is none else;"
5004040,5,4,40,"and thou hast kept His statutes and His commands which I am commanding thee to-day, so that it is well to thee, and to thy sons after thee, and so that thou prolongest days on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- all the days.'"
5004041,5,4,41,"Then Moses separateth three cities beyond the Jordan, towards the sun-rising,"
5004042,5,4,42,"for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer, who slayeth his neighbour unknowingly, and he is not hating him heretofore, and he hath fled unto one of these cities, and he hath lived:"
5004043,5,4,43,"Bezer, in the wilderness, in the land of the plain, of the Reubenite; and Ramoth, in Gilead, of the Gadite; and Golan, in Bashan, of the Manassahite."
5004044,5,4,44,And this `is' the law which Moses hath set before the sons of Israel;
5004045,5,4,45,"these `are' the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses hath spoken unto the sons of Israel, in their coming out of Egypt,"
5004046,5,4,46,"beyond the Jordan, in the valley over-against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel have smitten, in their coming out of Egypt,"
5004047,5,4,47,"and they possess his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorite who `are' beyond the Jordan, `towards' the sun-rising;"
5004048,5,4,48,"from Aroer, which `is' by the edge of the brook Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which `is' Hermon --"
5004049,5,4,49,"and all the plain beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah."
5005001,5,5,1,"And Moses calleth unto all Israel, and saith unto them, `Hear, Israel, the statutes and the judgments which I am speaking in your ears to-day, and ye have learned them, and have observed to do them."
5005002,5,5,2,Jehovah our God made with us a covenant in Horeb;
5005003,5,5,3,"not with our fathers hath Jehovah made this covenant, but with us; we -- these -- here to-day -- all of us alive."
5005004,5,5,4,"Face to face hath Jehovah spoken with you, in the mount, out of the midst of the fire;"
5005005,5,5,5,"I am standing between Jehovah and you, at that time, to declare to you the word of Jehovah, for ye have been afraid from the presence of the fire, and ye have not gone up into the mount; saying:"
5005006,5,5,6,"`I Jehovah `am' thy God, who hath brought thee out from the land of Egypt, from a house of servants."
5005007,5,5,7,`Thou hast no other gods in My presence.
5005008,5,5,8,"`Thou dost not make to thee a graven image, any similitude which `is' in the heavens above, and which `is' in the earth beneath, and which `is' in the waters under the earth;"
5005009,5,5,9,"thou dost not bow thyself to them nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God `am' a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on children, and on a third `generation', and on a fourth, to those hating Me;"
5005010,5,5,10,"and doing kindness to thousands, to those loving Me, and to those keeping My commands."
5005011,5,5,11,"`Thou dost not take up the Name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing, for Jehovah doth not acquit him who taketh up His Name for a vain thing."
5005012,5,5,12,"`Observe the day of the sabbath -- to sanctify it, as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;"
5005013,5,5,13,"six days thou dost labour, and hast done all thy work,"
5005014,5,5,14,"and the seventh day `is' a sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and thy sojourner who `is' within thy gates; so that thy man-servant, and thy handmaid doth rest like thyself;"
5005015,5,5,15,"and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God is bringing thee out thence by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm; therefore hath Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the day of the sabbath."
5005016,5,5,16,"`Honour thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee, so that thy days are prolonged, and so that it is well with thee, on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee."
5005017,5,5,17,`Thou dost not murder.

5005022,5,5,22,"`These words hath Jehovah spoken unto all your assembly, in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness -- a great voice; and He hath not added, and He writeth them on two tables of stone, and giveth them unto me."
5005023,5,5,23,"`And it cometh to pass as ye hear the voice out of the midst of the darkness, and of the mountain burning with fire, that ye come near unto me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders,"
5005024,5,5,24,"and say, Lo, Jehovah our God hath shewed us His honour, and His greatness; and His voice we have heard out of the midst of the fire; this day we have seen that God doth speak with man -- and he hath lived."
5005025,5,5,25,"`And, now, why do we die? for consume us doth this great fire -- if we add to hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more -- then we have died."

5006019,5,6,19,"to drive away all thine enemies from thy presence, as Jehovah hath spoken."
5006020,5,6,20,"`When thy son asketh thee hereafter, saying, What `are' the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?"
5006021,5,6,21,"then thou hast said to thy son, Servants we have been to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah bringeth us out of Egypt by a high hand;"
5006022,5,6,22,"and Jehovah giveth signs and wonders, great and sad, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;"

5007002,5,7,2,"and Jehovah thy God hath given them before thee, and thou hast smitten them -- thou dost utterly devote them -- thou dost not make with them a covenant, nor dost thou favour them."
5007003,5,7,3,"`And thou dost not join in marriage with them; thy daughter thou dost not give to his son, and his daughter thou dost not take to thy son,"
5007004,5,7,4,"for he doth turn aside thy son from after Me, and they have served other gods, and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you, and hath destroyed thee hastily."
5007005,5,7,5,"`But thus thou dost to them: their altars ye break down, and their standing pillars ye shiver, and their shrines ye cut down, and their graven images ye burn with fire;"
5007006,5,7,6,"for a holy people `art' thou to Jehovah thy God; on thee hath Jehovah thy God fixed, to be to Him for a peculiar people, out of all the peoples who `are' on the face of the ground."
5007007,5,7,7,"`Not because of your being more numerous than any of the peoples hath Jehovah delighted in you, and fixeth on you, for ye `are' the least of all the peoples,"
5007008,5,7,8,"but because of Jehovah's loving you, and because of His keeping the oath which He hath sworn to your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out by a strong hand, and doth ransom you from a house of servants, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
5007009,5,7,9,"`And thou hast known that Jehovah thy God He `is' God, the faithful God, keeping the covenant, and the kindness, to those loving Him, and to those keeping His commands -- to a thousand generations,"
5007010,5,7,10,"and repaying to those hating Him, unto their face, to destroy them; He delayeth not to him who is hating Him -- unto his face, He repayeth to him --"
5007011,5,7,11,"and thou hast kept the command, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I am commanding thee to-day to do them."
5007012,5,7,12,"`And it hath been, because ye hear these judgments, and have kept, and done them, that Jehovah thy God hath kept to thee the covenant and the kindness which He hath sworn to thy fathers,"
5007013,5,7,13,"and hath loved thee, and blessed thee, and multiplied thee, and hath blessed the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil, the increase of thine oxen, and the wealth of thy flock, on the ground which He hath sworn to thy fathers to give to thee."
5007014,5,7,14,"`Blessed art thou above all the peoples, there is not in thee a barren man or a barren woman -- nor among your cattle;"
5007015,5,7,15,"and Jehovah hath turned aside from thee every sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou hast known) doth He put on thee, and He hath put them on all hating thee."
5007016,5,7,16,"`And thou hast consumed all the peoples whom Jehovah thy God is giving to thee; thine eye hath no pity on them, and thou dost not serve their gods, for a snare it `is' to thee."
5007017,5,7,17,"`When thou sayest in thine heart, These nations `are' more numerous than I, how am I able to dispossess them? --"
5007018,5,7,18,"thou art not afraid of them; thou dost surely remember that which Jehovah thy God hath done to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt,"
5007019,5,7,19,"the great trials which thine eyes have seen, and the signs, and the wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched-out arm, with which Jehovah thy God hath brought thee out; so doth Jehovah thy God to all the peoples of whose presence thou art afraid."
5007020,5,7,20,"`And also the locust doth Jehovah thy God send among them, till the destruction of those who are left, and of those who are hidden from thy presence;"
5007021,5,7,21,"thou art not terrified by their presence, for Jehovah thy God `is' in thy midst, a God great and fearful."
5007022,5,7,22,"`And Jehovah thy God hath cast out these nations from thy presence little `by' little, (thou art not able to consume them hastily, lest the beast of the field multiply against thee),"
5007023,5,7,23,"and Jehovah thy God hath given them before thee, and destroyed them -- a great destruction -- till their destruction;"
5007024,5,7,24,"and He hath given their kings into thy hand, and thou hast destroyed their name from under the heavens; no man doth station himself in thy presence till thou hast destroyed them."
5007025,5,7,25,"`The graven images of their gods ye do burn with fire; thou dost not desire the silver and gold on them, nor hast thou taken `it' to thyself, lest thou be snared by it, for the abomination of Jehovah thy God it `is';"
5007026,5,7,26,"and thou dost not bring in an abomination unto thy house -- or thou hast been devoted like it; -- thou dost utterly detest it, and thou dost utterly abominate it; for it `is' devoted."
5008001,5,8,1,"`All the command which I am commanding thee to-day ye observe to do, so that ye live, and have multiplied, and gone in, and possessed the land which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers;"
5008002,5,8,2,"and thou hast remembered all the way which Jehovah thy God hath caused thee to go these forty years in the wilderness, in order to humble thee to try thee, to know that which `is' in thy heart, whether thou dost keep His commands or not."
5008003,5,8,3,"`And He doth humble thee, and cause thee to hunger and doth cause thee to eat the manna (which thou hast not known, even thy fathers have not known), in order to cause thee to know that not by bread alone doth man live, but by every produce of the mouth of Jehovah man doth live."
5008004,5,8,4,"`Thy raiment hath not worn out from off thee, and thy foot hath not swelled these forty years,"
5008005,5,8,5,"and thou hast known, with thy heart, that as a man chastiseth his son Jehovah thy God is chastising thee,"
5008006,5,8,6,"and thou hast kept the commands of Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him."
5008007,5,8,7,"`For Jehovah thy God is bringing thee in unto a good land, a land of brooks of waters, of fountains, and of depths coming out in valley and in mountain:"
5008008,5,8,8,"a land of wheat, and barley, and vine, and fig, and pomegranate; a land of oil olive and honey;"
5008009,5,8,9,"a land in which without scarcity thou dost eat bread, thou dost not lack anything in it; a land whose stones `are' iron, and out of its mountains thou dost dig brass;"
5008010,5,8,10,"and thou hast eaten, and been satisfied, and hast blessed Jehovah thy God, on the good land which he hath given to thee."
5008011,5,8,11,"`Take heed to thyself, lest thou forget Jehovah thy God so as not to keep His commands, and His judgments, and His statutes which I am commanding thee to-day;"
5008012,5,8,12,"lest thou eat, and hast been satisfied, and good houses dost build, and hast inhabited;"
5008013,5,8,13,"and thy herd and thy flock be multiplied, and silver and gold be multiplied to thee; and all that is thine be multiplied:"
5008014,5,8,14,"`And thy heart hath been high, and thou hast forgotten Jehovah thy God (who is bringing thee out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants;"
5008015,5,8,15,"who is causing thee to go in the great and the terrible wilderness -- burning serpent, and scorpion, and thirst -- where there is no water; who is bringing out to thee waters from the flinty rock;"
5008016,5,8,16,"who is causing thee to eat manna in the wilderness, which thy fathers have not known, in order to humble thee, and in order to try thee, to do thee good in thy latter end),"
5008017,5,8,17,"and thou hast said in thy heart, My power, and the might of my hand, hath made for me this wealth:"
5008018,5,8,18,"`And thou hast remembered Jehovah thy God, for He it `is' who is giving to thee power to make wealth, in order to establish His covenant which He hath sworn to thy fathers as `at' this day."
5008019,5,8,19,"`And it hath been -- if thou really forget Jehovah thy God, and hast gone after other gods, and served them, and bowed thyself to them, I have testified against you to-day that ye do utterly perish;"
5008020,5,8,20,"as the nations whom Jehovah is destroying from your presence, so ye perish; because ye hearken not to the voice of Jehovah your God."
5009001,5,9,1,"`Hear, Israel, thou art passing over to-day the Jordan, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself; cities great and fenced in the heavens;"
5009002,5,9,2,"a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom thou -- thou hast known, (and thou -- thou hast heard: Who doth station himself before sons of Anak?)"
5009003,5,9,3,"and thou hast known to-day, that Jehovah thy God `is' He who is passing over before thee -- a fire consuming; He doth destroy them, and He doth humble them before thee, and thou hast dispossessed them, and destroyed them hastily, as Jehovah hath spoken to thee."
5009004,5,9,4,"`Thou dost not speak in thy heart (in Jehovah thy God's driving them away from before thee), saying, For my righteousness hath Jehovah brought me in to possess this land, seeing for the wickedness of these nations is Jehovah dispossessing them from thy presence;"
5009005,5,9,5,"not for thy righteousness, and for the uprightness of thy heart, art thou going in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations is Jehovah thy God dispossessing them from before thee; and in order to establish the word which Jehovah hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;"
5009006,5,9,6,"and thou hast known, that not for thy righteousness is Jehovah thy God giving to thee this good land to possess it, for a people stiff of neck thou `art'."
5009007,5,9,7,`Remember -- do not forget -- that `with' which thou hast made Jehovah thy God wroth in the wilderness; even from the day that thou hast come out of the land of Egypt till your coming in unto this place rebels ye have been with Jehovah;
5009008,5,9,8,"even in Horeb ye have made Jehovah wroth, and Jehovah sheweth Himself angry against you -- to destroy you."
5009009,5,9,9,"`In my going up into the mount to receive the tables of stone (tables of the covenant which Jehovah hath made with you), and I abide in the mount forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk;"
5009010,5,9,10,"and Jehovah giveth unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them according to all the words which Jehovah hath spoken with you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly."
5009011,5,9,11,"`And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, Jehovah hath given unto me the two tables of stone -- tables of the covenant,"
5009012,5,9,12,"and Jehovah saith unto me, Rise, go down, hasten from this, for thy people hath done corruptly, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt; they have turned aside hastily out of the way which I have commanded them -- they have made to themselves a molten thing!"
5009013,5,9,13,"`And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and lo, a people stiff of neck it `is';"
5009014,5,9,14,"desist from Me, and I destroy them, and blot out their name from under the heavens, and I make thee become a nation more mighty and numerous than it."
5009015,5,9,15,"`And I turn, and come down from the mount, and the mount is burning with fire, and the two tables of the covenant on my two hands,"
5009016,5,9,16,"and I see, and lo, ye have sinned against Jehovah your God; ye have made to yourselves a molten calf; ye have turned aside hastily out of the way which Jehovah hath commanded you."
5009017,5,9,17,"`And I lay hold on the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and break them before your eyes,"
5009018,5,9,18,"and I throw myself before Jehovah, as at first, forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk, because of all your sins which ye have sinned, by doing the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry."
5009019,5,9,19,"`For I have been afraid because of the anger and the fury with which Jehovah hath been wroth against you, to destroy you; and Jehovah doth hearken unto me also at this time."
5009020,5,9,20,"`And with Aaron hath Jehovah shewed himself very angry, to destroy him, and I pray also for Aaron at that time;"
5009021,5,9,21,"and your sin, which ye have made -- the calf -- I have taken, and I burn it with fire, and beat it, grinding well till that it `is' small as dust, and I cast its dust unto the brook which is going down out of the mount."
5009022,5,9,22,"`And in Taberah, and in Massah, and in Kibroth-Hattaavah, ye have been making Jehovah wroth:"
5009023,5,9,23,"and in Jehovah's sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, Go up, and possess the land which I have given to you, then ye provoke the mouth of Jehovah your God, and have not given credence to Him, nor hearkened to His voice;"
5009024,5,9,24,rebels ye have been with Jehovah from the day of my knowing you.
5009025,5,9,25,"`And I throw myself before Jehovah, the forty days and the forty nights, as I had thrown myself, for Jehovah hath said -- to destroy you;"
5009026,5,9,26,"and I pray unto Jehovah, and say, Lord Jehovah, destroy not Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast ransomed in Thy greatness; whom Thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand;"
5009027,5,9,27,"be mindful of Thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, turn not unto the stiffness of this people, and unto its wickedness, and unto its sin;"
5009028,5,9,28,"lest the land say from which Thou hast brought us out, Because of Jehovah's want of ability to bring them in unto the land of which He hath spoken to them, and because of His hating them, He brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness;"
5009029,5,9,29,"and they `are' Thy people, and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast brought out by Thy great power, and by Thy stretched-out arm!"
5010001,5,10,1,"`At that time hath Jehovah said unto me, Grave for thee two tables of stone, like the first, and come up unto Me, into the mount, and thou hast made for thee an ark of wood,"
5010002,5,10,2,"and I write on the tables the words which were on the first tables, which thou hast broken, and thou hast placed them in the ark;"
5010003,5,10,3,"and I make an ark of shittim wood, and grave two tables of stone like the first, and go up to the mount, and the two tables in my hand."
5010004,5,10,4,"`And He writeth on the tables, according to the first writing, the Ten Matters, which Jehovah hath spoken unto you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly, and Jehovah giveth them unto me,"
5010005,5,10,5,"and I turn and come down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made, and they are there, as Jehovah commanded me."
5010006,5,10,6,"`And the sons of Israel have journeyed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera, there Aaron died, and he is buried there, and Eleazar his son doth act as priest in his stead;"
5010007,5,10,7,"thence they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water."
5010008,5,10,8,"`At that time hath Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah, to serve Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day,"
5010009,5,10,9,"therefore there hath not been to Levi a portion and inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah Himself `is' his inheritance, as Jehovah thy God hath spoken to him."
5010010,5,10,10,"`And I -- I have stood in the mount, as the former days, forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah hearkeneth unto me also at that time; Jehovah hath not willed to destroy thee."
5010011,5,10,11,"`And Jehovah saith unto me, Rise, go to journey before the people, and they go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them."
5010012,5,10,12,"`And now, Israel, what is Jehovah thy God asking from thee, except to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,"
5010013,5,10,13,"to keep the commands of Jehovah, and His statutes which I am commanding thee to-day, for good to thee?"
5010014,5,10,14,"`Lo, to Jehovah thy God `are' the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that `is' in it;"
5010015,5,10,15,"only in thy fathers hath Jehovah delighted -- to love them, and He doth fix on their seed after them -- on you, out of all the peoples as `at' this day;"
5010016,5,10,16,"and ye have circumcised the foreskin of your heart, and your neck ye do not harden any more;"
5010017,5,10,17,"for Jehovah your God -- He `is' God of the gods, and Lord of the lords; God, the great, the mighty, and the fearful; who accepteth not persons, nor taketh a bribe;"
5010018,5,10,18,"He is doing the judgment of fatherless and widow, and loving the sojourner, to give to him bread and raiment."
5010019,5,10,19,"`And ye have loved the sojourner, for sojourners ye were in the land of Egypt."
5010020,5,10,20,"`Jehovah thy God thou dost fear, Him thou dost serve, and to Him thou dost cleave, and by His name thou dost swear."
5010021,5,10,21,"He `is' thy praise, and He `is' thy God, who hath done with thee these great and fearful `things' which thine eyes have seen:"
5010022,5,10,22,"with seventy persons did thy fathers go down to Egypt, and now hath Jehovah thy God made thee as stars of the heavens for multitude."
5011001,5,11,1,"`And thou hast loved Jehovah thy God, and kept His charge, and His statutes, and His judgments, and His commands, all the days;"
5011002,5,11,2,"and ye have known to-day -- for it is not your sons who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, His greatness, His strong hand, and His stretched-out arm,"
5011003,5,11,3,"and His signs, and His doings, which He hath done in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;"
5011004,5,11,4,"and that which He hath done to the force of Egypt, to its horses, and to its chariot, when He hath caused the waters of the Red Sea to flow against their faces in their pursuing after them, and Jehovah destroyeth them, unto this day;"
5011005,5,11,5,"and that which He hath done to you in the wilderness, till your coming in unto this place;"
5011006,5,11,6,"and that which He hath done to Dathan, and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, sons of Reuben, when the earth hath opened her mouth and swalloweth them, and their houses, and their tents, and all that liveth, which is at their feet, in the midst of all Israel:"
5011007,5,11,7,"`-- But `it is' your eyes which are seeing all the great work of Jehovah, which He hath done;"
5011008,5,11,8,"and ye have kept all the command which I am commanding thee to-day, so that ye are strong, and have gone in, and possessed the land whither ye are passing over to possess it,"
5011009,5,11,9,and so that ye prolong days on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to give to them and to their seed -- a land flowing with milk and honey.
5011010,5,11,10,"`For the land whither thou art going in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt whence ye have come out, where thou sowest thy seed, and hast watered with thy foot, as a garden of the green herb;"
5011011,5,11,11,"but the land whither ye are passing over to possess it, `is' a land of hills and valleys; of the rain of the heavens it drinketh water;"
5011012,5,11,12,"a land which Jehovah thy God is searching; continually `are' the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the latter end of the year."
5011013,5,11,13,"`And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul --"
5011014,5,11,14,"that I have given the rain of your land in its season -- sprinkling and gathered -- and thou hast gathered thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil,"
5011015,5,11,15,"and I have given herbs in thy field for thy cattle, and thou hast eaten, and been satisfied."
5011016,5,11,16,"`Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be enticed, and ye have turned aside, and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them,"
5011017,5,11,17,"and the anger of Jehovah hath burned against you, and He hath restrained the heavens, and there is no rain, and the ground doth not give her increase, and ye have perished hastily from off the good land which Jehovah is giving to you."
5011018,5,11,18,"`And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and they have been for frontlets between your eyes;"
5011019,5,11,19,"and ye have taught them to your sons, by speaking of them in thy sitting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and in thy lying down, and in thy rising up,"
5011020,5,11,20,"and hast written them on the side-posts of thy house, and on thy gates,"
5011021,5,11,21,"so that your days are multiplied, and the days of your sons, on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers to give to them, as the days of the heavens on the earth."
5011022,5,11,22,"`For, if ye diligently keep all this command which I am commanding you -- to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him,"
5011023,5,11,23,"then hath Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you, and ye have possessed nations, greater and mightier than you;"
5011024,5,11,24,"every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is yours; from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Phrat, even unto the farther sea is your border;"
5011025,5,11,25,"no man doth station himself in your presence; your dread and your fear doth Jehovah your God put on the face of all the land on which ye tread, as He hath spoken to you."
5011026,5,11,26,"`See, I am setting before you to-day a blessing and a reviling:"
5011027,5,11,27,"the blessing, when ye hearken unto the commands of Jehovah your God, which I am commanding you to-day;"
5011028,5,11,28,"and the reviling, if ye do not hearken unto the commands of Jehovah your God, and have turned aside out of the way which I am commanding you to-day, to go after other gods which ye have not known."
5011029,5,11,29,"`And it hath been, when Jehovah thy God doth bring thee in unto the land whither thou art going in to possess it, that thou hast given the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the reviling on mount Ebal;"
5011030,5,11,30,"are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going in of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who is dwelling in the plain over-against Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?"
5011031,5,11,31,"for ye are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you; and ye have possessed it, and dwelt in it,"
5011032,5,11,32,and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you to day.
5012001,5,12,1,"`These `are' the statutes and the judgments which ye observe to do in the land which Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath given to thee to possess it, all the days that ye are living on the ground:"
5012002,5,12,2,"ye do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which ye are dispossessing served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the heights, and under every green tree;"
5012003,5,12,3,"and ye have broken down their altars, and shivered their standing pillars, and their shrines ye burn with fire, and graven images of their gods ye cut down, and have destroyed their name out of that place."
5012004,5,12,4,`Ye do not do so to Jehovah your God;
5012005,5,12,5,"but unto the place which Jehovah your God doth choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, to His tabernacle ye seek, and thou hast entered thither,"
5012006,5,12,6,"and hast brought in thither your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock;"
5012007,5,12,7,"and ye have eaten there before Jehovah your God, and have rejoiced in every putting forth of your hand, ye and your households, with which Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee."
5012008,5,12,8,"`Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day, each anything that is right in his own eyes,"
5012009,5,12,9,"for ye have not come in hitherto unto the rest, and unto the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee;"
5012010,5,12,10,"and ye have passed over the Jordan, and have dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is causing you to inherit, and He hath given rest to you from all your enemies round about, and ye have dwelt confidently:"
5012011,5,12,11,"`And it hath been, the place on which Jehovah your God doth fix to cause His name to tabernacle there, thither ye bring in all that which I am commanding you, your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all the choice of your vows which ye vow to Jehovah;"
5012012,5,12,12,"and ye have rejoiced before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your handmaids, and the Levite who `is' within your gates, for he hath no part and inheritance with you."
5012013,5,12,13,"`Take heed to thee, lest thou cause thy burnt-offerings to ascend in any place which thou seest,"
5012014,5,12,14,"except in the place which Jehovah doth choose in one of thy tribes, there thou dost cause thy burnt-offerings to ascend, and there thou dost do all that which I am commanding thee."
5012015,5,12,15,"`Only, with all the desire of thy soul thou dost sacrifice, and hast eaten flesh according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which He hath given to thee, in all thy gates; the unclean and the clean do eat it, as of the roe, and as of the hart."
5012016,5,12,16,"`Only, the blood ye do not eat -- on the earth thou dost pour it as water;"
5012017,5,12,17,"thou art not able to eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, and of thy new wine, and thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock, and any of thy vows which thou vowest, and thy free-will offerings, and heave-offering of thy hand;"
5012018,5,12,18,"but before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it, in the place which Jehovah thy God doth fix on, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and the Levite who `is' within thy gates, and thou hast rejoiced before Jehovah thy God in every putting forth of thy hand;"
5012019,5,12,19,take heed to thee lest thou forsake the Levite all thy days on thy ground.
5012020,5,12,20,"`When Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border, as He hath spoken to thee, and thou hast said, Let me eat flesh -- for thy soul desireth to eat flesh -- of all the desire of thy soul thou dost eat flesh."
5012021,5,12,21,"`When the place is far from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there, then thou hast sacrificed of thy herd and of thy flock which Jehovah hath given to thee, as I have commanded thee, and hast eaten within thy gates, of all the desire of thy soul;"
5012022,5,12,22,"only, as the roe and the hart is eaten, so dost thou eat it; the unclean and the clean doth alike eat it."

5012024,5,12,24,"thou dost not eat it, on the earth thou dost pour it as water;"
5012025,5,12,25,"thou dost not eat it, in order that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, when thou dost that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah."

5012027,5,12,27,"and thou hast made thy burnt-offerings -- the flesh and the blood -- on the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices is poured out by the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh thou dost eat."
5012028,5,12,28,"Observe, and thou hast obeyed all these words which I am commanding thee, in order that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee -- to the age, when thou dost that which `is' good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God."

5012031,5,12,31,"`Thou dost not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every abomination of Jehovah which He is hating they have done to their gods, for even their sons and their daughters they burn with fire to their gods."
5012032,5,12,32,"The whole thing which I am commanding you -- it ye observe to do; thou dost not add unto it, nor diminish from it."

5013002,5,13,2,"and the sign and the wonder hath come which he hath spoken of unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods (which thou hast not known), and serve them,"
5013003,5,13,3,"thou dost not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of the dream, for Jehovah your God is trying you, to know whether ye are loving Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your soul;"
5013004,5,13,4,"after Jehovah your God ye walk, and Him ye fear, and His commands ye keep, and to His voice ye hearken, and Him ye serve, and to Him ye cleave."
5013005,5,13,5,"`And that prophet, or that dreamer of the dream, is put to death, for he hath spoken apostacy against Jehovah your God (who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, and hath ransomed you out of a house of servants), to drive you out of the way in which Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee to walk, and thou hast put away the evil thing from thy midst."
5013006,5,13,6,"`When thy brother -- son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who `is' as thine own soul -- doth move thee, in secret, saying, Let us go and serve other gods -- (which thou hast not known, thou and thy fathers,"
5013007,5,13,7,"of the gods of the peoples who `are' round about you, who are near unto thee, or who are far off from thee, from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth) --"

5013013,5,13,13,"Men, sons of worthlessness, have gone out of thy midst, and they force away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known --"
5013014,5,13,14,"and thou hast enquired, and searched, and asked diligently, and lo, truth; the thing is established; this abomination hath been done in thy midst:"
5013015,5,13,15,"`Thou dost surely smite the inhabitants of that city by the mouth of the sword; devoting it, and all that `is' in it, even its cattle, by the mouth of the sword;"
5013016,5,13,16,"and all its spoil thou dost gather unto the midst of its broad place, and hast burned with fire the city and all its spoil completely, before Jehovah thy God, and it hath been a heap age-during, it is not built any more;"
5013017,5,13,17,"and there doth not cleave to thy hand any of the devoted thing, so that Jehovah doth turn back from the fierceness of His anger, and hath given to thee mercies, and loved thee, and multiplied thee, as He hath sworn to thy fathers,"
5013018,5,13,18,"when thou dost hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commands which I am commanding thee to-day, to do that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God."
5014001,5,14,1,"`Sons ye `are' to Jehovah your God; ye do not cut yourselves, nor make baldness between your eyes for the dead;"

5014006,5,14,6,"and every beast dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft into two hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts -- it ye do eat."
5014007,5,14,7,"`Only, this ye do not eat, of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the cloven hoof: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit, for they are bringing up the cud but the hoof have not divided; unclean they `are' to you;"
5014008,5,14,8,"and the sow, for it is dividing the hoof, and not `bringing' up the cud, unclean it `is' to you; of their flesh ye do not eat, and against their carcase ye do not come."
5014009,5,14,9,`This ye do eat of all that `are' in the waters; all that hath fins and scales ye do eat;
5014010,5,14,10,and anything which hath not fins and scales ye do not eat; unclean it `is' to you.
5014011,5,14,11,`Any clean bird ye do eat;

5014014,5,14,14,and every raven after its kind;
5014015,5,14,15,"and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind;"

5014017,5,14,17,"and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant,"
5014018,5,14,18,"and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat;"
5014019,5,14,19,"and every teeming thing which is flying, unclean it `is' to you; they are not eaten;"
5014020,5,14,20,any clean fowl ye do eat.
5014021,5,14,21,"`Ye do not eat of any carcase; to the sojourner who `is' within thy gates thou dost give it, and he hath eaten it; or sell `it' to a stranger; for a holy people thou `art' to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
5014022,5,14,22,`Thou dost certainly tithe all the increase of thy seed which the field is bringing forth year by year;
5014023,5,14,23,"and thou hast eaten before Jehovah thy God, in the place where He doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle, the tithe of thy corn, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd, and of thy flock, so that thou dost learn to fear Jehovah thy God all the days."
5014024,5,14,24,"`And when the way is too much for thee, that thou art not able to carry it -- when the place is too far off from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there, when Jehovah thy God doth bless thee; --"
5014025,5,14,25,"then thou hast given `it' in money, and hast bound up the money in thy hand, and gone unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix;"
5014026,5,14,26,"and thou hast given the money for any thing which thy soul desireth, for oxen, and for sheep, and for wine, and for strong drink, and for any thing which thy soul asketh, and thou hast eaten there before Jehovah thy God, and thou hast rejoiced, thou and thy house."
5014027,5,14,27,"As to the Levite who `is' within thy gates, thou dost not forsake him, for he hath no portion and inheritance with thee."
5014028,5,14,28,"`At the end of three years thou dost bring out all the tithe of thine increase in that year, and hast placed `it' within thy gates;"
5014029,5,14,29,"and come in hath the Levite (for he hath no part and inheritance with thee), and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who `are' within thy gates, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, so that Jehovah thy God doth bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou dost."
5015001,5,15,1,"`At the end of seven years thou dost make a release,"
5015002,5,15,2,"and this `is' the matter of the release: Every owner of a loan `is' to release his hand which he doth lift up against his neighbour, he doth not exact of his neighbour and of his brother, but hath proclaimed a release to Jehovah;"
5015003,5,15,3,"of the stranger thou mayest exact, and that which is thine with thy brother doth thy hand release;"
5015004,5,15,4,"only when there is no needy one with thee, for Jehovah doth greatly bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- an inheritance to possess it."
5015005,5,15,5,"`Only, if thou dost diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this command which I am commanding thee to-day,"
5015006,5,15,6,"for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee as He hath spoken to thee; and thou hast lent `to' many nations, and thou hast not borrowed; and thou hast ruled over many nations, and over thee they do not rule."
5015007,5,15,7,"`When there is with thee any needy one of one of thy brethren, in one of thy cities, in thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, thou dost not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother;"
5015008,5,15,8,"for thou dost certainly open thy hand to him, and dost certainly lend him sufficient for his lack which he lacketh."
5015009,5,15,9,"`Take heed to thee lest there be a word in thy heart -- worthless, saying, Near `is' the seventh year, the year of release; and thine eye is evil against thy needy brother, and thou dost not give to him, and he hath called concerning thee unto Jehovah, and it hath been in thee sin;"
5015010,5,15,10,"thou dost certainly give to him, and thy heart is not sad in thy giving to him, for because of this thing doth Jehovah thy God bless thee in all thy works, and in every putting forth of thy hand;"

5015014,5,15,14,"thou dost certainly encircle him out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy wine-vat; `of' that which Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou dost give to him,"
5015015,5,15,15,"and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God doth ransom thee; therefore I am commanding thee this thing to-day."
5015016,5,15,16,"`And it hath been, when he saith unto thee, I go not out from thee -- because he hath loved thee, and thy house, because `it is' good for him with thee --"
5015017,5,15,17,"then thou hast taken the awl, and hast put `it' through his ear, and through the door, and he hath been to thee a servant age-during; and also to thy handmaid thou dost do so."
5015018,5,15,18,"`It is not hard in thine eyes, in thy sending him away free from thee; for the double of the hire of an hireling he hath served thee six years, and Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all that thou dost."
5015019,5,15,19,"`Every firstling that is born in thy herd and in thy flock -- the male thou dost sanctify to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock;"
5015020,5,15,20,"before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it year by year, in the place which Jehovah doth choose, thou and thy house."

5015023,5,15,23,"Only, its blood thou dost not eat; on the earth thou dost pour it as water."
5016001,5,16,1,"`Observe the month of Abib -- and thou hast made a passover to Jehovah thy God, for in the month of Abib hath Jehovah thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night;"
5016002,5,16,2,"and thou hast sacrificed a passover to Jehovah thy God, of the flock, and of the herd, in the place which Jehovah doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle there."
5016003,5,16,3,"`Thou dost not eat with it any fermented thing, seven days thou dost eat with it unleavened things, bread of affliction; for in haste thou hast come out of the land of Egypt; so that thou dost remember the day of thy coming out of the land of Egypt all days of thy life;"
5016004,5,16,4,"and there is not seen with thee leaven in all thy border seven days, and there doth not remain of the flesh which thou dost sacrifice at evening on the first day till morning."
5016005,5,16,5,"`Thou art not able to sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee,"
5016006,5,16,6,"except at the place which Jehovah thy God doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle -- there thou dost sacrifice the passover in the evening, at the going in of the sun, the season of thy coming out of Egypt;"
5016007,5,16,7,"and thou hast cooked and eaten in the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix, and hast turned in the morning, and gone to thy tents;"
5016008,5,16,8,"six days thou dost eat unleavened things, and on the seventh day `is' a restraint to Jehovah thy God; thou dost do no work."
5016009,5,16,9,"`Seven weeks thou dost number to thee; from the beginning of the sickle among the standing corn thou dost begin to number seven weeks,"
5016010,5,16,10,"and thou hast made the feast of weeks to Jehovah thy God, a tribute of a free-will offering of thy hand, which thou dost give, as Jehovah thy God doth bless thee."
5016011,5,16,11,"And thou hast rejoiced before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and the Levite who `is' within thy gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who `are' in thy midst, in the place which Jehovah thy God doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle there,"
5016012,5,16,12,"and thou hast remembered that a servant thou hast been in Egypt, and hast observed and done these statutes."
5016013,5,16,13,"`The feast of booths thou dost make for thee seven days, in thine in-gathering of thy threshing-floor, and of thy wine-vat;"
5016014,5,16,14,"and thou hast rejoiced in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who `are' within thy gates."
5016015,5,16,15,"Seven days thou dost feast before Jehovah thy God, in the place which Jehovah doth choose, for Jehovah thy God doth bless thee in all thine increase, and in every work of thy hands, and thou hast been only rejoicing."
5016016,5,16,16,"`Three times in a year doth every one of thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which He doth choose -- in the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths; and they do not appear before Jehovah empty;"
5016017,5,16,17,"each according to the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God, which He hath given to thee."
5016018,5,16,18,"`Judges and authorities thou dost make to thee within all thy gates which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, for thy tribes; and they have judged the people -- a righteous judgment."
5016019,5,16,19,"Thou dost not turn aside judgment; thou dost not discern faces, nor take a bribe, for the bribe blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous."
5016020,5,16,20,"Righteousness -- righteousness thou dost pursue, so that thou livest, and hast possessed the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee."
5016021,5,16,21,"`Thou dost not plant for thee a shrine of any trees near the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou makest for thyself,"

5017007,5,17,7,"the hand of the witnesses is on him, in the first place, to put him to death, and the hand of all the people last; and thou hast put away the evil thing out of thy midst."
5017008,5,17,8,"`When anything is too hard for thee for judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke -- matters of strife within thy gates -- then thou hast risen, and gone up unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix,"
5017009,5,17,9,"and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they have declared to thee the word of judgment,"
5017010,5,17,10,and thou hast done according to the tenor of the word which they declare to thee (`they' of that place which Jehovah doth choose; and thou hast observed to do according to all that they direct thee.
5017011,5,17,11,"`According to the tenor of the law which they direct thee, and according to the judgment which they say to thee thou dost do; thou dost not turn aside from the word which they declare to thee, right or left."
5017012,5,17,12,"And the man who acteth with presumption, so as not to hearken unto the priest (who is standing to serve there Jehovah thy God), or unto the judge, even that man hath died, and thou hast put away the evil thing from Israel,"
5017013,5,17,13,"and all the people do hear and fear, and do not presume any more."
5017014,5,17,14,"`When thou comest in unto the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, and hast possessed it, and dwelt in it, and thou hast said, Let me set over me a king like all the nations which `are' round about me, --"
5017015,5,17,15,"thou dost certainly set over thee a king on whom Jehovah doth fix; from the midst of thy brethren thou dost set over thee a king; thou art not able to set over thee a stranger, who is not thy brother."
5017016,5,17,16,"`Only, he doth not multiply to himself horses, nor cause the people to turn back to Egypt, so as to multiply horses, seeing Jehovah hath said to you, Ye do not add to turn back in this way any more."
5017017,5,17,17,"And he doth not multiply to himself wives, and his heart doth not turn aside, and silver and gold he doth not multiply to himself -- exceedingly."
5017018,5,17,18,"`And it hath been, when he sitteth on the throne of his kingdom, that he hath written for himself the copy of this law, on a book, from `that' before the priests the Levites,"
5017019,5,17,19,"and it hath been with him, and he hath read in it all days of his life, so that he doth learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them;"
5017020,5,17,20,"so that his heart is not high above his brethren, and so as not to turn aside from the command, right or left, so that he prolongeth days over his kingdom, he and his sons, in the midst of Israel."
5018001,5,18,1,"`There is not to the priests the Levites -- all the tribe of Levi -- a portion and inheritance with Israel; fire-offerings of Jehovah, even His inheritance, they eat,"
5018002,5,18,2,"and he hath no inheritance in the midst of his brethren; Jehovah Himself `is' his inheritance, as He hath spoken to him."
5018003,5,18,3,"`And this is the priest's right from the people, from those sacrificing a sacrifice, whether ox or sheep, he hath even given to the priest the leg, and the two cheeks, and the stomach;"

5018009,5,18,9,"`When thou art coming in unto the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee, thou dost not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations:"
5018010,5,18,10,"there is not found in thee one causing his son and his daughter to pass over into fire, a user of divinations, an observer of clouds, and an enchanter, and a sorcerer,"
5018011,5,18,11,"and a charmer, and one asking at a familiar spirit, and a wizard, and one seeking unto the dead."
5018012,5,18,12,"`For the abomination of Jehovah `is' every one doing these, and because of these abominations is Jehovah thy God dispossessing them from thy presence."

5018016,5,18,16,"according to all that thou didst ask from Jehovah thy God, in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not add to hear the voice of Jehovah my God, and this great fire let me not see any more, and I die not;"
5018017,5,18,17,"and Jehovah saith unto me, They have done well that they have spoken;"
5018018,5,18,18,"a prophet I raise up to them, out of the midst of their brethren, like to thee; and I have given my words in his mouth, and he hath spoken unto them all that which I command him;"

5025002,5,25,2,"then it hath come to pass, if the wrong-doer is to be smitten, that the judge hath caused him to fall down, and `one' hath smitten him in his presence, according to the sufficiency of his wrong-doing, by number;"
5025003,5,25,3,"forty `times' he doth smite him -- he is not adding, lest, he is adding to smite him above these -- many stripes, and thy brother is lightly esteemed in thine eyes."

5025006,5,25,6,"and it hath been, the first-born which she beareth doth rise for the name of his dead brother, and his name is not wiped away out of Israel."
5025007,5,25,7,"`And if the man doth not delight to take his brother's wife, then hath his brother's wife gone up to the gate, unto the elders, and said, My husband's brother is refusing to raise up to his brother a name in Israel; he hath not been willing to perform the duty of my husband's brother;"
5025008,5,25,8,"and the elders of his city have called for him, and spoken unto him, and he hath stood and said, I have no desire to take her;"
5025009,5,25,9,"`Then hath his brother's wife drawn nigh unto him, before the eyes of the elders, and drawn his shoe from off his foot, and spat in his face, and answered and said, Thus it is done to the man who doth not build up the house of his brother;"

5026011,5,26,11,"and rejoiced in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner who `is' in thy midst."
5026012,5,26,12,"`When thou dost complete to tithe all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, the year of the tithe, then thou hast given to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, and they have eaten within thy gates, and been satisfied,"
5026013,5,26,13,"and thou hast said before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the separated thing out of the house, and also have given it to the Levite, and to the sojourner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, according to all Thy command which Thou hast commanded me; I have not passed over from Thy commands, nor have I forgotten."
5026014,5,26,14,"I have not eaten in mine affliction of it, nor have I put away of it for uncleanness, nor have I given of it for the dead; I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me;"

5027003,5,27,3,"and written on them all the words of this law in thy passing over, so that thou goest in unto the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee -- a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath spoken to thee."

5029017,5,29,17,"and ye see their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which `are' with them,"
5029018,5,29,18,"lest there be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart is turning to-day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations, lest there be in you a root fruitful of gall and wormwood:"
5029019,5,29,19,"`And it hath been, in his hearing the words of this oath, and he hath blessed himself in his heart, saying, I have peace, though in the stubbornness of my heart I go on, in order to end the fulness with the thirst."
5029020,5,29,20,"Jehovah is not willing to be propitious to him, for then doth the anger of Jehovah smoke, also His zeal, against that man, and lain down on him hath all the oath which is written in this book, and Jehovah hath blotted out his name from under the heavens,"
5029021,5,29,21,"and Jehovah hath separated him for evil, out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the oaths of the covenant which is written in this book of the law."
5029022,5,29,22,"`And the latter generation of your sons who rise after you, and the stranger who cometh in from a land afar off, have said when they have seen the strokes of that land, and its sicknesses which Jehovah hath sent into it, --"
5029023,5,29,23,"(`with' brimstone and salt is the whole land burnt, it is not sown, nor doth it shoot up, nor doth there go up on it any herb, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which Jehovah overturned in His anger, and in His fury,) --"
5029024,5,29,24,"yea, all the nations have said, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?"
5029025,5,29,25,"`And they have said, Because that they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah, God of their fathers, which He made with them in His bringing them out of the land of Egypt,"
5029026,5,29,26,"and they go and serve other gods, and bow themselves to them -- gods which they have not known, and which He hath not apportioned to them;"
5029027,5,29,27,"and the anger of Jehovah burneth against that land, to bring in on it all the reviling that is written in this book,"
5029028,5,29,28,"and Jehovah doth pluck them from off their ground in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath, and doth cast them unto another land, as `at' this day."
5029029,5,29,29,"`The things hidden `are' to Jehovah our God, and the things revealed `are' to us and to our sons -- to the age, to do all the words of this law."
5030001,5,30,1,"`And it hath been, when all these things come upon thee, the blessing and the reviling, which I have set before thee, and thou hast brought `them' back unto thy heart, among all the nations whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee away,"
5030002,5,30,2,"and hast turned back unto Jehovah thy God, and hearkened to His voice, according to all that I am commanding thee to-day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul --"
5030003,5,30,3,"then hath Jehovah thy God turned back `to' thy captivity, and pitied thee, yea, He hath turned back and gathered thee out of all the peoples whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee."
5030004,5,30,4,"`If thine outcast is in the extremity of the heavens, thence doth Jehovah thy God gather thee, and thence He doth take thee;"
5030005,5,30,5,"and Jehovah thy God hath brought thee in unto the land which thy fathers have possessed, and thou hast inherited it, and He hath done thee good, and multiplied thee above thy fathers."
5030006,5,30,6,"`And Jehovah thy God hath circumcised thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, for the sake of thy life;"
5030007,5,30,7,"and Jehovah thy God hath put all this oath on thine enemies, and on those hating thee, who have pursued thee."
5030008,5,30,8,"`And thou dost turn back, and hast hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and hast done all His commands which I am commanding thee to-day;"
5030009,5,30,9,"and Jehovah thy God hath made thee abundant in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good; for Jehovah turneth back to rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers,"
5030010,5,30,10,"for thou dost hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep His commands, and His statutes, which are written in the book of this law, for thou turnest back unto Jehovah thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul."
5030011,5,30,11,"`For this command which I am commanding thee to-day, it is not too wonderful for thee, nor `is' it far off."
5030012,5,30,12,"It is not in the heavens, -- saying, Who doth go up for us into the heavens, and doth take it for us, and doth cause us to hear it -- that we may do it."
5030013,5,30,13,"And it `is' not beyond the sea, -- saying, Who doth pass over for us beyond the sea, and doth take it for us, and doth cause us to hear it -- that we may do it?"
5030014,5,30,14,"For very near unto thee is the word, in thy mouth, and in thy heart -- to do it."
5030015,5,30,15,"`See, I have set before thee to-day life and good, and death and evil,"
5030016,5,30,16,"in that I am commanding thee to-day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments; and thou hast lived and multiplied, and Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in the land whither thou art going in to possess it."
5030017,5,30,17,"`And if thy heart doth turn, and thou dost not hearken, and hast been driven away, and hast bowed thyself to other gods, and served them,"
5030018,5,30,18,"I have declared to you this day, that ye do certainly perish, ye do not prolong days on the ground which thou art passing over the Jordan to go in thither to possess it."
5030019,5,30,19,"`I have caused to testify against you to-day the heavens and the earth; life and death I have set before thee, the blessing and the reviling; and thou hast fixed on life, so that thou dost live, thou and thy seed,"
5030020,5,30,20,"to love Jehovah thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him (for He `is' thy life, and the length of thy days), to dwell on the ground which Jehovah hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them.'"
5031001,5,31,1,"And Moses goeth and speaketh these words unto all Israel,"
5031002,5,31,2,"and he saith unto them, `A son of a hundred and twenty years `am' I to-day; I am not able any more to go out and to come in, and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou dost not pass over this Jordan,"
5031003,5,31,3,"`Jehovah thy God He is passing over before thee, He doth destroy these nations from before thee, and thou hast possessed them; Joshua -- he is passing over before thee as Jehovah hath spoken,"
5031004,5,31,4,"and Jehovah hath done to them as he hath done to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorite, and to their land, whom He destroyed."
5031005,5,31,5,"And Jehovah hath given them before your face, and ye have done to them according to all the command which I have commanded you;"
5031006,5,31,6,"be strong and courageous, fear not, nor be terrified because of them, for Jehovah thy God `is' He who is going with thee; He doth not fail thee nor forsake thee.'"
5031007,5,31,7,"And Moses calleth for Joshua, and saith unto him before the eyes of all Israel, `Be strong and courageous, for thou -- thou dost go in with this people unto the land which Jehovah hath sworn to their fathers to give to them, and thou -- thou dost cause them to inherit it;"
5031008,5,31,8,"and Jehovah `is' He who is going before thee, He himself is with thee; He doth not fail thee nor forsake thee; fear not, nor be affrighted.'"
5031009,5,31,9,"And Moses writeth this law, and giveth it unto the priests (sons of Levi, those bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah), and unto all the elders of Israel,"
5031010,5,31,10,"and Moses commandeth them, saying, `At the end of seven years, in the appointed time, the year of release, in the feast of booths,"
5031011,5,31,11,"in the coming in of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah in the place which He chooseth, thou dost proclaim this law before all Israel, in their ears."
5031012,5,31,12,"`Assemble the people, the men, and the women, and the infants, and thy sojourner who `is' within thy gates, so that they hear, and so that they learn, and have feared Jehovah your God, and observed to do all the words of this law;"
5031013,5,31,13,"and their sons, who have not known, do hear, and have learned to fear Jehovah your God all the days which ye are living on the ground whither ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'"
5031014,5,31,14,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thy days have drawn near to die; call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of meeting, and I charge him;' and Moses goeth -- Joshua also -- and they station themselves in the tent of meeting,"
5031015,5,31,15,"and Jehovah is seen in the tent, in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud standeth at the opening of the tent."
5031016,5,31,16,"And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thou art lying down with thy fathers, and this people hath risen, and gone a-whoring after the gods of the stranger of the land into the midst of which it hath entered, and forsaken Me, and broken My covenant which I made with it;"
5031017,5,31,17,"and Mine anger hath burned against it in that day, and I have forsaken them, and hidden My face from them, and it hath been for consumption, and many evils and distresses have found it, and it hath said in that day, Is it not because that my God is not in my midst -- these evils have found me?"
5031018,5,31,18,"and I certainly hide My face in that day for all the evil which it hath done, for it hath turned unto other gods."
5031019,5,31,19,"`And now, write for you this song, and teach it the sons of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song is to Me for a witness against the sons of Israel,"
5031020,5,31,20,"and I bring them in unto the ground which I have sworn to their fathers -- flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, and been fat, and have turned unto other gods, and they have served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant."
5031021,5,31,21,"`And it hath been, when many evils and distresses do meet it, that this song hath testified to its face for a witness; for it is not forgotten out of the mouth of its seed, for I have known its imagining which it is doing to-day, before I bring them in unto the land of which I have sworn.'"
5031022,5,31,22,"And Moses writeth this song on that day, and doth teach it the sons of Israel,"
5031023,5,31,23,"and He commandeth Joshua son of Nun, and saith, `Be strong and courageous, for thou dost bring in the sons of Israel unto the land which I have sworn to them, and I -- I am with thee.'"
5031024,5,31,24,"And it cometh to pass, when Moses finisheth to write the words of this law on a book till their completion,"
5031025,5,31,25,"that Moses commandeth the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,"
5031026,5,31,26,"`Take this Book of the Law, and thou hast set it on the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it hath been there against thee for a witness;"
5031027,5,31,27,"for I -- I have known thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck; lo, in my being yet alive with you to-day, rebellious ye have been with Jehovah, and also surely after my death."
5031028,5,31,28,"`Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your authorities, and I speak in their ears these words, and cause to testify against them the heavens and the earth,"
5031029,5,31,29,"for I have known that after my death ye do very corruptly, and have turned aside out of the way which I commanded you, and evil hath met you in the latter end of the days, because ye do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry with the work of your hands.'"
5031030,5,31,30,"And Moses speaketh in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, till their completion: --"
5032001,5,32,1,"`Give ear, O heavens, and I speak; And thou dost hear, O earth, sayings of my mouth!"
5032002,5,32,2,"Drop as rain doth My doctrine; Flow as dew doth My sayings; As storms on the tender grass, And as showers on the herb,"
5032003,5,32,3,"For the Name of Jehovah I proclaim, Ascribe ye greatness to our God!"
5032004,5,32,4,"The Rock! -- perfect `is' His work, For all His ways `are' just; God of stedfastness, and without iniquity: Righteous and upright `is' He."
5032005,5,32,5,"It hath done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His sons', A generation perverse and crooked!"
5032006,5,32,6,"To Jehovah do ye act thus, O people foolish and not wise? Is not He thy father -- thy possessor? He made thee, and doth establish thee."
5032007,5,32,7,"Remember days of old -- Understand the years of many generations -- Ask thy father, and he doth tell thee; Thine elders, and they say to thee:"
5032008,5,32,8,"In the Most High causing nations to inherit, In His separating sons of Adam -- He setteth up the borders of the peoples By the number of the sons of Israel."
5032009,5,32,9,"For Jehovah's portion `is' His people, Jacob `is' the line of His inheritance."
5032010,5,32,10,"He findeth him in a land -- a desert, And in a void -- a howling wilderness, He turneth him round -- He causeth him to understand -- He keepeth him as the apple of His eye."
5032011,5,32,11,"As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings -- taketh them, Beareth them on its pinions; --"
5032012,5,32,12,"Jehovah alone doth lead him, And there is no strange god with him."
5032013,5,32,13,"He maketh him ride on high places of earth, And he eateth increase of the fields, And He maketh him suck honey from a rock, And oil out of the flint of a rock;"
5032014,5,32,14,"Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, and rams, sons of Bashan, And he-goats, with fat of kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou dost drink wine!"
5032015,5,32,15,"And Jeshurun waxeth fat, and doth kick: Thou hast been fat -- thou hast been thick, Thou hast been covered. And he leaveth God who made him, And dishonoureth the Rock of his salvation."
5032016,5,32,16,"They make Him zealous with strangers, With abominations they make Him angry."
5032017,5,32,17,They sacrifice to demons -- no god! Gods they have not known -- New ones -- from the vicinity they came; Not feared them have your fathers!
5032018,5,32,18,"The Rock that begat thee thou forgettest, And neglectest God who formeth thee."
5032019,5,32,19,And Jehovah seeth and despiseth -- For the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
5032020,5,32,20,"And He saith: I hide My face from them, I see what `is' their latter end; For a froward generation `are' they, Sons in whom is no stedfastness."
5032021,5,32,21,"They have made Me zealous by `no-god,' They made Me angry by their vanities; And I make them zealous by `no-people,' By a foolish nation I make them angry."
5032022,5,32,22,"For a fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, And it burneth unto Sheol -- the lowest, And consumeth earth and its increase, And setteth on fire foundations of mountains."
5032023,5,32,23,"I gather upon them evils, Mine arrows I consume upon them."
5032024,5,32,24,"Exhausted by famine, And consumed by heat, and bitter destruction. And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With poison of fearful things of the dust."
5032025,5,32,25,"Without bereave doth the sword, And at the inner-chambers -- fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair."
5032026,5,32,26,"I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance to cease from man;"
5032027,5,32,27,"If not -- the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their adversaries know -- Lest they say, Our hand is high, And Jehovah hath not wrought all this."
5032028,5,32,28,"For a nation lost to counsels `are' they, And there is no understanding in them."
5032029,5,32,29,If they were wise -- They deal wisely `with' this; They attend to their latter end:
5032030,5,32,30,"How doth one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to flee! If not -- that their rock hath sold them, And Jehovah hath shut them up?"
5032031,5,32,31,"For not as our Rock `is' their rock, (And our enemies `are' judges!)"
5032032,5,32,32,"For of the vine of Sodom their vine `is', And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes `are' grapes of gall -- They have bitter clusters;"
5032033,5,32,33,The poison of dragons `is' their wine And the fierce venom of asps.
5032034,5,32,34,Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?
5032035,5,32,35,"Mine `are' vengeance and recompense, At the due time -- doth their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And haste do things prepared for them."
5032036,5,32,36,"For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants doth repent Himself. For He seeth -- the going away of power, And none is restrained and left."
5032037,5,32,37,"And He hath said, Where `are' their gods -- The rock in which they trusted;"
5032038,5,32,38,"Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be for you a hiding-place!"
5032039,5,32,39,"See ye, now, that I -- I `am' He, And there is no god with Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,"
5032040,5,32,40,"For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I live -- to the age!"
5032041,5,32,41,"If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My hand doth lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine adversaries, And to those hating Me -- I repay!"
5032042,5,32,42,"I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive, From the head of the freemen of the enemy."
5032043,5,32,43,"Sing ye nations -- `with' his people, For the blood of His servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His adversaries, And hath pardoned His land -- His people.'"
5032044,5,32,44,"And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;"
5032045,5,32,45,"and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all Israel,"
5032046,5,32,46,"and saith unto them, `Set your heart to all the words which I am testifying against you to-day, that ye command your sons to observe to do all the words of this law,"
5032047,5,32,47,"for it `is' not a vain thing for you, for it `is' your life, and by this thing ye prolong days on the ground whither ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'"
5032048,5,32,48,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in this self-same day, saying,"
5032049,5,32,49,"`Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which `is' in the land of Moab, which `is' on the front of Jericho, and see the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession;"
5032050,5,32,50,"and die in the mount whither thou art going up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath died in the mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:"
5032051,5,32,51,"`Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh, the wilderness of Zin -- because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the sons of Israel;"
5032052,5,32,52,"but over-against thou seest the land, and thither thou dost not go in, unto the land which I am giving to the sons of Israel.'"
5033001,5,33,1,"And this `is' the blessing `with' which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death,"
5033002,5,33,2,"and he saith: -- `Jehovah from Sinai hath come, And hath risen from Seir for them; He hath shone from mount Paran, And hath come `with' myriads of holy ones; At His right hand `are' springs for them."
5033003,5,33,3,"Also He `is' loving the peoples; All His holy ones `are' in thy hand, And they -- they sat down at thy foot, `Each' He lifteth up at thy words."
5033004,5,33,4,"A law hath Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly of Jacob."
5033005,5,33,5,"And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people gathering together, The tribes of Israel!"
5033006,5,33,6,"Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number."
5033007,5,33,7,"And this `is' for Judah; and he saith: -- Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And unto his people do Thou bring him in; His hand hath striven for him, And an help from his adversaries art Thou."
5033008,5,33,8,"And of Levi he said: -- Thy Thummim and thy Urim `are' for thy pious one, Whom Thou hast tried in Massah, Thou dost strive with Him at the waters of Meribah;"
5033009,5,33,9,"Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen him; And his brethren he hath not discerned, And his sons he hath not known; For they have observed Thy saying, And Thy covenant they keep."
5033010,5,33,10,"They teach Thy judgments to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel; They put perfume in Thy nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine altar."
5033011,5,33,11,"Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And the work of his hands Thou acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of those hating him -- that they rise not!"
5033012,5,33,12,"Of Benjamin he said: -- The beloved of Jehovah doth tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day; Yea, between his shoulders He doth tabernacle."
5033013,5,33,13,"And of Joseph he said: -- Blessed of Jehovah `is' his land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the deep crouching beneath,"
5033014,5,33,14,"And by precious things -- fruits of the sun, And by precious things -- cast forth by the moons,"
5033015,5,33,15,"And by chief things -- of the ancient mountains, And by precious things -- of the age-during heights,"
5033016,5,33,16,"And by precious things -- of earth and its fulness, And the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, -- Let it come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is separate from his brethren."
5033017,5,33,17,"His honour `is' a firstling of his ox, And his horns `are' horns of a reem; By them peoples he doth push together To the ends of earth; And they `are' the myriads of Ephraim, And they `are' the thousands of Manasseh."
5033018,5,33,18,"And of Zebulun he said: -- Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy going out, And, O Issachar, in thy tents;"
5033019,5,33,19,"Peoples `to' the mountain they call, There they sacrifice righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck, And hidden things hidden in the sand."
5033020,5,33,20,"And of Gad he said: -- Blessed of the Enlarger `is' Gad, As a lioness he doth tabernacle, And hath torn the arm -- also the crown!"
5033021,5,33,21,"And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he cometh `with' the heads of the people; The righteousness of Jehovah he hath done, And His judgments with Israel."
5033022,5,33,22,And of Dan he said: -- Dan `is' a lion's whelp; he doth leap from Bashan.
5033023,5,33,23,"And of Naphtali he said: -- O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, West and south possess thou."
5033024,5,33,24,"And of Asher he said: -- Blessed with sons `is' Asher, Let him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot."
5033025,5,33,25,"Iron and brass `are' thy shoes, And as thy days -- thy strength."
5033026,5,33,26,"There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens in thy help, And in His excellency the skies."
5033027,5,33,27,"A habitation `is' the eternal God, And beneath `are' arms age-during. And He casteth out from thy presence the enemy, and saith, `Destroy!'"
5033028,5,33,28,And Israel doth tabernacle `in' confidence alone; The eye of Jacob `is' unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew.
5033029,5,33,29,"O thy happiness, O Israel! who is like thee? A people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And He who `is' the sword of thine excellency: And thine enemies are subdued for thee, And thou on their high places dost tread.'"
5034001,5,34,1,"And Moses goeth up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which `is' on the front of Jericho, and Jehovah sheweth him all the land -- Gilead unto Dan,"
5034002,5,34,2,"and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the further sea,"
5034003,5,34,3,"and the south, and the circuit of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, unto Zoar."
5034004,5,34,4,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `This `is' the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed I give it; I have caused thee to see with thine eyes, and thither thou dost not pass over.'"
5034005,5,34,5,"And Moses, servant of the Lord, dieth there, in the land of Moab, according to the command of Jehovah;"
5034006,5,34,6,"and He burieth him in a valley in the land of Moab, over-against Beth-Peor, and no man hath known his burying place unto this day."
5034007,5,34,7,"And Moses `is' a son of a hundred and twenty years when he dieth; his eye hath not become dim, nor hath his moisture fled."
5034008,5,34,8,And the sons of Israel bewail Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping `and' mourning for Moses are completed.
5034009,5,34,9,"And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him, and the sons of Israel hearken unto him, and do as Jehovah commanded Moses."
5034010,5,34,10,"And there hath not arisen a prophet any more in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah hath known face unto face,"
5034011,5,34,11,"in reference to all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,"
5034012,5,34,12,"and in reference to all the strong hand, and to all the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel."
6001001,6,1,1,"And it cometh to pass after the death of Moses, servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, saying,"
6001002,6,1,2,"`Moses my servant is dead, and now, rise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel."
6001003,6,1,3,"`Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth, to you I have given it, as I have spoken unto Moses."
6001004,6,1,4,"From this wilderness and Lebanon, and unto the great river, the river Phrath, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great Sea -- the going in of the sun -- is your border."
6001005,6,1,5,"`No man doth station himself before thee all days of thy life; as I have been with Moses, I am with thee, I do not fail thee, nor forsake thee;"
6001006,6,1,6,"be strong and courageous, for thou -- thou dost cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them."
6001007,6,1,7,"`Only, be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded thee; thou dost not turn aside from it right or left, so that thou dost act wisely in every `place' whither thou goest;"
6001008,6,1,8,"the book of this law doth not depart out of thy mouth, and thou hast meditated in it by day and by night, so that thou dost observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then thou dost cause thy way to prosper, and then thou dost act wisely."
6001009,6,1,9,"`Have not I commanded thee? be strong and courageous; be not terrified nor affrighted, for with thee `is' Jehovah thy God in every `place' whither thou goest.'"
6001010,6,1,10,"And Joshua commandeth the authorities of the people, saying,"
6001011,6,1,11,"`Pass over into the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provision, for within three days ye are passing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you to possess it.'"
6001012,6,1,12,"And to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, hath Joshua spoken, saying,"
6001013,6,1,13,"`Remember the word which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving rest to you, and He hath given to you this land;"
6001014,6,1,14,"your wives, your infants, and your substance, abide in the land which Moses hath given to you beyond the Jordan, and ye -- ye pass over by fifties, before your brethren, all the mighty ones of valour, and have helped them,"
6001015,6,1,15,"till that Jehovah giveth rest to your brethren as to yourselves, and they have possessed, even they, the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them; then ye have turned back to the land of your possession, and have possessed it, which Moses, servant of Jehovah, hath given to you beyond the Jordan, `at' the sun-rising.'"
6001016,6,1,16,"And they answer Joshua, saying, `All that thou hast commanded us we do; and unto every `place' whither thou dost send us, we go;"
6001017,6,1,17,"according to all that we hearkened unto Moses `in', so we hearken unto thee; surely Jehovah thy God is with thee as He hath been with Moses."
6001018,6,1,18,"Any man who doth provoke thy mouth, and doth not hear thy words, in all that thou dost command him, is put to death; only, be strong and courageous.'"
6002001,6,2,1,"And Joshua son of Nun sendeth from Shittim, two men, spies, silently, saying, `Go, see the land -- and Jericho;' and they go and come into the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name `is' Rahab, and they lie down there."
6002002,6,2,2,"And it is told to the king of Jericho, saying, `Lo, men have come in hither to-night, from the sons of Israel, to search the land."
6002003,6,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sendeth unto Rahab, saying, `Bring out the men who are coming in unto thee, who have come into thy house, for to search the whole of the land they have come in."
6002004,6,2,4,"And the woman taketh the two men, and hideth them, and saith thus: `The men came in unto me, and I have not known whence they `are';"
6002005,6,2,5,"and it cometh to pass -- the gate is to `be' shut -- in the dark, and the men have gone out; I have not known whither the men have gone; pursue ye, hasten after them, for ye overtake them;'"
6002006,6,2,6,"and she hath caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof."
6002007,6,2,7,"And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan, by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the pursuers have gone out after them."
6002008,6,2,8,"And -- before they lie down -- she hath gone up unto them on the roof,"
6002009,6,2,9,"and she saith unto the men, `I have known that Jehovah hath given to you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at your presence."
6002010,6,2,10,"`For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea at your presence, in your going out of Egypt, and that which ye have done to the two kings of the Amorite who `are' beyond the Jordan; to Sihon and to Og whom ye devoted."
6002011,6,2,11,"And we hear, and melt doth our heart, and there hath not stood any more spirit in `any' man, from your presence, for Jehovah your God, He `is' God in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath."
6002012,6,2,12,"`And now, swear ye, I pray you, to me by Jehovah -- because I have done with you kindness -- that ye have done, even ye, kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a true token,"
6002013,6,2,13,"and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have delivered our souls from death.'"
6002014,6,2,14,"And the men say to her, `Our soul for yours -- to die; if ye declare not this our matter, then it hath been, in Jehovah's giving to us this land, that we have done with thee kindness and truth.'"
6002015,6,2,15,"And she causeth them to go down by a rope through the window, for her house `is' in the side of the wall, and in the wall she `is' dwelling;"
6002016,6,2,16,"and she saith to them, `To the mountain go, lest the pursuers come upon you; and ye have been hidden there three days till the turning back of the pursuers, and afterwards ye go on your way.'"
6002017,6,2,17,"And the men say unto her, `We are acquitted of this thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear:"
6002018,6,2,18,"lo, we are coming into the land, this line of scarlet thread thou dost bind to the window by which thou hast caused us to go down, and thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the house of thy father thou dost gather unto thee, to the house;"
6002019,6,2,19,"and it hath been, any one who goeth out from the doors of thy house without, his blood `is' on his head, and we are innocent; and any one who is with thee in the house, his blood `is' on our head, if a hand is on him;"
6002020,6,2,20,"and if thou declare this our matter, then we have been acquitted from thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear.'"
6002021,6,2,21,"And she saith, `According unto your words, so it `is';' and she sendeth them away, and they go; and she bindeth the scarlet line to the window."
6002022,6,2,22,"And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found."
6002023,6,2,23,"And the two men turn back, and come down from the hill, and pass over, and come in unto Joshua son of Nun, and recount to him all that hath come upon them;"
6002024,6,2,24,"and they say unto Joshua, `Surely Jehovah hath given into our hand all the land; and also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted at our presence.'"
6003001,6,3,1,"And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and they journey from Shittim, and come in unto the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they lodge there before they pass over."
6003002,6,3,2,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days, that the authorities pass over into the midst of the camp,"
6003003,6,3,3,"and command the people, saying, `When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then ye journey from your place, and have gone after it;"
6003004,6,3,4,"only, a distance is between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; ye do not come near unto it, so that ye know the way in which ye go, for ye have not passed over in the way heretofore.'"
6003005,6,3,5,"And Joshua saith unto the people, `Sanctify yourselves, for to-morrow doth Jehovah do in your midst wonders.'"
6003006,6,3,6,"And Joshua speaketh unto the priests, saying, `Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people;' and they take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people."
6003007,6,3,7,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `This day I begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they know that as I was with Moses I am with thee;"
6003008,6,3,8,"and thou, thou dost command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come unto the extremity of the waters of the Jordan -- in the Jordan ye stand.'"
6003009,6,3,9,"And Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel, `Come nigh hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God;"
6003010,6,3,10,"and Joshua saith, `By this ye know that the living God `is' in your midst, and He doth certainly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite:"
6003011,6,3,11,"lo, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into Jordan;"
6003012,6,3,12,"and now, take for you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man -- one man for a tribe;"
6003013,6,3,13,"and it hath been, at the resting of the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, Lord of all the earth, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan are cut off -- the waters which are coming down from above -- and they stand -- one heap.'"
6003014,6,3,14,"And it cometh to pass, in the journeying of the people from their tents to pass over the Jordan, and of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,"
6003015,6,3,15,"and at those bearing the ark coming in unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark have been dipped in the extremity of the waters (and the Jordan is full over all its banks all the days of harvest) --"
6003016,6,3,16,"that the waters stand; those coming down from above have risen -- one heap, very far above Adam the city, which `is' at the side of Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, have been completely cut off; and the people have passed through over-against Jericho;"
6003017,6,3,17,"and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stand on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan -- established, and all Israel are passing over on dry ground till that all the nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan."
6004001,6,4,1,"And it cometh to pass, when all the nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying,"
6004002,6,4,2,"`Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man -- one man out of a tribe;"
6004003,6,4,3,"and command ye them, saying, Take up for you from this `place', from the midst of the Jordan, from the established standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and ye have removed them over with you, and placed them in the lodging-place in which ye lodge to-night.'"
6004004,6,4,4,"And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out of the sons of Israel, one man -- one man out of a tribe;"
6004005,6,4,5,"and Joshua saith to them, `Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God unto the midst of the Jordan and lift up for you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,"
6004006,6,4,6,"so that this is a sign in your midst, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What `are' these stones to you?"
6004007,6,4,7,"that ye have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a memorial to the sons of Israel -- to the age.'"
6004008,6,4,8,"And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah hath spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the lodging-place, and place them there,"
6004009,6,4,9,"even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the midst of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there unto this day."
6004010,6,4,10,"And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass over."
6004011,6,4,11,"And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to pass over, that the ark of Jehovah passeth over, and the priests, in the presence of the people;"
6004012,6,4,12,"and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them;"
6004013,6,4,13,"about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over before Jehovah for battle, unto the plains of Jericho."
6004014,6,4,14,"On that day hath Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they reverence him, as they reverenced Moses, all days of his life."
6004015,6,4,15,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying,"
6004016,6,4,16,"`Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and they come up out of the Jordan.'"
6004017,6,4,17,"And Joshua commandeth the priests, saying, `Come ye up out of the Jordan.'"
6004018,6,4,18,"And it cometh to pass, in the coming up of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the midst of the Jordan -- the soles of the feet of the priests have been drawn up into the dry ground -- and the waters of the Jordan turn back to their place, and go as heretofore over all its banks."
6004019,6,4,19,"And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east of Jericho;"
6004020,6,4,20,"and these twelve stones, which they have taken out of the Jordan, hath Joshua raised up in Gilgal."
6004021,6,4,21,"And he speaketh unto the sons of Israel, saying, `When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What `are' these stones?"
6004022,6,4,22,"then ye have caused your sons to know, saying, On dry land Israel passed over this Jordan;"
6004023,6,4,23,"because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan at your presence, till your passing over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up at our presence till our passing over;"
6004024,6,4,24,"so that all the people of the land do know the hand of Jehovah that it `is' strong, so that ye have reverenced Jehovah your God all the days.'"
6005001,6,5,1,"And it cometh to pass when all the kings of the Amorite which `are' beyond the Jordan, towards the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanite which `are' by the sea, hear how that Jehovah hath dried up the waters of the Jordan at the presence of the sons of Israel till their passing over, that their heart is melted, and there hath not been in them any more spirit because of the presence of the sons of Israel."
6005002,6,5,2,"At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua, `Make for thee knives of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time;'"
6005003,6,5,3,"and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint, and circumciseth the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins."
6005004,6,5,4,"And this `is' the thing `for' which Joshua circumciseth `them': all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males, all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out of Egypt,"
6005005,6,5,5,"for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and all the people who `are' born in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised;"
6005006,6,5,6,"for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah hath sworn not to show them the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey, are consumed;"
6005007,6,5,7,"and their sons He raised up in their stead, them hath Joshua circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have not circumcised them in the way."
6005008,6,5,8,"And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp till their recovering;"
6005009,6,5,9,"and Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `To-day I have rolled the reproach of Egypt from off you;' and `one' calleth the name of that place Gilgal unto this day."
6005010,6,5,10,"And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho;"
6005011,6,5,11,"and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of the passover, unleavened things and roasted `corn', in this self-same day;"
6005012,6,5,12,"and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of the old corn of the land, and there hath been no more manna to the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of Canaan in that year."
6005013,6,5,13,"And it cometh to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho, that he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, one standing over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua goeth unto him, and saith to him, `Art thou for us or for our adversaries?'"
6005014,6,5,14,"And He saith, `No, for I `am' Prince of Jehovah's host; now I have come;' and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and saith to Him, `What is my Lord speaking unto His servant?'"
6005015,6,5,15,"And the Prince of Jehovah's host saith unto Joshua, `Cast off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou art standing is holy;' and Joshua doth so;"
6006001,6,6,1,"(And Jericho shutteth itself up, and is shut up, because of the presence of the sons of Israel -- none going out, and none coming in;)"
6006002,6,6,2,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king -- mighty ones of valour,"
6006003,6,6,3,and ye have compassed the city -- all the men of battle -- going round the city once; thus thou dost six days;
6006004,6,6,4,"and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark, and on the seventh day ye compass the city seven times, and the priests blow with the trumpets,"
6006005,6,6,5,"and it hath been, in the prolongation of the horn of the jubilee, in your hearing the voice of the trumpet, all the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall of the city hath fallen under it, and the people have gone up, each over-against him.'"
6006006,6,6,6,"And Joshua son of Nun calleth unto the priests, and saith unto them, `Bear ye the ark of the covenant, and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Jehovah;'"
6006007,6,6,7,"and He said unto the people, `Pass over, and compass the city, and he who is armed doth pass over before the ark of Jehovah.'"
6006008,6,6,8,"And it cometh to pass, when Joshua speaketh unto the people, that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before Jehovah have passed over and blown with the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is going after them;"
6006009,6,6,9,"and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the trumpets, and he who is gathering up is going after the ark, going on and blowing with the trumpets;"
6006010,6,6,10,"and the people hath Joshua commanded, saying, `Ye do not shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor doth there go out from your mouth a word, till the day of my saying unto you, Shout ye -- then ye have shouted.'"
6006011,6,6,11,"And the ark of Jehovah doth compass the city, going round once, and they come into the camp, and lodge in the camp."
6006012,6,6,12,"And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and the priests bear the ark of Jehovah,"
6006013,6,6,13,"and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Jehovah are walking, going on, and they have blown with the trumpets -- and he who is armed is going before them, and he who is gathering up is going behind the ark of Jehovah -- going on and blowing with the trumpets."
6006014,6,6,14,"And they compass the city on the second day once, and turn back to the camp; thus they have done six days."
6006015,6,6,15,"And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they rise early, at the ascending of the dawn, and compass the city, according to this manner, seven times; (only, on that day they have compassed the city seven times);"
6006016,6,6,16,"and it cometh to pass, at the seventh time, the priests have blown with the trumpets, and Joshua saith unto the people, `Shout ye, for Jehovah hath given to you the city;"
6006017,6,6,17,"and the city hath been devoted, it and all that `is' in it, to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot doth live, she and all who `are' with her in the house, for she hid the messengers whom we sent;"
6006018,6,6,18,"and surely ye have kept from the devoted thing, lest ye devote `yourselves', and have taken from the devoted thing, and have made the camp of Israel become a devoted thing, and have troubled it;"
6006019,6,6,19,"and all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, holy they `are' to Jehovah; into the treasury of Jehovah they come.'"
6006020,6,6,20,"And the people shout, and blow with the trumpets, and it cometh to pass when the people hear the voice of the trumpet, that the people shout -- a great shout, and the wall falleth under it, and the people goeth up into the city, each over-against him, and they capture the city;"
6006021,6,6,21,"and they devote all that `is' in the city, from man even unto woman, from young even unto aged, even unto ox, and sheep, and ass, by the mouth of the sword."
6006022,6,6,22,"And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said, `Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all whom she hath, as ye have sworn to her.'"
6006023,6,6,23,"And the young man, the spies, go in and bring out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all whom she hath; yea, all her families they have brought out, and place them at the outside of the camp of Israel."
6006024,6,6,24,"And the city they have burnt with fire, and all that `is' in it; only, the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass, and of iron, they have given `to' the treasury of the house of Jehovah;"
6006025,6,6,25,"and Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all whom she hath, hath Joshua kept alive; and she dwelleth in the midst of Israel unto this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
6006026,6,6,26,"And Joshua adjureth `them' at that time, saying, `Cursed `is' the man before Jehovah who raiseth up and hath built this city, `even' Jericho; in his first-born he doth lay its foundation, and in his youngest he doth set up its doors;'"
6006027,6,6,27,"and Jehovah is with Joshua, and his fame is in all the land."
6007001,6,7,1,"And the sons of Israel commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, taketh of the devoted thing, and the anger of Jehovah burneth against the sons of Israel."
6007002,6,7,2,"And Joshua sendeth men from Jericho to Ai, which `is' near Beth-Aven, on the east of Bethel, and speaketh unto them, saying, `Go up and spy the land;' and the men go up and spy Ai,"
6007003,6,7,3,"and they turn back unto Joshua, and say unto him, `Let not all the people go up; let about two thousand men, or about three thousand men, go up, and they smite Ai; cause not all the people to labour thither; for they `are' few.'"
6007004,6,7,4,"And there go up of the people thither about three thousand men, and they flee before the men of Ai,"
6007005,6,7,5,"and the men of Ai smite of them about thirty and six men, and pursue them before the gate unto Shebarim, and they smite them in Morad; and the heart of the people is melted, and becometh water."
6007006,6,7,6,"And Joshua rendeth his garments, and falleth on his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah till the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they cause dust to go up on their head."
6007007,6,7,7,"And Joshua saith, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, why hast Thou at all caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us? -- and oh that we had been willing -- and we dwell beyond the Jordan!"
6007008,6,7,8,"Oh, Lord, what do I say, after that Israel hath turned the neck before its enemies?"
6007009,6,7,9,"and the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land do hear, and have come round against us, and cut off our name out of the earth; and what dost Thou do for Thy great name?'"
6007010,6,7,10,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Rise for thee, why `is' this? -- thou `art' falling on thy face?"
6007011,6,7,11,"Israel hath sinned, and also they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them, and also taken of the devoted thing, and also stolen, and also deceived, and also put `it' among their vessels,"
6007012,6,7,12,"and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; the neck they turn before their enemies, for they have become a devoted thing; I add not to be with you -- if ye destroy not the devoted thing out of your midst."
6007013,6,7,13,"`Rise, sanctify the people, and thou hast said, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, A devoted thing `is' in thy midst, O Israel, thou art not able to stand before thine enemies till your turning aside of the devoted thing out of your midst;"
6007014,6,7,14,"and ye have been brought near in the morning by your tribes, and it hath been, the tribe which Jehovah doth capture doth draw near by families, and the family which Jehovah doth capture doth draw near by households, and the household which Jehovah doth capture doth draw near by men;"
6007015,6,7,15,"and it hath been, he who is captured with the devoted thing is burnt with fire, he and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath done folly in Israel.'"
6007016,6,7,16,"And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and bringeth Israel near by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah is captured;"
6007017,6,7,17,"and he bringeth near the family of Judah, and he captureth the family of the Zarhite; and he bringeth near the family of the Zarhite by men, and Zabdi is captured;"
6007018,6,7,18,"and he bringeth near his household by men, and Achan -- son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah -- is captured."
6007019,6,7,19,"And Joshua saith unto Achan, `My son, put, I pray thee, honour on Jehovah, God of Israel, and give to Him thanks, and declare, I pray thee, to me, what thou hast done -- hide not from me.'"
6007020,6,7,20,"And Achan answereth Joshua, and saith, `Truly I have sinned against Jehovah, God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done;"
6007021,6,7,21,"and I see among the spoil a goodly robe of Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and one wedge of gold, whose weight `is' fifty shekels, and I desire them, and take them; and lo, they `are' hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.'"
6007022,6,7,22,"And Joshua sendeth messengers, and they run unto the tent, and lo, it is hidden in his tent, and the silver under it;"
6007023,6,7,23,"and they take them out of the midst of the tent, and bring them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel, and pour them out before Jehovah."
6007024,6,7,24,"And Joshua taketh Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, and the robe, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his flock, and his tent, and all that he hath, and all Israel with him, and they cause them to go up the valley of Achor."
6007025,6,7,25,"And Joshua saith, `What! thou hast troubled us! -- Jehovah doth trouble thee this day;' and all Israel cast stones at him, and they burn them with fire, and they stone them with stones,"
6007026,6,7,26,"and they raise up over him a great heap of stones unto this day, and Jehovah turneth back from the heat of His anger, therefore hath `one' called the name of that place `Valley of Achor' till this day."
6008001,6,8,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Fear not, nor be affrighted, take with thee all the people of war, and rise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land,"
6008002,6,8,2,"and thou hast done to Ai and to her king as thou hast done to Jericho and to her king; only, its spoil and its cattle ye spoil for yourselves; set for thee an ambush for the city at its rear.'"
6008003,6,8,3,"And Joshua riseth, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai, and Joshua chooseth thirty thousand men, mighty ones of valour, and sendeth them away by night,"
6008004,6,8,4,"and commandeth them, saying, `See, ye are liers in wait against the city, at the rear of the city, ye go not very far off from the city, and all of you have been prepared,"
6008005,6,8,5,"and I and all the people who `are' with me draw near unto the city, and it hath come to pass when they come out to meet us as at the first, and we have fled before them,"
6008006,6,8,6,"and they have come out after us till we have drawn them out of the city, for they say, They are fleeing before us as at the first, and we have fled before them,"
6008007,6,8,7,"and ye rise from the ambush, and have occupied the city, and Jehovah your God hath given it into your hand;"
6008008,6,8,8,"and it hath been, when ye capture the city, ye burn the city with fire, according to the word of Jehovah ye do, see, I have commanded you.'"
6008009,6,8,9,"And Joshua sendeth them away, and they go unto the ambush, and abide between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai; and Joshua lodgeth on that night in the midst of the people."
6008010,6,8,10,"And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and inspecteth the people, and goeth up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai;"
6008011,6,8,11,"and all the people of war who `are' with him have gone up, and draw nigh and come in over-against the city, and encamp on the north of Ai; and the valley `is' between him and Ai."
6008012,6,8,12,"And he taketh about five thousand men, and setteth them an ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city;"
6008013,6,8,13,"and they set the people, all the camp which `is' on the north of the city, and its rear on the west of the city, and Joshua goeth on that night into the midst of the valley."
6008014,6,8,14,"And it cometh to pass, when the king of Ai seeth `it', that hasten, and rise early, and go out do the men of the city to meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at the appointed season, at the front of the plain, and he hath not known that an ambush `is' against him, on the rear of the city."
6008015,6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel `seem' stricken before them, and flee the way of the wilderness,"
6008016,6,8,16,"and all the people who `are' in the city are called to pursue after them, and they pursue after Joshua, and are drawn away out of the city,"
6008017,6,8,17,"and there hath not been left a man in Ai and Bethel who hath not gone out after Israel, and they leave the city open, and pursue after Israel."
6008018,6,8,18,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Stretch out with the javelin which `is' in thy hand towards Ai, for into thy hand I give it;' and Joshua stretcheth out with the javelin which `is' in his hand toward the city,"
6008019,6,8,19,"and the ambush hath risen `with' haste, out of its place, and they run at the stretching out of his hand, and go into the city, and capture it, and hasten, and burn the city with fire."
6008020,6,8,20,"And the men of Ai look behind them, and see, and lo, the smoke of the city hath gone up unto the heavens, and there hath not been in them power to flee hither and thither -- and the people who are fleeing to the wilderness have turned against the pursuer, --"
6008021,6,8,21,"and Joshua and all Israel have seen that the ambush hath captured the city, and that the smoke of the city hath gone up, and they turn back and smite the men of Ai;"
6008022,6,8,22,"and these have come out from the city to meet them, and they are in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that, and they smite them till he hath not left to them a remnant and escaped one;"
6008023,6,8,23,"and the king of Ai they caught alive, and bring him near unto Joshua."
6008024,6,8,24,"And it cometh to pass, at Israel's finishing to slay all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them (and they fall all of them by the mouth of the sword till their consumption), that all Israel turn back to Ai, and smite it by the mouth of the sword;"
6008025,6,8,25,"and all who fall during the day, of men and of women, are twelve thousand -- all men of Ai."
6008026,6,8,26,And Joshua hath not brought back his hand which he stretched out with the javelin till that he hath devoted all the inhabitants of Ai;
6008027,6,8,27,"only, the cattle and the spoil of that city have Israel spoiled for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which He commanded Joshua."
6008028,6,8,28,"And Joshua burneth Ai, and maketh it a heap age-during -- a desolation unto this day;"
6008029,6,8,29,"and the king of Ai he hath hanged on the tree till even-time, and at the going in of the sun hath Joshua commanded, and they take down his carcase from the tree, and cast it unto the opening of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones till this day."
6008030,6,8,30,"Then doth Joshua build an altar to Jehovah, God of Israel, in mount Ebal,"
6008031,6,8,31,"as Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses -- an altar of whole stones, over which he hath not waved iron -- and they cause to go up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and sacrifice peace-offerings;"
6008032,6,8,32,"and he writeth there on the stones the copy of the law of Moses, which he hath written in the presence of the sons of Israel."
6008033,6,8,33,"And all Israel, and its elders, and authorities, and its judges, are standing on this side and on that of the ark, over-against the priests, the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the native, half of them over-against mount Gerizim, and the half of them over-against mount Ebal, as Moses servant of Jehovah commanded to bless the people of Israel at the first."
6008034,6,8,34,"And afterwards he hath proclaimed all the words of the law, the blessing and the reviling, according to all that is written in the book of the law;"
6008035,6,8,35,"there hath not been a thing of all that Moses commanded which Joshua hath not proclaimed before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the infants, and the sojourner who is going in their midst."
6009001,6,9,1,"And it cometh to pass, when all the kings who `are' beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the low-country, and in every haven of the great sea, over-against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, hear --"
6009002,6,9,2,"that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua, and with Israel -- one mouth."
6009003,6,9,3,"And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua hath done to Jericho and to Ai,"
6009004,6,9,4,"and they work, even they, with subtilty, and go, and feign to be ambassadors, and take old sacks for their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,"
6009005,6,9,5,"and sandals, old and patched, on their feet, and old garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision is dry -- it was crumbs."
6009006,6,9,6,"And they go unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, and say unto him, and unto the men of Israel, `From a land far off we have come, and now, make with us a covenant;'"
6009007,6,9,7,"and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite, `It may be in our midst ye are dwelling, and how do we make with thee a covenant?'"
6009008,6,9,8,"and they say unto Joshua, `Thy servants we `are'.' And Joshua saith unto them, `Who `are' ye? and whence come ye?'"
6009009,6,9,9,"And they say unto him, `From a land very far off have thy servants come, for the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard His fame, and all that He hath done in Egypt,"
6009010,6,9,10,"and all that He hath done to the two kings of the Amorite who `are' beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who `is' in Ashtaroth."
6009011,6,9,11,"`And our elders, and all the inhabitants of our land speak unto us, saying, Take in your hand provision for the way, and go to meet them, and ye have said unto them, Your servants we `are', and now, make with us a covenant;"
6009012,6,9,12,"this our bread -- hot we provided ourselves with it out of our houses, on the day of our coming out to go unto you, and now, lo, it is dry, and hath been crumbs;"
6009013,6,9,13,"and these `are' the wine-bottles which we filled, new, and lo, they have rent; and these, our garments and our sandals, have become old, from the exceeding greatness of the way.'"
6009014,6,9,14,"And the men take of their provision, and the mouth of Jehovah have not asked;"
6009015,6,9,15,"and Joshua maketh with them peace, and maketh with them a covenant, to keep them alive; and swear to them do the princes of the company."
6009016,6,9,16,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days after that they have made with them a covenant, that they hear that they `are' their neighbours -- that in their midst they are dwelling."
6009017,6,9,17,"And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their cities on the third day -- and their cities `are' Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-Jearim --"
6009018,6,9,18,"and the sons of Israel have not smitten them, for sworn to them have the princes of the company by Jehovah God of Israel, and all the company murmur against the princes."
6009019,6,9,19,"And all the princes say unto all the company, `We -- we have sworn to them by Jehovah, God of Israel; and now, we are not able to come against them;"
6009020,6,9,20,"this we do to them, and have kept them alive, and wrath is not upon us, because of the oath which we have sworn to them.'"
6009021,6,9,21,"And the princes say unto them, `They live, and are hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the company, as the princes spake to them.'"
6009022,6,9,22,"And Joshua calleth for them, and speaketh unto them, saying, `Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, and ye in our midst dwelling?"
6009023,6,9,23,"and now, cursed are ye, and none of you is cut off `from being' a servant, even hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the house of my God.'"
6009024,6,9,24,"And they answer Joshua and say, `Because it was certainly declared to thy servants, that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses His servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we fear greatly for ourselves because of you, and we do this thing;"
6009025,6,9,25,"and now, lo, we `are' in thy hand, as `it is' good, and as `it is' right in thine eyes to do to us -- do.'"
6009026,6,9,26,"And he doth to them so, and delivereth them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they have not slain them;"
6009027,6,9,27,"and Joshua maketh them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the company, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, at the place which He doth choose."
6010001,6,10,1,"And it cometh to pass, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heareth that Joshua hath captured Ai, and doth devote it (as he had done to Jericho and to her king so he hath done to Ai and to her king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon have made peace with Israel, and are in their midst, --"
6010002,6,10,2,"that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon `is' a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it `is' greater than Ai, and all its men -- heroes."
6010003,6,10,3,"And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6010004,6,10,4,"`Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.'"
6010005,6,10,5,"And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it."
6010006,6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, saying, `Let not thy hand cease from thy servants; come up unto us `with' haste, and give safety to us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country, have been assembled against us.'"
6010007,6,10,7,"And Joshua goeth up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty men of valour."
6010008,6,10,8,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Be not afraid of them, for into thy hand I have given them, there doth not stand a man of them in thy presence.'"
6010009,6,10,9,"And Joshua cometh in unto them suddenly (all the night he hath gone up from Gilgal),"
6010010,6,10,10,"and Jehovah doth crush them before Israel, and it smiteth them -- a great smiting -- at Gibeon, and pursueth them the way of the ascent of Beth-Horon, and smiteth them unto Azekah, and unto Makkedah."
6010011,6,10,11,"And it cometh to pass, in their fleeing from the face of Israel -- they `are' in the descent of Beth-Horon -- and Jehovah hath cast upon them great stones out of the heavens, unto Azekah, and they die; more are they who have died by the hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel have slain by the sword."
6010012,6,10,12,"Then speaketh Joshua to Jehovah in the day of Jehovah's giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he saith, before the eyes of Israel, `Sun -- in Gibeon stand still; and moon -- in the valley of Ajalon;'"
6010013,6,10,13,"and the sun standeth still, and the moon hath stood -- till the nation taketh vengeance `on' its enemies; is it not written on the Book of the Upright, `and the sun standeth in the midst of the heavens, and hath not hasted to go in -- as a perfect day?'"
6010014,6,10,14,"And there hath not been like that day before it or after it, for Jehovah's hearkening to the voice of a man; for Jehovah is fighting for Israel."
6010015,6,10,15,"And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal."
6010016,6,10,16,"And these five kings flee, and are hidden in a cave at Makkedah,"
6010017,6,10,17,"and it is declared to Joshua, saying, `The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.'"
6010018,6,10,18,"And Joshua saith, `Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and appoint over it men to watch them;"
6010019,6,10,19,"and ye, stand not, pursue after your enemies, and ye have smitten the hindmost of them; suffer them not to go in unto their cities, for Jehovah your God hath given them into your hand.'"
6010020,6,10,20,"And it cometh to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel finish to smite them -- a very great smiting, till they are consumed, and the remnant who have remained of them go in unto the fenced cities,"
6010021,6,10,21,"that all the people turn back to the camp, unto Joshua, `at' Makkedah, in peace; none moved sharply his tongue against the sons of Israel."
6010022,6,10,22,"And Joshua saith, `Open ye the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me these five kings from the cave;'"
6010023,6,10,23,"and they do so, and bring out unto him these five kings from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon."
6010024,6,10,24,"And it cometh to pass, when they bring out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua calleth unto every man of Israel, and saith unto the captains of the men of war, who have gone with him, `Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings;' and they draw near, and set their feet on their necks."
6010025,6,10,25,"And Joshua saith unto them, `Fear not, nor be affrighted; be strong and courageous; for thus doth Jehovah do to all your enemies with whom ye are fighting;'"
6010026,6,10,26,"and Joshua smiteth them afterwards, and putteth them to death, and hangeth them on five trees; and they are hanging on the trees till the evening."
6010027,6,10,27,"And it cometh to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, Joshua hath commanded, and they take them down from off the trees, and cast them unto the cave where they had been hid, and put great stones on the mouth of the cave till this very day."
6010028,6,10,28,"And Makkedah hath Joshua captured on that day, and he smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and its king he hath devoted, them and every person who `is' in it -- he hath not left a remnant; and he doth to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho."
6010029,6,10,29,"And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah `to' Libnah, and fighteth with Libnah;"
6010030,6,10,30,"and Jehovah giveth also it into the hand of Israel, and its king, and it smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who `is' in it -- it left not in it a remnant; and it doth to its king as it did to the king of Jericho."
6010031,6,10,31,"And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and encampeth against it, and fighteth against it;"
6010032,6,10,32,"And Jehovah giveth Lachish into the hand of Israel, and it captureth it on the second day, and smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who `is' in it, according to all that it did to Libnah."
6010033,6,10,33,"Than hath Horam king of Gezer come up to help Lachish, and Joshua smiteth him and his people, till he hath not left to him a remnant."
6010034,6,10,34,"And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they encamp against it, and fight against it,"
6010035,6,10,35,"and capture it on that day, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who `is' in it on that day he hath devoted, according to all that he did to Lachish."
6010036,6,10,36,"And Joshua goeth up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fight against it,"
6010037,6,10,37,"and capture it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and every person who `is' in it -- he hath not left a remnant -- according to all that he did to Eglon -- and doth devote it, and every person who `is' in it."
6010038,6,10,38,"And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fighteth against it,"
6010039,6,10,39,"and captureth it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smite them by the mouth of the sword, and devote every person who `is' in it -- he hath not left a remnant; as he did to Hebron so he did to Debir, and to its king, and as he did to Libnah, and to its king."
6010040,6,10,40,"And Joshua smiteth all the land of the hill-country, and of the south, and of the low-country, and of the springs, and all their kings -- he hath not left a remnant, and all that doth breathe he hath devoted, as Jehovah, God of Israel, commanded."
6010041,6,10,41,"And Joshua smiteth them from Kadesh-Barnea, even unto Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even unto Gibeon;"
6010042,6,10,42,"and all these kings and their land hath Joshua captured `at' one time, for Jehovah, God of Israel, is fighting for Israel."
6010043,6,10,43,"and Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal."
6011001,6,11,1,"And it cometh to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heareth, that he sendeth unto Jobab king of Madon, and unto the king of Shimron, and unto the king of Achshaph,"
6011002,6,11,2,"and unto the kings who `are' on the north in the hill-country, and in the plain south of Chinneroth, and in the low country, and in the elevations of Dor, on the west,"
6011003,6,11,3,"`to' the Canaanite on the east, and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon, in the land of Mizpeh --"
6011004,6,11,4,"and they go out, they and all their camps with them, a people numerous, as the sand which `is' on the sea-shore for multitude, and horse and charioteer very many;"
6011005,6,11,5,"and all these kings are met together, and they come and encamp together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel."
6011006,6,11,6,"And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Be not afraid of their presence, for to-morrow about this time I am giving all of them wounded before Israel; their horses thou dost hough, and their chariots burn with fire.'"
6011007,6,11,7,"And Joshua cometh, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fall on them;"
6011008,6,11,8,"and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of Israel, and they smite them and pursue them unto the great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-Maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward, and they smite them, till he hath not left to them a remnant;"
6011009,6,11,9,"and Joshua doth to them as Jehovah said to him; their horses he hath houghed, and their chariots burnt with fire."
6011010,6,11,10,"And Joshua turneth back at that time, and captureth Hazor, and its king he hath smitten by the sword; for Hazor formerly `is' head of all these kingdoms;"

6017003,6,17,3,"As to Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, he hath no children except daughters, and these `are' the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah,"
6017004,6,17,4,"and they draw near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, `Jehovah commanded Moses to give to us an inheritance in the midst of our brethren;' and he giveth to them, at the command of Jehovah, an inheritance in the midst of the brethren of their father."
6017005,6,17,5,"And ten portions fall `to' Manasseh, apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan, which `are' beyond the Jordan;"
6017006,6,17,6,"for the daughters of Manasseh have inherited an inheritance in the midst of his sons, and the land of Gilead hath been to the sons of Manasseh who are left."
6017007,6,17,7,"And the border of Manasseh is from Asher to Michmethah, which `is' on the front of Shechem, and the border hath gone on unto the right, unto the inhabitants of En-Tappuah."

6017013,6,17,13,"and it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have been strong, that they put the Canaanite to tribute, and have not utterly dispossessed him."
6017014,6,17,14,"And the sons of Joseph speak with Joshua, saying, `Wherefore hast thou given to me an inheritance -- one lot and one portion, and I a numerous people? hitherto hath Jehovah blessed me.'"
6017015,6,17,15,"And Joshua saith unto them, `If thou `art' a numerous people, go up for thee to the forest, then thou hast prepared for thee there, in the land of the Perizzite, and of the Rephaim, when mount Ephraim hath been narrow for thee.'"
6017016,6,17,16,"And the sons of Joseph say, `The hill is not found to us, and a chariot of iron `is' with every Canaanite who is dwelling in the land of the valley -- to him who `is' in Beth-Shean and its towns, and to him who `is' in the valley of Jezreel.'"
6017017,6,17,17,"And Joshua speaketh unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, `Thou `art' a numerous people, and hast great power; thou hast not one lot `only',"
6017018,6,17,18,"because the mountain is thine; because it `is' a forest -- thou hast prepared it, and its outgoings have been thine; because thou dost dispossess the Canaanite, though it hath chariots of iron -- though it `is' strong.'"
6018001,6,18,1,"And all the company of the sons of Israel are assembled `at' Shiloh, and they cause the tent of meeting to tabernacle there, and the land hath been subdued before them."
6018002,6,18,2,"And there are left among the sons of Israel who have not shared their inheritance, seven tribes,"
6018003,6,18,3,"and Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel, `Till when are ye remiss to go in to possess the land which He hath given to you, Jehovah, God of your fathers?"
6018004,6,18,4,"Give for you three men for a tribe, and I send them, and they rise and go up and down through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and come in unto me,"
6018005,6,18,5,"and they have divided it into seven portions -- Judah doth stay by its border on the south, and the house of Joseph do stay by their border on the north --"
6018006,6,18,6,"and ye describe the land `in' seven portions, and have brought `it' in unto me hither, and I have cast for you a lot here before Jehovah our God;"
6018007,6,18,7,"for there is no portion to the Levites in your midst, for the priesthood of Jehovah `is' their inheritance, and Gad, and Reuben, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses servant of Jehovah gave to them.'"
6018008,6,18,8,"And the men rise and go; and Joshua commandeth those who are going to describe the land, saying, `Go, and walk up and down through the land, and describe it, and turn back unto me, and here I cast for you a lot before Jehovah in Shiloh.'"
6018009,6,18,9,"And the men go, and pass over through the land, and describe it by cities, in seven portions, on a book, and they come in unto Joshua, unto the camp, `at' Shiloh."
6018010,6,18,10,"And Joshua casteth for them a lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, and there Joshua apportioneth the land to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions."
6018011,6,18,11,"And a lot goeth up `for' the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, for their families; and the border of their lot goeth out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph."

6022002,6,22,2,"and saith unto them, `Ye -- ye have kept the whole of that which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, and ye hearken to my voice, to all that I have commanded you;"
6022003,6,22,3,"ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, and have kept the charge -- the command of Jehovah your God."
6022004,6,22,4,"`And, now, Jehovah your God hath given rest to your brethren, as He spake to them; and now, turn ye, and go for yourselves to your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses, servant of Jehovah, hath given to you beyond the Jordan."
6022005,6,22,5,"Only, be very watchful to do the command and the law which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and to cleave to Him, and to serve Him, with all your heart, and with all your soul.'"
6022006,6,22,6,"And Joshua blesseth them, and sendeth them away, and they go unto their tents."
6022007,6,22,7,"And to the half of the tribe of Manasseh hath Moses given, in Bashan, and to its `other' half hath Joshua given with their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; and also when Joshua hath sent them away unto their tents, then he doth bless them,"
6022008,6,22,8,"and speak unto them, saying, `With great riches turn ye back unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.'"
6022009,6,22,9,"And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, turn back and go from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which `is' in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, unto the land of their possession, in which they have possession, according to the command of Jehovah, by the hand of Moses;"
6022010,6,22,10,"and they come in unto the districts of the Jordan, which `are' in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, build there an altar by the Jordan -- a great altar for appearance."
6022011,6,22,11,"And the sons of Israel hear, saying, `Lo, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, have built the altar over-against the land of Canaan, on the districts of the Jordan, at the passage of the sons of Israel.'"
6022012,6,22,12,"And the sons of Israel hear, and all the company of the sons of Israel is assembled at Shiloh, to go up against them to war;"
6022013,6,22,13,"and the sons of Israel send unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh -- unto the land of Gilead -- Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest,"
6022014,6,22,14,"and ten princes with him, one prince, one prince, for a house of a father, for all the tribes of Israel, and each of them a head of a house of their fathers, for the thousands of Israel."
6022015,6,22,15,"And they come in unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and speak with them, saying,"
6022016,6,22,16,"`Thus said all the company of Jehovah, What `is' this trespass which ye have trespassed against the God of Israel, to turn back to-day from after Jehovah, by your building for you an altar, for your rebelling to-day against Jehovah?"
6022017,6,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor little to us, from which we have not been cleansed till this day -- and the plague is in the company of Jehovah,"
6022018,6,22,18,that ye turn back to-day from after Jehovah? and it hath been -- ye rebel to-day against Jehovah -- and to-morrow against all the company of Israel He is wroth.
6022019,6,22,19,"`And surely, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over for you unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the tabernacle of Jehovah hath tabernacled, and have possession in our midst; and against Jehovah rebel not, and against us rebel not, by your building for you an altar, besides the altar of Jehovah our God."
6022020,6,22,20,"Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and on all the company of Israel there was wrath? and he alone expired not in his iniquity.'"
6022021,6,22,21,"And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, answer and speak with the heads of the thousands of Israel:"
6022022,6,22,22,"`The God of gods -- Jehovah, the God of gods -- Jehovah, He is knowing, and Israel, he doth know, if in rebellion, and if in trespass against Jehovah (Thou dost not save us this day!)"
6022023,6,22,23,"`we are' building for ourselves an altar to turn back from after Jehovah, and if to cause to go up on it burnt-offering and present, and if to make on it peace-offerings -- Jehovah Himself doth require `it'."
6022024,6,22,24,"`And if not, from fear of `this' thing we have done it, saying, Hereafter your sons do speak to ours sons, saying, What to you and to Jehovah God of Israel?"
6022025,6,22,25,"for a border hath Jehovah put between us and you, O sons of Reuben, and sons of Gad -- Jordan; ye have no portion in Jehovah -- and your sons have caused our sons to cease, not to fear Jehovah."
6022026,6,22,26,"`And we say, Pray let us prepare for ourselves to build the altar -- not for burnt-offering nor for sacrifice --"
6022027,6,22,27,"but a witness it `is' between us and you, and between our generations after us, to do the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings, and your sons do not say hereafter to our sons, Ye have no portion in Jehovah."
6022028,6,22,28,"`And we say, And it hath been, when they say `so' unto us, and unto our generations hereafter, that we have said, See the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made -- not for burnt-offering nor for sacrifice -- but a witness it `is' between us and you."
6022029,6,22,29,"`Far be it from us to rebel against Jehovah, and to turn back to-day from after Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for present, and for sacrifice, apart from the altar of Jehovah our God, which `is' before His tabernacle.'"
6022030,6,22,30,"And Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the company, and the heads of the thousands of Israel, who `are' with him, hear the words which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh have spoken, and it is good in their eyes."
6022031,6,22,31,"And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest saith unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the sons of Manasseh, `To-day we have known that Jehovah `is' in our midst, because ye have not committed against Jehovah this trespass -- then ye have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.'"
6022032,6,22,32,"And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, turn back from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, unto the sons of Israel, and bring them back word;"
6022033,6,22,33,"and the thing is good in the eyes of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel bless God, and have not said to go up against them to war, to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, are dwelling in."
6022034,6,22,34,"And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad proclaim concerning the altar, that `it `is' a witness between us that Jehovah `is' God.'"
6023001,6,23,1,"And it cometh to pass, many days after that Jehovah hath given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua is old, entering into days,"
6023002,6,23,2,"and Joshua calleth for all Israel, for its elders, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its authorities, and saith unto them, `I have become old; I have entered into days;"
6023003,6,23,3,"and ye -- ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God `is' He who is fighting for you;"
6023004,6,23,4,"see, I have caused to fall to you these nations who are left for an inheritance to your tribes, from the Jordan, (and all the nations which I cut off), and the great sea, the going in of the sun."
6023005,6,23,5,"`As to Jehovah your God, He doth thrust them from your presence, and hath dispossessed them from before you, and ye have possessed their land, as Jehovah your God hath spoken to you,"
6023006,6,23,6,"and ye have been very strong to keep and to do the whole that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, so as not to turn aside from it right or left,"
6023007,6,23,7,"so as not to go in among these nations, these who are left with you; and of the name of their gods ye do not make mention, nor do ye swear, nor do ye serve them, nor do ye bow yourselves to them;"
6023008,6,23,8,"but to Jehovah your God ye do cleave, as ye have done till this day."
6023009,6,23,9,"And Jehovah is dispossessing from before you nations great and mighty; as for you, none hath stood in your presence till this day;"
6023010,6,23,10,"one man of you doth pursue a thousand, for Jehovah your God `is' He who is fighting for you, as He hath spoken to you;"
6023011,6,23,11,and ye have been very watchful for yourselves to love Jehovah your God.
6023012,6,23,12,"`But -- if ye at all turn back and have cleaved to the remnant of these nations, these who are left with you, and intermarried with them, and gone in to them, and they to you,"
6023013,6,23,13,"know certainly that Jehovah your God is not continuing to dispossess these nations from before you, and they have been to you for a gin, and for a snare, and for a scourge, in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till ye perish from off this good ground which Jehovah your God hath given to you."
6023014,6,23,14,"`And lo, I am going, to-day, in the way of all the earth, and ye have known -- with all your heart, and with all your soul -- that there hath not fallen one thing of all the good things which Jehovah your God hath spoken concerning you; the whole have come to you; there hath not failed of it one thing."
6023015,6,23,15,"`And it hath been, as there hath come upon you all the good thing which Jehovah your God hath spoken unto you, so doth Jehovah bring upon you the whole of the evil thing, till His destroying you from off this good ground which Jehovah your God hath given to you;"
6023016,6,23,16,"in your transgressing the covenant of Jehovah your God which He commanded you, and ye have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them, then hath the anger of Jehovah burned against you, and ye have perished hastily from off the good land which He hath given to you.'"
6024001,6,24,1,"And Joshua gathereth all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and calleth for the elders of Israel, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its authorities, and they station themselves before God."
6024002,6,24,2,"And Joshua saith unto all the people, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Beyond the River have your fathers dwelt of old -- Terah father of Abraham and father of Nachor -- and they serve other gods;"
6024003,6,24,3,"and I take your father Abraham from beyond the River, and cause him to go through all the land of Canaan, and multiply his seed, and give to him Isaac."
6024004,6,24,4,"And I give to Isaac, Jacob and Esau; and I give to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons have gone down to Egypt."
6024005,6,24,5,"And I send Moses and Aaron, and plague Egypt, as I have done in its midst, and afterwards I have brought you out."
6024006,6,24,6,"And I bring out your fathers from Egypt, and ye go into the sea, and the Egyptians pursue after your fathers, with chariot and with horsemen, to the Red Sea;"
6024007,6,24,7,"and they cry unto Jehovah, and He setteth thick darkness between you and the Egyptians, and bringeth on them the sea, and covereth them, and your eyes see that which I have done in Egypt; and ye dwell in a wilderness many days."
6024008,6,24,8,"`And I bring you in unto the land of the Amorite who is dwelling beyond the Jordan, and they fight with you, and I give them into your hand, and ye possess their land, and I destroy them out of your presence."
6024009,6,24,9,"`And Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, riseth and fighteth against Israel, and sendeth and calleth for Balaam son of Beor, to revile you,"
6024010,6,24,10,"and I have not been willing to hearken to Balaam, and he doth greatly bless you, and I deliver you out of his hand."
6024011,6,24,11,"`And ye pass over the Jordan, and come in unto Jericho, and fight against you do the possessors of Jericho -- the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite -- and I give them into your hand."
6024012,6,24,12,"And I send before you the hornet, and it casteth them out from your presence -- two kings of the Amorite -- not by thy sword, nor by thy bow."
6024013,6,24,13,"`And I give to you a land for which thou hast not laboured, and cities which ye have not built, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and olive-yards which ye have not planted ye are eating."
6024014,6,24,14,"`And now, fear ye Jehovah, and serve Him, in perfection and in truth, and turn aside the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Jehovah;"
6024015,6,24,15,"and if wrong in your eyes to serve Jehovah -- choose for you to-day whom ye do serve; -- whether the gods whom your fathers served, which `are' beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorite in whose land ye are dwelling; and I and my house -- we serve Jehovah.'"
6024016,6,24,16,"And the people answer and say, `Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;"
6024017,6,24,17,"for Jehovah our God `is' He who is bringing us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants, and who hath done before our eyes these great signs, and doth keep us in all the way in which we have gone, and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed;"
6024018,6,24,18,"and Jehovah casteth out the whole of the peoples, even the Amorite inhabiting the land, from our presence; we also do serve Jehovah, for He `is' our God.'"
6024019,6,24,19,"And Joshua saith unto the people, `Ye are not able to serve Jehovah, for a God most holy He `is'; a zealous God He `is'; He doth not bear with your transgression and with your sins."
6024020,6,24,20,"When ye forsake Jehovah, and have served gods of a stranger, then He hath turned back and done evil to you, and consumed you, after that He hath done good to you.'"
6024021,6,24,21,"And the people saith unto Joshua, `No, but Jehovah we do serve.'"
6024022,6,24,22,"And Joshua saith unto the people, `Witnesses ye are against yourselves, that ye have chosen for you Jehovah to serve Him (and they say, `Witnesses!')"
6024023,6,24,23,"and, now, turn aside the gods of the stranger which `are' in your midst, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, God of Israel.'"
6024024,6,24,24,"And the people say unto Joshua, `Jehovah our God we serve, and to His voice we hearken.'"
6024025,6,24,25,"And Joshua maketh a covenant with the people on that day, and layeth on it a statute and an ordinance, in Shechem."
6024026,6,24,26,"And Joshua writeth these words in the Book of the Law of God, and taketh a great stone, and raiseth it up there under the oak which `is' in the sanctuary of Jehovah."
6024027,6,24,27,"And Joshua saith unto all the people, `Lo, this stone is against us for a witness, for it hath heard all the sayings of Jehovah which He hath spoken with us, and it hath been against you for a witness, lest ye lie against your God.'"
6024028,6,24,28,"And Joshua sendeth the people away, each to his inheritance."
6024029,6,24,29,"And it cometh to pass, after these things, that Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten years,"
6024030,6,24,30,"and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-Serah, which `is' in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the hill of Gaash."
6024031,6,24,31,"And Israel serveth Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, and who knew all the work of Jehovah which He did to Israel."
6024032,6,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor father of Shechem, with a hundred kesitah; and they are to the sons of Joseph for an inheritance."
6024033,6,24,33,"And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they bury him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hill-country of Ephraim."
7001001,7,1,1,"And it cometh to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel ask at Jehovah, saying, `Who doth go up for us unto the Canaanite, at the commencement, to fight against it?'"
7001002,7,1,2,"And Jehovah saith, `Judah doth go up; lo, I have given the land into his hand.'"
7001003,7,1,3,"And Judah saith to Simeon his brother, `Go up with me into my lot, and we fight against the Canaanite -- and I have gone, even I, with thee into thy lot;' and Simeon goeth with him."
7001004,7,1,4,"And Judah goeth up, and Jehovah giveth the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand, and they smite them in Bezek -- ten thousand men;"
7001005,7,1,5,"and they find Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fight against him, and smite the Canaanite and the Perizzite."
7001006,7,1,6,"And Adoni-Bezek fleeth, and they pursue after him, and seize him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes,"
7001007,7,1,7,"and Adoni-Bezek saith, `Seventy kings -- their thumbs and their great toes cut off -- have been gathering under my table; as I have done so hath God repaid to me;' and they bring him in to Jerusalem, and he dieth there."
7001008,7,1,8,"And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem, and capture it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and the city they have sent into fire;"
7001009,7,1,9,"and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight against the Canaanite, inhabiting the hill-country, and the south, and the low country;"
7001010,7,1,10,"and Judah goeth unto the Canaanite who is dwelling in Hebron (and the name of Hebron formerly `is' Kirjath-Arba), and they smite Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai."
7001011,7,1,11,"And he goeth thence unto the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir formerly `is' Kirjath-Sepher),"
7001012,7,1,12,"and Caleb saith, `He who smiteth Kirjath-Sepher -- and hath captured it -- then I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.'"
7001013,7,1,13,"And Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, doth capture it, and he giveth to him Achsah his daughter for a wife."
7001014,7,1,14,"And it cometh to pass in her coming in, that she persuadeth him to ask from her father the field, and she lighteth from off the ass, and Caleb saith to her, `What -- to thee?'"
7001015,7,1,15,"And she saith to him, `Give to me a blessing; when the south land thou hast given me -- then thou hast given to me springs of water; and Caleb giveth to her the upper springs and the lower springs."
7001016,7,1,16,"And the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, have gone up out of the city of palms with the sons of Judah `to' the wilderness of Judah, which `is' in the south of Arad, and they go and dwell with the people."
7001017,7,1,17,"And Judah goeth with Simeon his brother, and they smite the Canaanite inhabiting Zephath, and devote it; and `one' calleth the name of the city Hormah."
7001018,7,1,18,"And Judah captureth Gaza and its border, and Askelon and its border, and Ekron and its border;"
7001019,7,1,19,"and Jehovah is with Judah, and he occupieth the hill-country, but not to dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, for they have chariots of iron."
7001020,7,1,20,"And they give to Caleb Hebron, as Moses hath spoken, and he dispossesseth thence the three sons of Anak."
7001021,7,1,21,"And the Jebusite, inhabiting Jerusalem, the sons of Benjamin have not dispossessed; and the Jebusite dwelleth with the sons of Benjamin, in Jerusalem, till this day."
7001022,7,1,22,"And the house of Joseph go up -- even they -- to Beth-El, and Jehovah `is' with them;"
7001023,7,1,23,"and the house of Joseph cause `men' to spy about Beth-El (and the name of the city formerly is Luz),"
7001024,7,1,24,"and the watchers see a man coming out from the city, and say to him, `Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance of the city, and we have done with thee kindness.'"
7001025,7,1,25,"And he sheweth them the entrance of the city, and they smite the city by the mouth of the sword, and the man and all his family they have sent away;"
7001026,7,1,26,"and the man goeth to the land of the Hittites, and buildeth a city, and calleth its name Luz -- it `is' its name unto this day."
7001027,7,1,27,"And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns, and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in that land;"
7001028,7,1,28,"and it cometh to pass, when Israel hath been strong, that he setteth the Canaanite to tribute, and hath not utterly dispossessed it."
7001029,7,1,29,"And Ephraim hath not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its midst, in Gezer."
7001030,7,1,30,"Zebulun hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Kitron, and the inhabitants of Nahalol, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its midst, and they become tributary."
7001031,7,1,31,"Asher hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Accho, and the inhabitants of Zidon, and Ahlab, and Achzib, and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob;"
7001032,7,1,32,"and the Asherite dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the land, for it hath not dispossessed them."
7001033,7,1,33,"Naphtali hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, and he dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath have become tributary to them."
7001034,7,1,34,"And the Amorites press the sons of Dan to the mountain, for they have not suffered them to go down to the valley;"
7001035,7,1,35,"and the Amorite is desirous to dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and the hand of the house of Joseph is heavy, and they become tributary;"
7001036,7,1,36,"and the border of the Amorite `is' from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock and upward."
7002001,7,2,1,"And a messenger of Jehovah goeth up from Gilgal unto Bochim,"
7002002,7,2,2,"and saith, `I cause you to come up out of Egypt, and bring you in unto the land which I have sworn to your fathers, and say, I do not break My covenant with you to the age; and ye -- ye make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land -- their altars ye break down; and ye have not hearkened to My voice -- what `is' this ye have done?"
7002003,7,2,3,"And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their gods are to you for a snare.'"
7002004,7,2,4,"And it cometh to pass, when the messenger of Jehovah speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the people lift up their voice and weep,"
7002005,7,2,5,"and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice there to Jehovah."
7002006,7,2,6,"And Joshua sendeth the people away, and the sons of Israel go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;"
7002007,7,2,7,"and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw all the great work of Jehovah which He did to Israel."
7002008,7,2,8,"And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten years,"
7002009,7,2,9,"and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of mount Gaash;"
7002010,7,2,10,"and also all that generation have been gathered unto their fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not known Jehovah, and even the work which He hath done to Israel."
7002011,7,2,11,"And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and serve the Baalim,"
7002012,7,2,12,"and forsake Jehovah, God of their fathers, who bringeth them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods (of the gods of the peoples who `are' round about them), and bow themselves to them, and provoke Jehovah,"
7002013,7,2,13,"yea, they forsake Jehovah, and do service to Baal and to Ashtaroth."
7002014,7,2,14,"And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He giveth them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;"
7002015,7,2,15,"in every `place' where they have gone out, the hand of Jehovah hath been against them for evil, as Jehovah hath spoken, and as Jehovah hath sworn to them, and they are distressed -- greatly."
7002016,7,2,16,"And Jehovah raiseth up judges, and they save them from the hand of their spoilers;"
7002017,7,2,17,"and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to them; they have turned aside `with' haste out of the way `in' which their fathers walked to obey the commands of Jehovah -- they have not done so."
7002018,7,2,18,"And when Jehovah raised up to them judges -- then was Jehovah with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repenteth Jehovah, because of their groaning from the presence of their oppressors, and of those thrusting them away."
7002019,7,2,19,"And it hath come to pass, at the death of the judge -- they turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them; they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff way."
7002020,7,2,20,"And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel, and He saith, `Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My voice --"
7002021,7,2,21,"I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of the nations which Joshua hath left when he dieth,"
7002022,7,2,22,"in order to try Israel by them, whether they are keeping the way of Jehovah, to go in it, as their fathers kept `it' or not.'"
7002023,7,2,23,"And Jehovah leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua."
7003001,7,3,1,"And these `are' the nations which Jehovah left, to try Israel by them, all who have not known all the wars of Canaan;"
7003002,7,3,2,"(only for the sake of the generations of the sons of Israel's knowing, to teach them war, only those who formerly have not known them) --"
7003003,7,3,3,"five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanite, and the Zidonian, and the Hivite inhabiting mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath;"
7003004,7,3,4,"and they are to prove Israel by them, to know whether they obey the commands of Jehovah that He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses."
7003005,7,3,5,"And the sons of Israel have dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,"
7003006,7,3,6,"and take their daughters to them for wives, and their daughters have given to their sons, and they serve their gods;"
7003007,7,3,7,"and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and forget Jehovah their God, and serve the Baalim and the shrines."
7003008,7,3,8,"And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim king of Aram-Naharaim, and the sons of Israel serve Chushan-Rishathaim eight years;"
7003009,7,3,9,"and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he saveth them -- Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother;"
7003010,7,3,10,"and the Spirit of Jehovah is upon him, and he judgeth Israel, and goeth out to battle, and Jehovah giveth unto his hand Chushan-Rishathaim king of Aram, and strong is his hand against Chushan-Rishathaim;"
7003011,7,3,11,"and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz dieth,"
7003012,7,3,12,"and the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengtheneth Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because that they have done the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah;"
7003013,7,3,13,"and he gathereth unto him the Bene-Ammon and Amalek, and goeth and smiteth Israel, and they possess the city of palms;"
7003014,7,3,14,and the sons of Israel serve Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
7003015,7,3,15,"And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth to them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite (a man -- shut of his right hand), and the sons of Israel send by his hand a present to Eglon king of Moab;"
7003016,7,3,16,"and Ehud maketh for himself a sword, and it hath two mouths (a cubit `is' its length), and he girdeth it under his long robe on his right thigh;"
7003017,7,3,17,"and he bringeth near the present to Eglon king of Moab, and Eglon `is' a very fat man."
7003018,7,3,18,"And it cometh to pass, when he hath finished to bring near the present, that he sendeth away the people bearing the present,"
7003019,7,3,19,"and he himself hath turned back from the graven images which `are' at Gilgal, and saith, `A secret word I have unto thee, O king;' and he saith, `Hush!' and go out from him do all those standing by him."
7003020,7,3,20,"And Ehud hath come unto him, and he is sitting in the upper chamber of the wall which he hath for himself, and Ehud saith, `A word of God I have unto thee;' and he riseth from off the throne;"
7003021,7,3,21,"and Ehud putteth forth his left hand, and taketh the sword from off his right thigh, and striketh it into his belly;"
7003022,7,3,22,"and the haft also goeth in after the blade, and the fat shutteth on the blade, that he hath not drawn the sword out of his belly, and it goeth out at the fundament."
7003023,7,3,23,"And Ehud goeth out at the porch, and shutteth the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and hath bolted `it';"
7003024,7,3,24,"and he hath gone out, and his servants have come in, and look, and lo, the doors of the upper chamber are bolted, and they say, `He is only covering his feet in the inner chamber of the wall.'"
7003025,7,3,25,"And they stay till confounded, and lo, he is not opening the doors of the upper chamber, and they take the key, and open, and lo, their lord is fallen to the earth -- dead."
7003026,7,3,26,"And Ehud escaped during their tarrying, and hath passed by the images, and is escaped to Seirath."
7003027,7,3,27,"And it cometh to pass, in his coming in, that he bloweth with a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and go down with him do the sons of Israel from the hill-country, and he before them;"
7003028,7,3,28,"and he saith unto them, `Pursue after me, for Jehovah hath given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand;' and they go down after him, and capture the passages of the Jordan towards Moab, and have not permitted a man to pass over."
7003029,7,3,29,"And they smite Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all robust, and every one a man of valour, and not a man hath escaped,"
7003030,7,3,30,and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel; and the land resteth eighty years.
7003031,7,3,31,"And after him hath been Shamgar son of Anath, and he smiteth the Philistines -- six hundred men -- with an ox-goad, and he saveth -- he also -- Israel."
7004001,7,4,1,"And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah when Ehud is dead,"
7004002,7,4,2,"and Jehovah selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who hath reigned in Hazor, and the head of his host `is' Sisera, and he is dwelling in Harosheth of the Goyim;"
7004003,7,4,3,"and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, for he hath nine hundred chariots of iron, and he hath oppressed the sons of Israel mightily twenty years."
7004004,7,4,4,"And Deborah, a woman inspired, wife of Lapidoth, she is judging Israel at that time,"
7004005,7,4,5,"and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel go up unto her for judgment."
7004006,7,4,6,"And she sendeth and calleth for Barak son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and saith unto him, `Hath not Jehovah, God of Israel, commanded? go, and thou hast drawn towards mount Tabor, and hast taken with thee ten thousand men, out of the sons of Naphtali, and out of the sons of Zebulun,"
7004007,7,4,7,"and I have drawn unto thee, unto the brook Kishon, Sisera, head of the host of Jabin, and his chariot, and his multitude, and have given him into thy hand.'"
7004008,7,4,8,"And Barak saith unto her, `If thou dost go with me, then I have gone; and if thou dost not go with me, I do not go;'"
7004009,7,4,9,"and she saith, `I do certainly go with thee; only, surely thy glory is not on the way which thou art going, for into the hand of a woman doth Jehovah sell Sisera;' and Deborah riseth and goeth with Barak to Kedesh."
7004010,7,4,10,"And Barak calleth Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he goeth up -- at his feet `are' ten thousand men -- and Deborah goeth up with him."
7004011,7,4,11,"And Heber the Kenite hath been separated from the Kenite, from the sons of Hobab father-in-law of Moses, and he stretcheth out his tent unto the oak in Zaanaim, which `is' by Kedesh."
7004012,7,4,12,"And they declare to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam hath gone up to mount Tabor,"
7004013,7,4,13,"and Sisera calleth all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who `are' with him, from Harosheth of the Goyim, unto the brook Kishon."
7004014,7,4,14,"And Deborah saith unto Barak, `Rise, for this `is' the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand; hath not Jehovah gone out before thee?' And Barak goeth down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him."
7004015,7,4,15,"And Jehovah destroyeth Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the camp, by the mouth of the sword, before Barak, and Sisera cometh down from off the chariot, and fleeth on his feet."
7004016,7,4,16,"And Barak hath pursued after the chariots and after the camp, unto Harosheth of the Goyim, and all the camp of Sisera falleth by the mouth of the sword -- there hath not been left even one."
7004017,7,4,17,"And Sisera hath fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite, for peace `is' between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite;"
7004018,7,4,18,"and Jael goeth out to meet Sisera, and saith unto him, `Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me, fear not;' and he turneth aside unto her, into the tent, and she covereth him with a coverlet."
7004019,7,4,19,"And he saith unto her, `Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water, for I am thirsty;' and she openeth the bottle of milk, and giveth him to drink, and covereth him."
7004020,7,4,20,"And he saith unto her, `Stand at the opening of the tent, and it hath been, if any doth come in, and hath asked thee, and said, Is there a man here? that thou hast said, There is not.'"
7004021,7,4,21,"And Jael wife of Heber taketh the pin of the tent, and taketh the hammer in her hand, and goeth unto him gently, and striketh the pin into his temples, and it fasteneth in the earth -- and he hath been fast asleep, and is weary -- and he dieth."
7004022,7,4,22,"And lo, Barak is pursuing Sisera, and Jael cometh out to meet him, and saith to him, `Come, and I shew thee the man whom thou art seeking;' and he cometh in unto her, and lo, Sisera is fallen -- dead, and the pin in his temples."
7004023,7,4,23,"And God humbleth on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel,"
7004024,7,4,24,"and the hand of the sons of Israel goeth, going on and becoming hard on Jabin king of Canaan, till that they have cut off Jabin king of Canaan."
7005001,7,5,1,"And Deborah singeth -- also Barak son of Abinoam -- on that day, saying: --"
7005002,7,5,2,"`For freeing freemen in Israel, For a people willingly offering themselves Bless ye Jehovah."
7005003,7,5,3,"Hear, ye kings; give ear, ye princes, I, to Jehovah, I -- I do sing, I sing praise to Jehovah, God of Israel."
7005004,7,5,4,"Jehovah, in Thy going forth out of Seir, In Thy stepping out of the field of Edom, Earth trembled, also the heavens dropped, Also thick clouds dropped water."
7005005,7,5,5,"Hills flowed from the face of Jehovah, This one -- Sinai -- From the face of Jehovah, God of Israel."
7005006,7,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath -- In the days of Jael -- The ways have ceased, And those going in the paths go `in' crooked ways."
7005007,7,5,7,"Villages ceased in Israel -- they ceased, Till that I arose -- Deborah, That I arose, a mother in Israel."
7005008,7,5,8,"He chooseth new gods, Then war `is' at the gates! A shield is not seen -- and a spear Among forty thousand in Israel."
7005009,7,5,9,"My heart `is' to the lawgivers of Israel, Who are offering themselves willingly among the people, Bless ye Jehovah!"
7005010,7,5,10,Riders on white asses -- Sitters on a long robe -- And walkers by the way -- meditate!
7005011,7,5,11,"By the voice of shouters Between the places of drawing water, There they give out righteous acts of Jehovah, Righteous acts of His villages in Israel, Then ruled in the gates have the people of Jehovah."
7005012,7,5,12,"Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song; Rise, Barak, and take captive thy captivity, Son of Abinoam."
7005013,7,5,13,"Then him who is left of the honourable ones He caused to rule the people of Jehovah, He caused me to rule among the mighty."
7005014,7,5,14,"Out of Ephraim their root `is' against Amalek. After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down lawgivers, And out of Zebulun those drawing with the reed of a writer."
7005015,7,5,15,"And princes in Issachar `are' with Deborah, Yea, Issachar `is' right with Barak, Into the valley he was sent on his feet. In the divisions of Reuben, Great `are' the decrees of heart!"
7005016,7,5,16,"Why hast thou abode between the boundaries, To hear lowings of herds? For the divisions of Reuben, Great `are' the searchings of heart!"
7005017,7,5,17,"Gilead beyond the Jordan did tabernacle, And Dan -- why doth he sojourn `in' ships? Asher hath abode at the haven of the seas, And by his creeks doth tabernacle."
7005018,7,5,18,"Zebulun `is' a people who exposed its soul to death, Naphtali also -- on high places of the field."
7005019,7,5,19,"Kings came -- they fought; Then fought kings of Canaan, In Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; Gain of money they took not!"
7005020,7,5,20,From the heavens they fought: The stars from their highways fought with Sisera.
7005021,7,5,21,"The brook Kishon swept them away, The brook most ancient -- the brook Kishon. Thou dost tread down strength, O my soul!"
7005022,7,5,22,"Then broken were the horse-heels, By pransings -- pransings of its mighty ones."
7005023,7,5,23,"Curse Meroz -- said a messenger of Jehovah, Cursing, curse ye its inhabitants, For they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah among the mighty!"
7005024,7,5,24,"Blessed above women is Jael, Wife of Heber the Kenite, Above women in the tent she is blessed."
7005025,7,5,25,Water he asked -- milk she gave; In a lordly dish she brought near butter.
7005026,7,5,26,"Her hand to the pin she sendeth forth, And her right hand to the labourers' hammer, And she hammered Sisera -- she smote his head, Yea, she smote, and it passed through his temple."
7005027,7,5,27,"Between her feet he bowed -- He fell, he lay down; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell -- destroyed."
7005028,7,5,28,"Through the window she hath looked out -- Yea, she crieth out -- the mother of Sisera, Through the lattice: Wherefore is his chariot delaying to come? Wherefore tarried have the steps of his chariot?"
7005029,7,5,29,"The wise ones, her princesses, answer her, Yea, she returneth her sayings to herself:"
7005030,7,5,30,"Do they not find? -- they apportion spoil, A female -- two females -- for every head, Spoil of finger-work for Sisera, Spoil of embroidered finger-work, Finger-work -- a pair of embroidered things, For the necks of the spoil!"
7005031,7,5,31,"So do all Thine enemies perish, O Jehovah, And those loving Him `are' As the going out of the sun in its might!' and the land resteth forty years."
7006001,7,6,1,"And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of Midian seven years,"
7006002,7,6,2,"and the hand of Midian is strong against Israel, from the presence of Midian have the sons of Israel made for themselves the flowings which `are' in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds."
7006003,7,6,3,"And it hath been, if Israel hath sowed, that Midian hath come up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east, yea, they have come up against him,"
7006004,7,6,4,"and encamp against them, and destroy the increase of the land till thine entering Gaza; and they leave no sustenance in Israel, either sheep, or ox, or ass;"
7006005,7,6,5,"for they and their cattle come up, with their tents; they come in as the fulness of the locust for multitude, and of them and of their cattle there is no number, and they come into the land to destroy it."
7006006,7,6,6,"And Israel is very weak from the presence of Midian, and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah."
7006007,7,6,7,"And it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have cried unto Jehovah, concerning Midian,"
7006008,7,6,8,"that Jehovah sendeth a man, a prophet, unto the sons of Israel, and he saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I -- I have brought you up out of Egypt, and I bring you out from a house of servants,"
7006009,7,6,9,"and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all your oppressors, and I cast them out from your presence, and I give to you their land,"
7006010,7,6,10,"and I say to you, I `am' Jehovah your God, ye do not fear the gods of the Amorite in whose land ye are dwelling: -- and ye have not hearkened to My voice.'"
7006011,7,6,11,"And the messenger of Jehovah cometh and sitteth under the oak which `is' in Ophrah, which `is' to Joash the Abi-Ezrite, and Gideon his son is beating out wheat in the wine-press, to remove `it' from the presence of the Midianites;"
7006012,7,6,12,"and the messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto him, and saith unto him, `Jehovah `is' with thee, O mighty one of valour.'"
7006013,7,6,13,"And Gideon saith unto him, `O, my lord -- and Jehovah is with us! -- and why hath all this found us? and where `are' all His wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Hath not Jehovah brought us up out of Egypt? and now Jehovah hath left us, and doth give us into the hand of Midian.'"
7006014,7,6,14,"And Jehovah turneth unto him and saith, `Go in this -- thy power; and thou hast saved Israel out of the hand of Midian -- have not I sent thee.'"
7006015,7,6,15,"And he saith unto him, `O, my lord, wherewith do I save Israel? lo, my chief `is' weak in Manasseh, and I the least in the house of my father.'"
7006016,7,6,16,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `Because I am with thee -- thou hast smitten the Midianites as one man.'"
7006017,7,6,17,"And he saith unto Him, `If, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, then Thou hast done for me a sign that Thou art speaking with me."
7006018,7,6,18,"Move not, I pray Thee, from this, till my coming in unto Thee, and I have brought out my present, and put it before Thee;' and he saith, `I -- I do abide till thy return.'"
7006019,7,6,19,"And Gideon hath gone in, and prepareth a kid of the goats, and of an ephah of flour unleavened things; the flesh he hath put in a basket, and the broth he hath put in a pot, and he bringeth out unto Him, unto the place of the oak, and bringeth `it' nigh."
7006020,7,6,20,"And the messenger of God saith unto him, `Take the flesh and the unleavened things, and place on this rock -- and the broth pour out;' and he doth so."
7006021,7,6,21,"And the messenger of Jehovah putteth forth the end of the staff which `is' in His hand, and cometh against the flesh, and against the unleavened things, and the fire goeth up out of the rock and consumeth the flesh and the unleavened things -- and the messenger of Jehovah hath gone from his eyes."
7006022,7,6,22,"And Gideon seeth that He `is' a messenger of Jehovah, and Gideon saith, `Alas, Lord Jehovah! because that I have seen a messenger of Jehovah face to face!'"
7006023,7,6,23,"And Jehovah saith to him, `Peace to thee; fear not; thou dost not die.'"
7006024,7,6,24,"And Gideon buildeth there an altar to Jehovah, and calleth it Jehovah-Shalom, unto this day it `is' yet in Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrites."
7006025,7,6,25,"And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith to him, `Take the young ox which `is' to thy father, and the second bullock of seven years, and thou hast thrown down the altar of Baal which `is' to thy father, and the shrine which `is' by it thou dost cut down,"
7006026,7,6,26,"and thou hast built an altar to Jehovah thy God on the top of this stronghold, by the arrangement, and hast taken the second bullock, and caused to ascend a burnt-offering with the wood of the shrine which thou cuttest down.'"
7006027,7,6,27,"And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants, and doth as Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and it cometh to pass, because he hath been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the city, to do `it' by day, that he doth `it' by night."
7006028,7,6,28,"And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and lo, broken down hath been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which is by it hath been cut down, and the second bullock hath been offered on the altar which is built."
7006029,7,6,29,"And they say one to another, `Who hath done this thing?' and they inquire and seek, and they say, `Gideon son of Joash hath done this thing.'"
7006030,7,6,30,"And the men of the city say unto Joash, `Bring out thy son, and he dieth, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the shrine which `is' by it.'"
7006031,7,6,31,"And Joash saith to all who have stood against him, `Ye, do ye plead for Baal? ye -- do ye save him? he who pleadeth for him is put to death during the morning; if he `is' a god he himself doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.'"
7006032,7,6,32,"And he calleth him, on that day, Jerubbaal, saying, `The Baal doth plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.'"
7006033,7,6,33,"And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley of Jezreel,"
7006034,7,6,34,"and the Spirit of Jehovah hath clothed Gideon, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and Abi-Ezer is called after him;"
7006035,7,6,35,"and messengers he hath sent into all Manasseh, and it also is called after him; and messengers he hath sent into Asher, and into Zebulun, and into Naphtali, and they come up to meet them."
7006036,7,6,36,"And Gideon saith unto God, `If Thou art Saviour of Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,"
7006037,7,6,37,"lo, I am placing the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor: if dew is on the fleece alone, and on all the earth drought -- then I have known that Thou dost save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken;'"
7006038,7,6,38,"and it is so, and he riseth early on the morrow, and presseth the fleece, and wringeth dew out of the fleece -- the fulness of the bowl, of water."
7006039,7,6,39,"And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let there be dew.'"
7006040,7,6,40,"And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew."
7007001,7,7,1,"And Jerubbaal (he `is' Gideon) riseth early, and all the people who `are' with him, and they encamp by the well of Harod, and the camp of Midian hath been on the south of him, on the height of Moreh, in the valley."
7007002,7,7,2,"And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Too many `are' the people who `are' with thee for My giving Midian into their hand, lest Israel beautify itself against Me, saying, My hand hath given salvation to me;"
7007003,7,7,3,"and now, call, I pray thee, in the ears of the people, saying, Whoso `is' afraid and trembling, let him turn back and go early from mount Gilead;' and there turn back of the people twenty and two thousand, and ten thousand have been left."
7007004,7,7,4,"And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Yet `are' the people too many; bring them down unto the water, and I refine it for thee there; and it hath been, he of whom I say unto thee, This doth go with thee -- he doth go with thee; and any of whom I say unto thee, This doth not go with thee -- he doth not go.'"
7007005,7,7,5,"And he bringeth down the people unto the water, and Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Every one who lappeth with his tongue of the water as the dog lappeth -- thou dost set him apart; also every one who boweth on his knees to drink.'"
7007006,7,7,6,"And the number of those lapping with their hand unto their mouth is three hundred men, and all the rest of the people have bowed down on their knees to drink water."
7007007,7,7,7,"And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `By the three hundred men who are lapping I save you, and have given Midian into thy hand, and all the people go, each to his place.'"
7007008,7,7,8,"And the people take the provision in their hand, and their trumpets, and every man of Israel he hath sent away, each to his tents; and on the three hundred men he hath kept hold, and the camp of Midian hath been by him at the lower part of the valley."
7007009,7,7,9,"And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith unto him, `Rise, go down into the camp, for I have given it into thy hand;"
7007010,7,7,10,"and if thou art afraid to go down -- go down, thou and Phurah thy young man, unto the camp,"
7007011,7,7,11,"and thou hast heard what they speak, and afterwards are thy hands strengthened, and thou hast gone down against the camp.' And he goeth down, he and Phurah his young man, unto the extremity of the fifties who `are' in the camp;"
7007012,7,7,12,"and Midian and Amalek, and all the sons of the east are lying in the valley, as the locust for multitude, and of their camels there is no number, as sand which `is' on the sea-shore for multitude."
7007013,7,7,13,"And Gideon cometh in, and lo, a man is recounting to his companion a dream, and saith, `Lo, a dream I have dreamed, and lo, a cake of barley-bread is turning itself over into the camp of Midian, and it cometh in unto the tent, and smiteth it, and it falleth, and turneth it upwards, and the tent hath fallen.'"
7007014,7,7,14,"And his companion answereth and saith, `This is nothing save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God hath given into his hand Midian and all the camp.'"
7007015,7,7,15,"And it cometh to pass, when Gideon heareth the narration of the dream and its interpretation, that he boweth himself, and turneth back unto the camp of Israel, and saith, `Rise ye, for Jehovah hath given into your hand the camp of Midian.'"
7007016,7,7,16,"And he divideth the three hundred men `into' three detachments, and putteth trumpets into the hand of all of them, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."
7007017,7,7,17,"And he saith unto them, `Look at me, and thus do; and lo, I am coming into the extremity of the camp -- and it hath been -- as I do so ye do;"
7007018,7,7,18,"and I have blown with a trumpet -- I and all who `are' with me, and ye have blown with trumpets, even ye, round about all the camp, and have said, For Jehovah and for Gideon.'"
7007019,7,7,19,"And Gideon cometh -- and the hundred men who `are' with him -- into the extremity of the camp, `at' the beginning of the middle watch (it hath only just confirmed the watchmen), and they blow with trumpets -- dashing in pieces also the pitchers which `are' in their hand;"
7007020,7,7,20,"and the three detachments blow with trumpets, and break the pitchers, and keep hold with their left hand on the lamps, and with their right hand on the trumpets to blow, and they cry, `The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.'"
7007021,7,7,21,"And they stand each in his place, round about the camp, and all the camp runneth, and they shout, and flee;"
7007022,7,7,22,"and the three hundred blow the trumpets, and Jehovah setteth the sword of each against his companion, even through all the camp; and the camp fleeth unto Beth-Shittah, at Zererath, unto the border of Abel-Meholah, by Tabbath."
7007023,7,7,23,"And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from all Manasseh, and pursue after Midian."
7007024,7,7,24,"And messengers hath sent Gideon into all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, `Come down to meet Midian, and capture before them the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan;' and every man of Ephraim is called, and they capture the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan,"
7007025,7,7,25,"and they capture two of the heads of Midian, Oreb, and Zeeb, and slay Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they have slain at the wine-vat of Zeeb, and they pursue unto Midian; and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they have brought in unto Gideon beyond the Jordan."
7008001,7,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim say unto him, `What `is' this thing thou hast done to us -- not to call for us when thou didst go to fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;"
7008002,7,8,2,"and he saith unto them, `What have I done now like you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the harvest of Abi-Ezer?"
7008003,7,8,3,"Into your hand hath God given the heads of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what have I been able to do like you?' Then their temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing."
7008004,7,8,4,"And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and the three hundred men who `are' with him -- wearied, and pursuing,"
7008005,7,8,5,"and he saith to the men of Succoth, `Give, I pray you, cakes of bread to the people who `are' at my feet, for they `are' wearied, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian.'"
7008006,7,8,6,"And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?'"
7008007,7,8,7,"And Gideon saith, `Therefore -- in Jehovah's giving Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand -- I have threshed your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and with the threshing instruments.'"
7008008,7,8,8,"And he goeth up thence `to' Penuel, and speaketh unto them thus; and the men of Penuel answer him as the men of Succoth answered."
7008009,7,8,9,"And he speaketh also to the men of Penuel, saying, `In my turning back in peace, I break down this tower.'"
7008010,7,8,10,"And Zebah and Zalmunna `are' in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand, all who are left of all the camp of the sons of the east; and those falling `are' a hundred and twenty thousand men, drawing sword."
7008011,7,8,11,"And Gideon goeth up the way of those who tabernacle in tents, on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smiteth the camp, and the camp was confident;"
7008012,7,8,12,"and Zebab and Zalmunna flee, and he pursueth after them, and captureth the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and all the camp he hath caused to tremble."
7008013,7,8,13,"And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle, at the going up of the sun,"
7008014,7,8,14,"and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth, and asketh him, and he describeth unto him the heads of Succoth, and its elders -- seventy and seven men."
7008015,7,8,15,"And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth, and saith, `Lo Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we give to thy men who `are' wearied bread?'"
7008016,7,8,16,"And he taketh the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them the men of Succoth,"
7008017,7,8,17,"and the tower of Penuel he hath broken down, and slayeth the men of the city."
7008018,7,8,18,"And he saith unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna, `How -- the men whom ye slew in Tabor?' and they say, `As thou -- so they, one -- as the form of the king's sons.'"
7008019,7,8,19,"And he saith, `My brethren -- sons of my mother -- they; Jehovah liveth, if ye had kept them alive -- I had not slain you.'"
7008020,7,8,20,"And he saith to Jether his first-born, `Rise, slay them;' and the young man hath not drawn his sword, for he hath been afraid, for he `is' yet a youth."
7008021,7,8,21,"And Zebah saith -- also Zalmunna -- `Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man -- his might;' and Gideon riseth, and slayeth Zebah and Zalmunna, and taketh their round ornaments which `are' on the necks of their camels."
7008022,7,8,22,"And the men of Israel say unto Gideon, `Rule over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian.'"
7008023,7,8,23,"And Gideon saith unto them, `I do not rule over you, nor doth my son rule over you; Jehovah doth rule over you.'"
7008024,7,8,24,"And Gideon saith unto them, `Let me ask of you a petition, and give ye to me each the ring of his prey, for they have rings of gold, for they `are' Ishmaelites.'"
7008025,7,8,25,"And they say, `We certainly give;' and they spread out the garment, and cast thither each the ring of his prey;"
7008026,7,8,26,"and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a thousand and seven hundred `shekels' of gold, apart from the round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which `are' on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which `are' on the necks of their camels,"
7008027,7,8,27,"and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare."
7008028,7,8,28,"And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have not added to lift up their head; and the land resteth forty years in the days of Gideon."
7008029,7,8,29,"And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own house,"
7008030,7,8,30,"and to Gideon there have been seventy sons, coming out of his loin, for he had many wives;"
7008031,7,8,31,"and his concubine, who `is' in Shechem, hath born to him -- even she -- a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech."
7008032,7,8,32,"And Gideon son of Joash dieth, in a good old age, and is buried in the burying-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrite."
7008033,7,8,33,"And it cometh to pass, when Gideon `is' dead, that the sons of Israel turn back and go a-whoring after the Baalim, and set over them Baal-Berith for a god;"
7008034,7,8,34,"and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies round about,"
7008035,7,8,35,neither have they done kindness with the house of Jerubbaal -- Gideon -- according to all the good which he did with Israel.
7009001,7,9,1,"and Abimelech son of Jerubbaal goeth to Shechem, unto his mother's brethren, and speaketh unto them, and unto all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
7009002,7,9,2,"`Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the masters of Shechem, Which `is' good for you -- the ruling over you of seventy men (all the sons of Jerubbaal), or the ruling over you of one man? -- and ye have remembered that I `am' your bone and your flesh.'"
7009003,7,9,3,"And his mother's brethren speak concerning him, in the ears of all the masters of Shechem, all these words, and their heart inclineth after Abimelech, for they said, `He `is' our brother;'"
7009004,7,9,4,"and they give to him seventy silverings out of the house of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech hireth with them men, vain and unstable, and they go after him;"
7009005,7,9,5,"and he goeth into the house of his father at Ophrah, and slayeth his brethren, sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone; and Jotham, youngest son of Jerubbaal, is left, for he was hidden."
7009006,7,9,6,"And all the masters of Shechem are gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and come and cause Abimelech to reign for king at the oak of the camp which `is' in Shechem;"
7009007,7,9,7,"and they declare `it' to Jotham, and he goeth and standeth on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifteth up his voice, and calleth, and saith to them, `Hearken unto me, O masters of Shechem, and God doth hearken unto you:"
7009008,7,9,8,"`The trees have diligently gone to anoint over them a king, and they say to the olive, Reign thou over us."
7009009,7,9,9,"And the olive saith to them, Have I ceased from my fatness, by which they honour gods and men, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?"
7009010,7,9,10,"And the trees say to the fig, Come thou, reign over us."
7009011,7,9,11,"And the fig saith to them, Have I ceased from my sweetness, and my good increase, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?"
7009012,7,9,12,"`And the trees say to the vine, Come thou, reign over us."
7009013,7,9,13,"And the vine saith to them, Have I ceased from my new wine, which is rejoicing gods and men, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?"
7009014,7,9,14,"And all the trees say unto the bramble, Come thou, reign over us."
7009015,7,9,15,"And the bramble saith unto the trees, If in truth ye are anointing me for king over you, come, take refuge in my shadow; and if not -- fire cometh out from the bramble, and devoureth the cedars of Lebanon."
7009016,7,9,16,"`And, now, if in truth and in sincerity ye have acted, when ye make Abimelech king; and if ye have done good with Jerubbaal, and with his house; and if according to the deed of his hands ye have done to him --"
7009017,7,9,17,"because my father hath fought for you, and doth cast away his life from `him', and deliver you from the hand of Midian;"
7009018,7,9,18,"and ye have risen against the house of my father to-day, and slay his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and cause Abimelech son of his handmaid to reign over the masters of Shechem, because he `is' your brother --"
7009019,7,9,19,"yea, if in truth and in sincerity ye have acted with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and he doth rejoice -- even he -- in you;"
7009020,7,9,20,"and if not -- fire cometh out from Abimelech and devoureth the masters of Shechem and the house of Millo, and fire cometh out from the masters of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and devoureth Abimelech.'"
7009021,7,9,21,"And Jotham hasteth, and fleeth, and goeth to Beer, and dwelleth there, from the face of Abimelech his brother."
7009022,7,9,22,"And Abimelech is prince over Israel three years,"
7009023,7,9,23,"and God sendeth an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem, and the masters of Shechem deal treacherously with Abimelech,"
7009024,7,9,24,"for the coming in of the violence `to' the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, and of their blood to place `it' on Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and on the masters of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren."
7009025,7,9,25,"And the masters of Shechem set for him ambushes on the top of the hills, and rob every one who passeth over by them in the way, and it is declared to Abimelech."
7009026,7,9,26,"And Gaal son of Ebed cometh -- also his brethren -- and they pass over into Shechem, and the masters of Shechem trust in him,"
7009027,7,9,27,"and go out into the field, and gather their vineyards, and tread, and make praises, and go into the house of their god, and eat and drink, and revile Abimelech."
7009028,7,9,28,"And Gaal son of Ebed saith, `Who `is' Abimelech, and who `is' Shechem, that we serve him? is `he' not son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his commander? Serve ye the men of Hamor father of Shechem, and wherefore do we serve him -- we?"
7009029,7,9,29,"and oh that this people were in my hand -- then I turn Abimelech aside;' and he saith to Abimelech, `Increase thy host, and come out.'"
7009030,7,9,30,"And Zebul, prince of the city, heareth the words of Gaal son of Ebed, and his anger burneth,"
7009031,7,9,31,"and he sendeth messengers unto Abimelech deceitfully, saying, `Lo, Gaal son of Ebed and his brethren are coming into Shechem, and lo, they are fortifying the city against thee;"
7009032,7,9,32,"and, now, rise by night, thou and the people who `are' with thee, and lay wait in the field,"
7009033,7,9,33,"and it hath been, in the morning, about the rising of the sun, thou dost rise early, and hast pushed against the city; and lo, he and the people who `are' with him are going out unto thee -- and thou hast done to him as thy hand doth find.'"
7009034,7,9,34,"And Abimelech riseth, and all the people who `are' with him, by night, and they lay wait against Shechem -- four detachments;"
7009035,7,9,35,"and Gaal son of Ebed goeth out, and standeth at the opening of the gate of the city, and Abimelech riseth -- also the people who `are' with him -- from the ambush,"
7009036,7,9,36,"and Gaal seeth the people, and saith unto Zebul, `Lo, people are coming down from the top of the hills;' and Zebul saith unto him, `The shadow of the hills thou art seeing like men.'"
7009037,7,9,37,"And Gaal addeth yet to speak, and saith, `Lo, people are coming down from the high part of the land, and another detachment is coming by the way of the oak of Meonenim.'"
7009038,7,9,38,"And Zebul saith unto him, `Where `is' now thy mouth, in that thou sayest, Who `is' Abimelech that we serve him? is not this the people against which thou hast kicked? go out, I pray thee now, and fight against it.'"
7009039,7,9,39,"And Gaal goeth out before the masters of Shechem, and fighteth against Abimelech,"
7009040,7,9,40,"and Abimelech pursueth him, and he fleeth from his presence, and many fall wounded -- unto the opening of the gate."
7009041,7,9,41,"And Abimelech abideth in Arumah, and Zebul casteth out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem."
7009042,7,9,42,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the people go out to the field, and they declare `it' to Abimelech,"
7009043,7,9,43,"and he taketh the people, and divideth them into three detachments, and layeth wait in a field, and looketh, and lo, the people are coming out from the city, and he riseth against them, and smiteth them."
7009044,7,9,44,"And Abimelech and the detachments who `are' with him have pushed on, and stand at the opening of the gate of the city, and the two detachments have pushed against all who are in the field, and smite them,"
7009045,7,9,45,"and Abimelech hath fought against the city all that day, and captureth the city, and the people who `are' in it he hath slain, and he breaketh down the city, and soweth it `with' salt."
7009046,7,9,46,"And all the masters of the tower of Shechem hear, and go in unto the high place of the house of the god Berith,"
7009047,7,9,47,"and it is declared to Abimelech that all the masters of the tower of Shechem have gathered themselves together,"
7009048,7,9,48,"and Abimelech goeth up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people who `are' with him, and Abimelech taketh the great axe in his hand, and cutteth off a bough of the trees, and lifteth it up, and setteth `it' on his shoulder, and saith unto the people who `are' with him, `What ye have seen I have done -- haste, do ye like it.'"
7009049,7,9,49,"And all the people also cut down each one his bough, and go after Abimelech, and set `them' at the high place, and burn by these the high place with fire, and also all the men of the tower of Shechem die, about a thousand men and women."
7009050,7,9,50,"And Abimelech goeth unto Thebez, and encampeth against Thebez, and captureth it,"
7009051,7,9,51,"and a strong tower hath been in the midst of the city, and thither flee do all the men and the women, and all the masters of the city, and they shut `it' behind them, and go up on the roof of the tower."
7009052,7,9,52,"And Abimelech cometh unto the tower, and fighteth against it, and draweth nigh unto the opening of the tower to burn it with fire,"
7009053,7,9,53,"and a certain woman doth cast a piece of a rider on the head of Abimelech, and breaketh his skull,"
7009054,7,9,54,"and he calleth hastily unto the young man bearing his weapons, and saith to him, `Draw thy sword, and thou hast put me to death, lest they say of me -- A woman slew him;' and his young man pierced him through, and he dieth."
7009055,7,9,55,"And the men of Israel see that Abimelech `is' dead, and go each one to his place;"
7009056,7,9,56,and God turneth back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father to slay his seventy brethren;
7009057,7,9,57,"and all the evil of the men of Shechem hath God turned back on their head, and come unto them doth the cursing of Jotham son of Jerubbaal."
7010001,7,10,1,"And there riseth after Abimelech, to save Israel, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he is dwelling in Shamir, in the hill-country of Ephraim,"
7010002,7,10,2,"and he judgeth Israel twenty and three years, and he dieth, and is buried in Shamir."
7010003,7,10,3,"And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite, and he judgeth Israel twenty and two years,"
7010004,7,10,4,"and he hath thirty sons riding on thirty ass-colts, and they have thirty cities, (they call them Havoth-Jair unto this day), which `are' in the land of Gilead;"
7010005,7,10,5,"and Jair dieth, and is buried in Kamon."
7010006,7,10,6,"And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the Bene-Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsake Jehovah, and have not served Him;"
7010007,7,10,7,"and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the Bene-Ammon,"
7010008,7,10,8,"and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year -- eighteen years all the sons of Israel `who' are beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, which `is' in Gilead."
7010009,7,10,9,"And the Bene-Ammon pass over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, and Israel hath great distress."
7010010,7,10,10,"And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, saying, `We have sinned against Thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and serve the Baalim.'"
7010011,7,10,11,"And Jehovah saith unto the sons of Israel, ``Have I' not `saved you' from the Egyptians, and from the Amorite, from the Bene-Ammon, and from the Philistines?"
7010012,7,10,12,"And the Zidonians, and Amalek, and Maon have oppressed you, and ye cry unto Me, and I save you out of their hand;"
7010013,7,10,13,"and ye -- ye have forsaken Me, and serve other gods, therefore I add not to save you."
7010014,7,10,14,Go and cry unto the gods on which ye have fixed; they -- they save you in the time of your adversity.'
7010015,7,10,15,"And the sons of Israel say unto Jehovah, `We have sinned, do Thou to us according to all that is good in Thine eyes; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.'"
7010016,7,10,16,"And they turn aside the gods of the stranger out of their midst, and serve Jehovah, and His soul is grieved with the misery of Israel."
7010017,7,10,17,"And the Bene-Ammon are called together, and encamp in Gilead, and the sons of Israel are gathered together, and encamp in Mizpah."
7010018,7,10,18,"And the people -- heads of Gilead -- say one unto another, `Who `is' the man that doth begin to fight against the Bene-Ammon? he is for head to all inhabitants of Gilead.'"
7011001,7,11,1,"And Jephthah the Gileadite hath been a mighty man of valour, and he `is' son of a woman, a harlot; and Gilead begetteth Jephthah,"
7011002,7,11,2,"and the wife of Gilead beareth to him sons, and the wife's sons grow up and cast out Jephthah, and say to him, `Thou dost not inherit in the house of our father; for son of another woman `art' thou.'"
7011003,7,11,3,"And Jephthah fleeth from the face of his brethren, and dwelleth in the land of Tob; and vain men gather themselves together unto Jephthah, and they go out with him."
7011004,7,11,4,"And it cometh to pass, after a time, that the Bene-Ammon fight with Israel,"
7011005,7,11,5,"and it cometh to pass, when the Bene-Ammon have fought with Israel, that the elders of Gilead go to take Jephthah from the land of Tob;"
7011006,7,11,6,"and they say unto Jephthah, `Come, and thou hast been to us for captain, and we fight against the Bene-Ammon.'"
7011007,7,11,7,"And Jephthah saith to the elders of Gilead, `Have not ye hated me? and ye cast me out from the house of my father, and wherefore have ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?'"
7011008,7,11,8,"and the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah, `Therefore, now, we have turned back unto thee; and thou hast gone with us, and fought against the Bene-Ammon, and thou hast been to us for head -- to all the inhabitants of Gilead.'"
7011009,7,11,9,"And Jephthah saith unto the elders of Gilead, `If ye are taking me back to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and Jehovah hath given them before me -- I, am I to you for a head?'"
7011010,7,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah, `Jehovah is hearkening between us -- if according to thy word we do not so.'"
7011011,7,11,11,"And Jephthah goeth with the elders of Gilead, and the people set him over them for head and for captain, and Jephthah speaketh all his words before Jehovah in Mizpeh."
7011012,7,11,12,"And Jephthah sendeth messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon, saying, `What -- to me and to thee, that thou hast come in unto me, to fight in my land.'"
7011013,7,11,13,"And the king of the Bene-Ammon saith unto the messengers of Jephthah, `Because Israel took my land in his coming up out of Egypt, from Arnon, and unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan; and now, restore them in peace.'"
7011014,7,11,14,"And Jephthah addeth yet and sendeth messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon,"
7011015,7,11,15,"and saith to him, `Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not the land of Moab, and the land of the Bene-Ammon,"
7011016,7,11,16,"for in their coming up out of Egypt, Israel goeth in the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and cometh in to Kadesh,"
7011017,7,11,17,"and Israel sendeth messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass over, I pray thee, through thy land, and the king of Edom hearkened not; and also unto the king of Moab hath `Israel' sent, and he hath not been willing; and Israel abideth in Kadesh,"
7011018,7,11,18,"and he goeth through the wilderness, and compasseth the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and cometh in at the rising of the sun of the land of Moab, and they encamp beyond Arnon, and have not come into the border of Moab, for Arnon `is' the border of Moab."
7011019,7,11,19,"`And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon, king of the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and Israel saith to him, Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land, unto my place,"
7011020,7,11,20,"and Sihon hath not trusted Israel to pass over through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and they encamp in Jahaz, and fight with Israel;"
7011021,7,11,21,"and Jehovah, God of Israel, giveth Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smite them, and Israel possesseth all the land of the Amorite, the inhabitant of that land,"
7011022,7,11,22,"and they possess all the border of the Amorite from Arnon, and unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness, and unto the Jordan."
7011023,7,11,23,"`And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorite from the presence of His people Israel, and thou wouldst possess it!"
7011024,7,11,24,"That which Chemosh thy god causeth thee to possess -- dost thou not possess it? and all that which Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from our presence, -- it we do possess."
7011025,7,11,25,"`And now, `art' thou at all better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he at all strive with Israel? did he at all fight against them?"
7011026,7,11,26,"In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and in its towns, and in Aroer and in its towns, and in all the cities which `are' by the sides of Arnon three hundred years -- and wherefore have ye not delivered them in that time?"
7011027,7,11,27,"And I -- I have not sinned against thee, and thou art doing with me evil -- to fight against me. Jehovah, the Judge, doth judge to-day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.'"
7011028,7,11,28,"And the king of the Bene-Ammon hath not hearkened unto the words of Jephthah which he sent unto him,"
7011029,7,11,29,"and the Spirit of Jehovah is on Jephthah, and he passeth over Gilead and Manasseh, and passeth over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he hath passed over to the Bene-Ammon."
7011030,7,11,30,"And Jephthah voweth a vow to Jehovah, and saith, `If Thou dost at all give the Bene-Ammon into my hand --"
7011031,7,11,31,"then it hath been, that which at all cometh out from the doors of my house to meet me in my turning back in peace from the Bene-Ammon -- it hath been to Jehovah, or I have offered up for it -- a burnt-offering.'"
7011032,7,11,32,"And Jephthah passeth over unto the Bene-Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah giveth them into his hand,"
7011033,7,11,33,"and he smiteth them from Aroer, and unto thy going in to Minnith, twenty cities, and unto the meadow of the vineyards -- a very great smiting; and the Bene-Ammon are humbled at the presence of the sons of Israel."
7011034,7,11,34,"And Jephthah cometh into Mizpeh, unto his house, and lo, his daughter is coming out to meet him with timbrels, and with choruses, and save her alone, he hath none, son or daughter."
7011035,7,11,35,"And it cometh to pass, when he seeth her, that he rendeth his garments, and saith, `Alas, my daughter, thou hast caused me greatly to bend, and thou hast been among those troubling me; and I -- I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I am not able to turn back.'"
7011036,7,11,36,"And she saith unto him, `My father -- thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah, do to me as it hath gone out from thy mouth, after that Jehovah hath done for thee vengeance on thine enemies, on the Bene-Ammon.'"
7011037,7,11,37,"And she saith unto her father, `Let this thing be done to me; desist from me two months, and I go on, and have gone down on the hills, and I weep for my virginity -- I and my friends.'"
7011038,7,11,38,"And he saith, `Go;' and he sendeth her away two months, and she goeth, she and her friends, and she weepeth for her virginity on the hills;"
7011039,7,11,39,"and it cometh to pass at the end of two months that she turneth back unto her father, and he doth to her his vow which he hath vowed, and she knew not a man; and it is a statute in Israel:"
7011040,7,11,40,"from time to time the daughters of Israel go to talk to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year."
7012001,7,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim are called together, and pass over northward, and say to Jephthah, `Wherefore has thou passed over to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and on us hast not called to go with thee? thy house we burn over thee with fire.'"
7012002,7,12,2,"And Jephthah saith unto them, `A man of great strife I have been (I and my people) with the Bene-Ammon, and I call you, and ye have not saved me out of their hand,"
7012003,7,12,3,"and I see that thou art not a saviour, and I put my life in my hand, and pass over unto the Bene-Ammon, and Jehovah giveth them into my hand -- and why have ye come up unto me this day to fight against me?'"
7012004,7,12,4,"And Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and fighteth with Ephraim, and the men of Gilead smite Ephraim, because they said, `Fugitives of Ephraim `are' ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim -- in the midst of Manasseh.'"
7012005,7,12,5,"And Gilead captureth the passages of the Jordan to Ephraim, and it hath been, when `any of' the fugitives of Ephraim say, `Let me pass over,' and the men of Gilead say to him, `An Ephramite thou?' and he saith, `No;'"
7012006,7,12,6,"that they say to him, `Say, I pray thee, Shibboleth;' and he saith, `Sibboleth,' and is not prepared to speak right -- and they seize him, and slaughter him at the passages of the Jordan, and there fall at that time, of Ephraim, forty and two chiefs."
7012007,7,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years, and Jephthah the Gileadite dieth, and is buried in `one of' the cities of Gilead."
7012008,7,12,8,"And after him Ibzan of Beth-Lehem judgeth Israel,"
7012009,7,12,9,"and he hath thirty sons and thirty daughters, he hath sent without and thirty daughters hath brought in to his sons from without; and he judgeth Israel seven years."
7012010,7,12,10,"And Ibzan dieth, and is buried in Beth-Lehem."
7012011,7,12,11,"And after him Elon the Zebulunite judgeth Israel, and he judgeth Israel ten years,"
7012012,7,12,12,"and Elon the Zebulunite dieth, and is buried in Aijalon, in the land of Zebulun."
7012013,7,12,13,"And after him, Abdon son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, judgeth Israel,"
7012014,7,12,14,"and he hath forty sons, and thirty grandsons, riding on seventy ass-colts, and he judgeth Israel eight years."
7012015,7,12,15,"And Abdon son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, dieth, and is buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekite."
7013001,7,13,1,"And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of the Philistines forty years."
7013002,7,13,2,"And there is a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danite, and his name `is' Manoah, his wife `is' barren, and hath not borne;"
7013003,7,13,3,"and a messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto the woman, and saith unto her, `Lo, I pray thee, thou `art' barren, and hast not borne; when thou hast conceived, then thou hast borne a son."
7013004,7,13,4,"And, now, take heed, I pray thee, and do not drink wine, and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,"
7013005,7,13,5,"for, lo, thou art conceiving and bearing a son, and a razor doth not go up on his head, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the womb, and he doth begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.'"
7013006,7,13,6,"And the woman cometh and speaketh to her husband, saying, `A man of God hath come unto me, and his appearance `is' as the appearance of a messenger of God, very fearful, and I have not asked him whence he `is', and his name he hath not declared to me;"
7013007,7,13,7,"and he saith to me, Lo, thou art pregnant, and bearing a son, and now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the womb till the day of his death.'"
7013008,7,13,8,"And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah, and saith, `O, my Lord, the man of God whom Thou didst send, let him come in, I pray thee, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth who is born.'"
7013009,7,13,9,"And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah, and the messenger of God cometh again unto the woman, and she `is' sitting in a field, and Manoah her husband is not with her,"
7013010,7,13,10,"and the woman hasteth, and runneth, and declareth to her husband, and saith unto him, `Lo, he hath appeared unto me -- the man who came on `that' day unto me.'"
7013011,7,13,11,"And Manoah riseth, and goeth after his wife, and cometh unto the man, and saith to him, `Art thou the man who spake unto the woman?' and he saith, `I `am'.'"
7013012,7,13,12,"And Manoah saith, `Now let thy words come to pass; what is the custom of the youth -- and his work?'"
7013013,7,13,13,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `Of all that I said unto the woman let her take heed;"
7013014,7,13,14,"of anything which cometh out from the wine-vine she doth not eat, and wine and strong drink she doth not drink, and any unclean thing she doth not eat; all that I have commanded her she doth observe.'"
7013015,7,13,15,"And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `Let us detain thee, we pray thee, and prepare before thee a kid of the goats.'"
7013016,7,13,16,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `If thou detain me -- I do not eat of thy bread; and if thou prepare a burnt-offering -- to Jehovah thou dost offer it;' for Manoah hath not known that He `is' a messenger of Jehovah."
7013017,7,13,17,"And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `What `is' thy name? when thy words come to pass, then we have honoured thee.'"
7013018,7,13,18,"And the messenger of Jehovah saith to him, `Why `is' this -- thou dost ask for My name? -- and it `is' Wonderful.'"
7013019,7,13,19,"And Manoah taketh the kid of the goats, and the present, and offereth on the rock to Jehovah, and He is doing wonderfully, and Manoah and his wife are looking on,"
7013020,7,13,20,"and it cometh to pass, in the going up of the flame from off the altar toward the heavens, that the messenger of Jehovah goeth up in the flame of the altar, and Manoah and his wife are looking on, and they fall on their faces to the earth,"
7013021,7,13,21,"and the messenger of Jehovah hath not added again to appear unto Manoah, and unto his wife, then hath Manoah known that He `is' a messenger of Jehovah."
7013022,7,13,22,"And Manoah saith unto his wife, `We certainly die, for we have seen God.'"
7013023,7,13,23,"And his wife saith to him, `If Jehovah were desirous to put us to death, He had not received from our hands burnt-offering and present, nor shewed us all these things, nor as `at this' time caused us to hear `anything' like this.'"
7013024,7,13,24,"And the woman beareth a son, and calleth his name Samson, and the youth groweth, and Jehovah doth bless him,"
7013025,7,13,25,"and the Spirit of Jehovah beginneth to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
7014001,7,14,1,"And Samson goeth down to Timnath, and seeth a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines,"
7014002,7,14,2,"and cometh up and declareth to his father, and to his mother, and saith, `A woman I have seen in Timnath, of the daughters of the Philistines; and now, take her for me for a wife.'"
7014003,7,14,3,"And his father saith to him -- also his mother, `Is there not among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a woman, that thou art going to take a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?' and Samson saith unto his father, `Take her for me, for she is right in mine eyes.'"
7014004,7,14,4,"And his father and his mother have not known that from Jehovah it `is', that a meeting he is seeking of the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over Israel."
7014005,7,14,5,"And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother, to Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and lo, a lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,"
7014006,7,14,6,"and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he rendeth it as the rending of a kid, and there is nothing in his hand, and he hath not declared to his father and to his mother that which he hath done."
7014007,7,14,7,"And he goeth down and speaketh to the woman, and she is right in the eyes of Samson;"
7014008,7,14,8,"and he turneth back after `some' days to take her, and turneth aside to see the carcase of the lion, and lo, a company of bees `are' in the body of the lion -- and honey."
7014009,7,14,9,"And he taketh it down on to his hands, and goeth on, going and eating; and he goeth unto his father, and unto his mother, and giveth to them, and they eat, and he hath not declared to them that from the body of the lion he took down the honey."
7014010,7,14,10,"And his father goeth down unto the woman, and Samson maketh there a banquet, for so the young men do;"
7014011,7,14,11,"and it cometh to pass when they see him, that they take thirty companions, and they are with him."
7014012,7,14,12,"And Samson saith to them, `Let me, I pray you, put forth to you a riddle; if ye certainly declare it to me `in' the seven days of the banquet, and have found `it' out, then I have given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments;"
7014013,7,14,13,"and if ye are not able to declare `it' to me, then ye have given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments.' And they say to him, `Put forth thy riddle, and we hear it!'"
7014014,7,14,14,"And he saith to them: `Out of the eater came forth meat, And out of the strong came forth sweetness;' and they were not able to declare the riddle `in' three days."
7014015,7,14,15,"And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they say to Samson's wife, `Entice thy husband, that he declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and the house of thy father with fire; to possess us have ye called for us? is it not?'"
7014016,7,14,16,"And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my mother I have not declared `it' -- and to thee I declare `it'!'"
7014017,7,14,17,"And she weepeth for it the seven days `in' which their banquet hath been, and it cometh to pass on the seventh day that he declareth `it' to her, for she hath distressed him; and she declareth the riddle to the sons of her people."
7014018,7,14,18,"And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day, before the sun goeth in: -- `What `is' sweeter than honey? And what stronger than a lion?' And he saith to them: `Unless ye had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'"
7014019,7,14,19,"And the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he goeth down to Ashkelon, and smiteth of them thirty men, and taketh their armour, and giveth the changes to those declaring the riddle; and his anger burneth, and he goeth up to the house of his father;"
7014020,7,14,20,"and Samson's wife becometh his companion's, who `is' his friend."
7015001,7,15,1,"And it cometh to pass, after `some' days, in the days of wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner chamber;' and her father hath not permitted him to go in,"
7015002,7,15,2,"and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her sister -- the young one -- better than she? Let her be, I pray thee, to thee, instead of her.'"
7015003,7,15,3,"And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'"
7015004,7,15,4,"And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch between the two tails, in the midst,"
7015005,7,15,5,"and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth `them' out into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth `it' from heap even unto standing corn, even unto vineyard -- olive-yard."
7015006,7,15,6,"And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire."
7015007,7,15,7,"And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'"
7015008,7,15,8,"And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting, and goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam."
7015009,7,15,9,"And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are spread out in Lehi,"
7015010,7,15,10,"and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against us?' and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.'"
7015011,7,15,11,"And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the Philistines are rulers over us? and what `is' this thou hast done to us?' And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did to them.'"
7015012,7,15,12,"And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down -- to give thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson saith to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.'"
7015013,7,15,13,"And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands, new ones, and bring him up from the rock."
7015014,7,15,14,"He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and the thick bands which `are' on his arms are as flax which they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his hands,"
7015015,7,15,15,"and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it -- a thousand men."
7015016,7,15,16,"And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass -- an ass upon asses -- with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a thousand men.'"
7015017,7,15,17,"And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he casteth away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and calleth that place Ramath-Lehi;"
7015018,7,15,18,"and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'"
7015019,7,15,19,"And God cleaveth the hollow place which `is' in Lehi, and waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh back, and he reviveth; therefore hath `one' called its name `The fountain of him who is calling,' which `is' in Lehi unto this day."
7015020,7,15,20,And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
7016001,7,16,1,"And Samson goeth to Gaza, and seeth there a woman, a harlot, and goeth in unto her;"
7016002,7,16,2,"`it is told' to the Gazathites, saying, `Samson hath come in hither;' and they go round and lay wait for him all the night at the gate of the city, and keep themselves silent all the night, saying, `Till the light of the morning -- then we have slain him.'"
7016003,7,16,3,"And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night, and riseth in the middle of the night, and layeth hold on the doors of the gate of the city, and on the two side posts, and removeth them with the bar, and putteth on his shoulders, and taketh them up unto the top of the hill, which `is' on the front of Hebron."
7016004,7,16,4,"And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in the valley of Sorek, and her name `is' Delilah,"
7016005,7,16,5,"and the princes of the Philistines come up unto her, and say to her, `Entice him, and see wherein his great power `is', and wherein we are able for him -- and we have bound him to afflict him, and we -- we give to thee, each one, eleven hundred silverlings.'"
7016006,7,16,6,"And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Declare, I pray thee, to me, wherein thy great power `is', and wherewith thou art bound, to afflict thee.'"
7016007,7,16,7,"And Samson saith unto her, `If they bind me with seven green withs which have not been dried, then I have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'"
7016008,7,16,8,"And the princes of the Philistines bring up to her seven green withs which have not been dried, and she bindeth him with them."
7016009,7,16,9,"And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber, and she saith unto him, `Philistines `are' upon thee, Samson;' and he breaketh the withs as a thread of tow is broken in its smelling fire, and his power hath not been known."
7016010,7,16,10,"And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Lo, thou hast played upon me, and speakest unto me lies; now, declare, I pray thee, to me, wherewith thou art bound.'"
7016011,7,16,11,"And he saith unto her, `If they certainly bind me with thick bands, new ones, by which work hath not been done, then I have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'"
7016012,7,16,12,"And Delilah taketh thick bands, new ones, and bindeth him with them, and saith unto him, `Philistines `are' upon thee, Samson;' and the ambush is abiding in an inner chamber, and he breaketh them from off his arms as a thread."
7016013,7,16,13,"And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Hitherto thou hast played upon me, and dost speak unto me lies; declare to me wherewith thou art bound.' And he saith unto her, `If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.'"
7016014,7,16,14,"And she fixeth `it' with the pin, and saith unto him, `Philistines `are' upon thee, Samson;' and he awaketh out of his sleep, and journeyeth with the pin of the weaving machine, and with the web."
7016015,7,16,15,"And she saith unto him, `How dost thou say, I have loved thee, and thy heart is not with me? these three times thou hast played upon me, and hast not declared to me wherein thy great power `is'.'"
7016016,7,16,16,"And it cometh to pass, because she distressed him with her words all the days, and doth urge him, and his soul is grieved to death,"
7016017,7,16,17,"that he declareth to her all his heart, and saith to her, `A razor hath not gone up on my head, for a Nazarite to God I `am' from the womb of my mother; if I have been shaven, then hath my power turned aside from me, and I have been weak, and have been as any of the human race.'"
7016018,7,16,18,"And Delilah seeth that he hath declared to her all his heart, and she sendeth and calleth for the princes of the Philistines, saying, `Come up this time, for he hath declared to me all his heart;' and the princes of the Philistines have come up unto her, and bring up the money in their hand."
7016019,7,16,19,"and she maketh him sleep on her knees, and calleth for a man, and shaveth the seven locks of his head, and beginneth to afflict him, and his power turneth aside from off him;"
7016020,7,16,20,"and she saith, `Philistines `are' upon thee, Samson;' and he awaketh out of his sleep, and saith, `I go out as time by time, and shake myself;' and he hath not known that Jehovah hath turned aside from off him."
7016021,7,16,21,"And the Philistines seize him, and pick out his eyes, and bring him down to Gaza, and bind him with two brazen fetters; and he is grinding in the prison-house."
7016022,7,16,22,"And the hair of his head beginneth to shoot up, when he hath been shaven,"
7016023,7,16,23,"and the princes of the Philistines have been gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; and they say, `Our god hath given into our hand Samson our enemy.'"
7016024,7,16,24,"And the people see him, and praise their god, for they said, `Our god hath given in our hand our enemy, and he who is laying waste our land, and who multiplied our wounded.'"
7016025,7,16,25,"And it cometh to pass, when their heart `is' glad, that they say, `Call for Samson, and he doth play before us;' and they call for Samson out of the prison-house, and he playeth before them, and they cause him to stand between the pillars."
7016026,7,16,26,"And Samson saith unto the young man who is keeping hold on his hand, `Let me alone, and let me feel the pillars on which the house is established, and I lean upon them.'"
7016027,7,16,27,"And the house hath been full of men and of women, and thither `are' all the princes of the Philistines, and on the roof `are' about three thousand men and women, who are looking on the playing of Samson."
7016028,7,16,28,"And Samson calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this time, O God; and I am avenged -- vengeance at once -- because of my two eyes, on the Philistines.'"
7016029,7,16,29,"And Samson turneth aside `to' the two middle pillars, on which the house is established, and on which it is supported, `to' the one with his right hand, and one with his left;"
7016030,7,16,30,"and Samson saith, `Let me die with the Philistines,' and he inclineth himself powerfully, and the house falleth on the princes, and on all the people who `are' in it, and the dead whom he hath put to death in his death are more than those whom he put to death in his life."
7016031,7,16,31,"And his brethren come down, and all the house of his father, and lift him up, and bring him up, and bury him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the burying-place of Manoah his father; and he hath judged Israel twenty years."
7017001,7,17,1,"And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name `is' Micah,"
7017002,7,17,2,"and he saith to his mother, `The eleven hundred silverlings which have been taken of thine, and `of which' thou hast sworn, and also spoken in mine ears; lo, the silver `is' with me, I have taken it;' and his mother saith, `Blessed `is' my son of Jehovah.'"
7017003,7,17,3,"And he giveth back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother, and his mother saith, `I had certainly sanctified the silver to Jehovah, from my hand, for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; and now, I give it back to thee.'"
7017004,7,17,4,"And he giveth back the money to his mother, and his mother taketh two hundred silverlings, and giveth them to a refiner, and he maketh them a graven image, and a molten image, and it is in the house of Micah."
7017005,7,17,5,"As to the man Micah, he hath a house of gods, and he maketh an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrateth the hand of one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest;"
7017006,7,17,6,"in those days there is no king in Israel, each that which is right in his own eyes doth."
7017007,7,17,7,"And there is a young man of Beth-Lehem-Judah, of the family of Judah, and he `is' a Levite, and he `is' a sojourner there."
7017008,7,17,8,"And the man goeth out of the city, out of Beth-Lehem-Judah, to sojourn where he doth find, and cometh to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, to work his way."
7017009,7,17,9,"And Micah saith to him, `Whence comest thou?' and he saith unto him, `A Levite `am' I, of Beth-Lehem-Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I do find.'"
7017010,7,17,10,"And Micah saith to him, `Dwell with me, and be to me for a father and for a priest, and I give to thee ten silverlings for the days, and a suit of garments, and thy sustenance;' and the Levite goeth `in'."
7017011,7,17,11,"And the Levite is willing to dwell with the man, and the young man is to him as one of his sons."
7017012,7,17,12,"And Micah consecrateth the hand of the Levite, and the young man is to him for a priest, and he is in the house of Micah,"
7017013,7,17,13,"and Micah saith, `Now I have known that Jehovah doth good to me, for the Levite hath been to me for a priest.'"
7018001,7,18,1,"In those days there is no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Danite is seeking for itself an inheritance to inhabit, for `that' hath not fallen to it unto that day in the midst of the tribes of Israel by inheritance."
7018002,7,18,2,"And the sons of Dan send, out of their family, five men of them, men, sons of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to traverse the land, and to search it, and they say unto them, `Go, search the land;' and they come into the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodge there."
7018003,7,18,3,"They `are' with the household of Micah, and they have discerned the voice of the young man, the Levite, and turn aside there, and say to him, `Who hath brought thee hither? and what art thou doing in this `place?' and what to thee here?'"
7018004,7,18,4,"And he saith unto them, `Thus and thus hath Micah done to me; and he hireth me, and I am to him for a priest.'"
7018005,7,18,5,"And they say to him, `Ask, we pray thee, at God, and we know whether our way is prosperous on which we are going.'"
7018006,7,18,6,"And the priest saith to them, `Go in peace; over-against Jehovah `is' your way in which ye go.'"
7018007,7,18,7,"And the five men go, and come in to Laish, and see the people which `is' in its midst, dwelling confidently, according to the custom of Zidonians, quiet and confident; and there is none putting to shame in the land in `any' thing, possessing restraint, and they `are' far off from the Zidonians, and have no word with `any' man."
7018008,7,18,8,"And they come in unto their brethren, at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren say to them, `What -- ye?'"
7018009,7,18,9,"And they say, `Rise, and we go up against them, for we have seen the land, and lo, very good; and ye are keeping silent! be not slothful to go -- to enter to possess the land."
7018010,7,18,10,"When ye go, ye come in unto a people confident, and the land `is' large on both hands, for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything which `is' in the land.'"
7018011,7,18,11,"And there journey thence, of the family of the Danite, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war."
7018012,7,18,12,"And they go up and encamp in Kirjath-Jearim, in Judah, therefore they have called that place, `Camp of Dan,' till this day; lo, behind Kirjath-Jearim."
7018013,7,18,13,"And they pass over thence `to' the hill-country of Ephraim, and come in unto the house of Micah."
7018014,7,18,14,"And the five men, those going to traverse the land of Laish, answer and say unto their brethren, `Have ye known that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and graven image, and molten image? and now, know what ye do.'"
7018015,7,18,15,"And they turn aside thither, and come in unto the house of the young man the Levite, the house of Micah, and ask of him of welfare, --"
7018016,7,18,16,"(and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who `are' of the sons of Dan, are standing at the opening of the gate), --"
7018017,7,18,17,"yea, the five men, those going to traverse the land, go up -- they have come in thither -- they have taken the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image -- and the priest is standing at the opening of the gate, and the six hundred men who are girded with weapons of war --"
7018018,7,18,18,"yea, these have entered the house of Micah, and take the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest saith unto them, `What are ye doing?'"
7018019,7,18,19,"and they say to him, `Keep silent, lay thy hand on thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us for a father and for a priest: is it better thy being a priest to the house of one man, or thy being priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?'"
7018020,7,18,20,"And the heart of the priest is glad, and he taketh the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and goeth into the midst of the people,"
7018021,7,18,21,"and they turn and go, and put the infants, and the cattle, and the baggage, before them."
7018022,7,18,22,"They have been far off from the house of Micah -- and the men who `are' in the houses which `are' near the house of Micah have been called together, and overtake the sons of Dan,"
7018023,7,18,23,"and call unto the sons of Dan, and they turn round their faces, and say to Micah, `What -- to thee that thou hast been called together?'"
7018024,7,18,24,"And he saith, `My gods which I made ye have taken, and the priest, and ye go; and what to me more? and what `is' this ye say unto me, What -- to thee!'"
7018025,7,18,25,"And the sons of Dan say unto him, `Let not thy voice be heard with us, lest men bitter in soul fall upon you, and thou hast gathered thy life, and the life of thy household;'"
7018026,7,18,26,"and the sons of Dan go on their way, and Micah seeth that they are stronger than he, and turneth, and goeth back unto his house."
7018027,7,18,27,"And they have taken that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and come in against Laish, against a people quiet and confident, and smite them by the mouth of the sword, and the city have burnt with fire,"
7018028,7,18,28,"and there is no deliverer, for it `is' far off from Zidon, and they have no word with `any' man, and it `is' in the valley which `is' by Beth-Rehob; and they build the city, and dwell in it,"
7018029,7,18,29,"and call the name of the city Dan, by the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and yet Laish `is' the name of the city at the first."
7018030,7,18,30,"And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day of the removal of `the people' of the land."
7018031,7,18,31,"And they appoint for them the graven image of Micah, which he had made, all the days of the house of God being in Shiloh."
7019001,7,19,1,"And it cometh to pass, in those days, when there is no king in Israel, that there is a man a Levite, a sojourner in the sides of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he taketh to him a wife, a concubine, out of Beth-Lehem-Judah;"
7019002,7,19,2,"and commit whoredom against him doth his concubine, and she goeth from him unto the house of her father, unto Beth-Lehem-Judah, and is there days -- four months."
7019003,7,19,3,"And her husband riseth and goeth after her, to speak unto her heart, to bring her back, and his young man `is' with him, and a couple of asses; and she bringeth him into the house of her father, and the father of the young woman seeth him, and rejoiceth to meet him."
7019004,7,19,4,"And keep hold on him doth his father-in-law, father of the young woman, and he abideth with him three days, and they eat and drink, and lodge there."
7019005,7,19,5,"And it cometh to pass, on the fourth day, that they rise early in the morning, and he riseth to go, and the father of the young woman saith unto his son-in-law, `Support thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye go on.'"
7019006,7,19,6,"And they sit and eat both of them together, and drink, and the father of the young woman saith unto the man, `Be willing, I pray thee, and lodge all night, and let thy heart be glad.'"
7019007,7,19,7,"And the man riseth to go, and his father-in-law presseth on him, and he turneth back and lodgeth there."
7019008,7,19,8,"And he riseth early in the morning, on the fifth day, to go, and the father of the young woman saith, `Support, I pray thee, thy heart;' and they have tarried till the turning of the day, and they eat, both of them."
7019009,7,19,9,"And the man riseth to go, he and his concubine, and his young man, and his father-in-law, father of the young woman, saith to him, `Lo, I pray thee, the day hath fallen toward evening, lodge all night, I pray thee; lo, the declining of the day! lodge here, and let thine heart be glad -- and ye have risen early to-morrow for your journey, and thou hast gone to thy tent.'"
7019010,7,19,10,"And the man hath not been willing to lodge all night, and he riseth, and goeth, and cometh in till over-against Jebus (It `is' Jerusalem), and with him `are' a couple of asses saddled; and his concubine `is' with him."
7019011,7,19,11,"They `are' near Jebus, and the day hath gone greatly down, and the young man saith unto his lord, `Come, I pray thee, and we turn aside unto this city of the Jebusite, and lodge in it.'"
7019012,7,19,12,"And his lord saith unto him, `Let us not turn aside unto the city of a stranger, that is not of the sons of Israel, thither, but we have passed over unto Gibeah.'"
7019013,7,19,13,"And he saith to his young man, `Come, and we draw near to one of the places, and have lodged in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'"
7019014,7,19,14,"And they pass over, and go on, and the sun goeth in upon them near Gibeah, which is to Benjamin;"
7019015,7,19,15,"and they turn aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah, and he goeth in and sitteth in a broad place of the city, and there is no man gathering them into the house to lodge."
7019016,7,19,16,"And lo, a man, an aged one, hath come from his work from the field in the evening, and the man `is' of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he `is' a sojourner in Gibeah, and the men of the place `are' Benjamites."
7019017,7,19,17,"And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the man, the traveller, in a broad place of the city, and the aged man saith, `Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?'"
7019018,7,19,18,"And he saith unto him, `We are passing over from Beth-Lehem-Judah unto the sides of the hill-country of Ephraim -- thence I `am', and I go unto Beth-Lehem-Judah; and to the house of Jehovah I am going, and there is no man gathering me into the house,"
7019019,7,19,19,"and both straw and provender are for our asses, and also bread and wine there are for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man with thy servants; there is no lack of anything.'"
7019020,7,19,20,"And the old man saith, `Peace to thee; only, all thy lack `is' on me, only in the broad place lodge not.'"
7019021,7,19,21,"And he bringeth him in to his house, and mixeth `food' for the asses, and they wash their feet, and eat and drink."
7019022,7,19,22,"They are making their heart glad, and lo, men of the city, men -- sons of worthlessness -- have gone round about the house, beating on the door, and they speak unto the old man, the master of the house, saying, `Bring out the man who hath come unto thine house, and we know him.'"
7019023,7,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, goeth out unto them, and saith unto them, `Nay, my brethren, do not evil, I pray you, after that this man hath come in unto my house, do not this folly;"
7019024,7,19,24,"lo, my daughter, the virgin, and his concubine, let me bring them out, I pray you, and humble ye them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes, and to this man do not this foolish thing.'"
7019025,7,19,25,"And the men have not been willing to hearken to him, and the man taketh hold on his concubine, and bringeth `her' out unto them without, and they know her, and roll themselves upon her all the night, till the morning, and send her away in the ascending of the dawn;"
7019026,7,19,26,"and the woman cometh in at the turning of the morning, and falleth at the opening of the man's house, where her lord `is', till the light."
7019027,7,19,27,"And her lord riseth in the morning, and openeth the doors of the house, and goeth out to go on his way, and lo, the woman, his concubine, is fallen at the opening of the house, and her hands `are' on the threshold,"
7019028,7,19,28,"and he saith unto her, `Rise, and we go;' and there is none answering, and he taketh her on the ass, and the man riseth and goeth to his place,"
7019029,7,19,29,"and cometh in unto his house, and taketh the knife, and layeth hold on his concubine, and cutteth her in pieces to her bones -- into twelve pieces, and sendeth her into all the border of Israel."
7019030,7,19,30,"And it hath come to pass, every one who seeth hath said, `There hath not been -- yea, there hath not been seen like this, from the day of the coming up of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt till this day; set your `heart' upon it, take counsel, and speak.'"
7020001,7,20,1,"And all the sons of Israel go out, and the company is assembled as one man, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, and the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah, at Mizpeh."
7020002,7,20,2,"And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, station themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen drawing sword."
7020003,7,20,3,"And the sons of Benjamin hear that the sons of Israel have gone up to Mizpeh. And the sons of Israel say, `Speak ye, how hath this evil been?'"
7020004,7,20,4,"And the man, the Levite, husband of the woman who hath been murdered, answereth and saith, `Into Gibeah (which `is' to Benjamin) I have come, I and my concubine, to lodge;"
7020005,7,20,5,"and rise against me do the masters of Gibeah -- and they go round the house against me by night -- me they thought to slay, and my concubine they have humbled, and she dieth;"
7020006,7,20,6,"and I lay hold on my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and send her into all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have done wickedness and folly in Israel;"
7020007,7,20,7,"lo, ye `are' all sons of Israel; give for you a word and counsel here.'"
7020008,7,20,8,"And all the people rise as one man, saying, `None of us doth go to his tent, and none of us doth turn aside to his house;"
7020009,7,20,9,"and now, this `is' the thing which we do to Gibeah -- against it by lot!"
7020010,7,20,10,"and we have taken ten men of a hundred, of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of a myriad, to receive provision for the people, to do, at their coming to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly which it hath done in Israel.'"
7020011,7,20,11,"And every man of Israel is gathered unto the city, as one man -- companions."
7020012,7,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel send men among all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, `What `is' this evil which hath been among you?"
7020013,7,20,13,"And now, give up the men -- sons of worthlessness -- which `are' in Gibeah, and we put them to death, and we put away evil from Israel.' And `the sons of' Benjamin have not been willing to hearken to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel;"
7020014,7,20,14,"and the sons of Benjamin are gathered out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle with the sons of Israel."
7020015,7,20,15,"And the sons of Benjamin number themselves on that day; out of the cities `are' twenty and six thousand men drawing sword, apart from the inhabitants of Gibeah, `who' numbered themselves, seven hundred chosen men;"
7020016,7,20,16,"among all this people `are' seven hundred chosen men, bound of their right hand, each of these slinging with a stone at the hair, and he doth not err."
7020017,7,20,17,"And the men of Israel numbered themselves, apart from Benjamin, four hundred thousand men, drawing sword, each of these a man of war."
7020018,7,20,18,"And they rise and go up to Beth-El, and ask of God, and the sons of Israel say, `Who doth go up for us at the commencement to battle with the sons of Benjamin?' and Jehovah saith, `Judah -- at the commencement.'"
7020019,7,20,19,"And the sons of Israel rise in the morning, and encamp against Gibeah,"
7020020,7,20,20,"and the men of Israel go out to battle with Benjamin, and the men of Israel set themselves in array with them, `for' battle against Gibeah,"
7020021,7,20,21,"and the sons of Benjamin come out from Gibeah, and destroy in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men -- to the earth."
7020022,7,20,22,"And the people, the men of Israel, strengthen themselves, and add to set the battle in array in the place where they arranged themselves on the first day."
7020023,7,20,23,"And the sons of Israel go up and weep before Jehovah till the evening, and ask of Jehovah, saying, `Do I add to draw nigh to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother?' And Jehovah saith, `Go up against him.'"
7020024,7,20,24,"And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin on the second day,"
7020025,7,20,25,"and Benjamin cometh out to meet them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroy among the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men -- to the earth; all these are drawing sword."
7020026,7,20,26,"And all the sons of Israel go up, even all the people, and come in to Beth-El, and weep, and sit there before Jehovah, and fast on that day till the evening, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah."
7020027,7,20,27,"And the sons of Israel ask of Jehovah, -- and there `is' the ark of the covenant of God in those days,"
7020028,7,20,28,"and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, is standing before it in those days -- saying, `Do I add again to go out to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother, or do I cease?' And Jehovah saith, `Go up, for to-morrow I give him into thy hand.'"
7020029,7,20,29,"And Israel setteth liers in wait against Gibeah, round about,"
7020030,7,20,30,"and the sons of Israel go up against the sons of Benjamin, on the third day, and arrange themselves against Gibeah, as time by time."
7020031,7,20,31,"And the sons of Benjamin come out to meet the people; they have been drawn away out of the city, and begin to smite `some' of the people -- wounded as time by time, in the highways (of which one is going up to Beth-El, and the other to Gibeah in the field), `are' about thirty men of Israel."
7020032,7,20,32,"And the sons of Benjamin say, `They are smitten before us as at the beginning;' but the sons of Israel said, `Let us flee, and draw them away out of the city, unto the highways.'"
7020033,7,20,33,"And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah."
7020034,7,20,34,"And they come in over against Gibeah -- ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel -- and the battle `is' grievous, and they have not known that the evil is striking against them."
7020035,7,20,35,"And Jehovah smiteth Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroy in Benjamin, on that day, twenty and five thousand, and a hundred men; all these `are' drawing sword."
7020036,7,20,36,"And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been smitten -- and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin, for they have trusted unto the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,"
7020037,7,20,37,"and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the city by the mouth of the sword."
7020038,7,20,38,And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with the ambush -- their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from the city.
7020039,7,20,39,"And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin hath begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, `Surely they are utterly smitten before us, as `at' the first battle;"
7020040,7,20,40,"and the volume hath begun to go up from the city -- a pillar of smoke -- and Benjamin turneth behind, and lo, gone up hath the perfection of the city toward the heavens."
7020041,7,20,41,"And the men of Israel have turned, and the men of Benjamin are troubled, for they have seen that the evil hath stricken against them --"
7020042,7,20,42,"and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness, and the battle hath followed them; and those who `are' from the city are destroying them in their midst;"
7020043,7,20,43,"they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah, at the sun-rising."
7020044,7,20,44,And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men -- the whole of these `are' men of valour;
7020045,7,20,45,"and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of them two thousand men."
7020046,7,20,46,"And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five thousand men drawing sword, on that day -- the whole of these `are' men of valour;"
7020047,7,20,47,"and there turn and flee into the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon six hundred men, and they dwell in the rock Rimmon four months."
7020048,7,20,48,"And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the city, -- men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the cities which are found they have sent into fire."
7021001,7,21,1,"And the men of Israel have sworn in Mizpeh, saying, `None of us doth give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.'"
7021002,7,21,2,"And the people come in to Beth-El, and sit there till the evening before God, and lift up their voice, and weep -- a great weeping,"
7021003,7,21,3,"and say, `Why, O Jehovah, God of Israel, hath this been in Israel -- to be lacking to-day, from Israel, one tribe?'"
7021004,7,21,4,"And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that the people rise early, and build there an altar, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings."
7021005,7,21,5,"And the sons of Israel say, `Who `is' he that hath not come up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto Jehovah?' for the great oath hath been concerning him who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, `He is surely put to death.'"
7021006,7,21,6,"And the sons of Israel repent concerning Benjamin their brother, and say, `There hath been to-day cut off one tribe from Israel,"
7021007,7,21,7,"what do we do for them -- for those who are left -- for wives, and we -- we have sworn by Jehovah not to give to them of our daughters for wives?'"
7021008,7,21,8,"And they say, `Who is `that' one out of the tribes of Israel who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh?' and lo, none hath come in unto the camp from Jabesh-Gilead -- unto the assembly."
7021009,7,21,9,"And the people numbered themselves, and lo, there is not there a man of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead."
7021010,7,21,10,"And the company send there twelve thousand men of the sons of valour, and command them, saying, `Go -- and ye have smitten the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead by the mouth of the sword, even the women and the infants."
7021011,7,21,11,"And this `is' the thing which ye do; every male, and every woman knowing the lying of a male, ye devote.'"
7021012,7,21,12,"And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women, virgins, who have not known man by the lying of a male, and they bring them in unto the camp at Shiloh, which `is' in the land of Canaan."
7021013,7,21,13,"And all the company send, and speak, unto the sons of Benjamin who `are' in the rock Rimmon, and proclaim to them peace;"
7021014,7,21,14,"and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for `all of' them so."
7021015,7,21,15,"And the people repented concerning Benjamin, for Jehovah had made a breach among the tribes of Israel."
7021016,7,21,16,"And the elders of the company say, `What do we do to the remnant for wives -- for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?'"
7021017,7,21,17,"And they say, `A possession of an escaped party `is' to Benjamin, and a tribe is not blotted out from Israel;"
7021018,7,21,18,"and we -- we are not able to give to them wives out of our daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed `is' he who is giving a wife to Benjamin.'"
7021019,7,21,19,"And they say, `Lo, a festival of Jehovah `is' in Shiloh, from time to time, which `is' on the north of Beth-El, at the rising of the sun, by the highway which is going up from Beth-El to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.'"
7021020,7,21,20,"And they command the sons of Benjamin, saying, `Go -- and ye have laid wait in the vineyards,"
7021021,7,21,21,"and have seen, and lo, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances -- then ye have gone out from the vineyards, and caught for you each his wife out of the daughters of Shiloh, and gone to the land of Benjamin;"
7021022,7,21,22,"and it hath been, when their fathers or their brethren come in to plead unto us, that we have said unto them, Favour us `by' them, for we have not taken `to' each his wife in battle, for ye -- ye have not given to them at this time `that' ye are guilty.'"
7021023,7,21,23,"And the sons of Benjamin do so, and take women according to their number, out of the dancers whom they have taken violently away; and they go, and turn back unto their inheritance, and build the cities, and dwell in them."
7021024,7,21,24,"And the sons of Israel go up and down thence at that time, each to his tribe, and to his family; and they go out thence each to his inheritance."
7021025,7,21,25,In those days there is no king in Israel; each doth that which is right in his own eyes.
8001001,8,1,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the days of the judging of the judges, that there is a famine in the land, and there goeth a man from Beth-Lehem-Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8001002,8,1,2,"And the name of the man `is' Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Beth-Lehem-Judah; and they come into the fields of Moab, and are there."
8001003,8,1,3,"And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth, and she is left, she and her two sons;"
8001004,8,1,4,"and they take to them wives, Moabitesses: the name of the one `is' Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwell there about ten years."
8001005,8,1,5,"And they die also, both of them -- Mahlon and Chilion -- and the woman is left of her two children and of her husband."
8001006,8,1,6,"And she riseth, she and her daughters-in-law, and turneth back from the fields of Moab, for she hath heard in the fields of Moab that God hath looked after His people, -- to give to them bread."
8001007,8,1,7,"And she goeth out from the place where she hath been, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they go in the way to turn back unto the land of Judah."
8001008,8,1,8,"And Naomi saith to her two daughters-in-law, `Go, turn back, each to the house of her mother; Jehovah doth with you kindness as ye have done with the dead, and with me;"
8001009,8,1,9,"Jehovah doth grant to you, and find ye rest each in the house of her husband;' and she kisseth them, and they lift up their voice and weep."
8001010,8,1,10,"And they say to her, `Surely with thee we go back to thy people.'"
8001011,8,1,11,"And Naomi saith, `Turn back, my daughters; why do ye go with me? are there yet to me sons in my bowels that they have been to you for husbands?"
8001012,8,1,12,"Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too aged to be to a husband; though I had said, There is for me hope, also, I have been to-night to a husband, and also I have borne sons:"
8001013,8,1,13,"for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye shut yourselves up, not to be to a husband? nay, my daughters, for more bitter to me than to you, for the hand of Jehovah hath gone out against me.'"
8001014,8,1,14,"And they lift up their voice, and weep again, and Orpah kisseth her mother-in-law, and Ruth hath cleaved to her."
8001015,8,1,15,"And she saith, `Lo, thy sister-in-law hath turned back unto her people, and unto her god, turn thou back after thy sister-in-law.'"
8001016,8,1,16,"And Ruth saith, `Urge me not to leave thee -- to turn back from after thee; for whither thou goest I go, and where thou lodgest I lodge; thy people `is' my people, and thy God my God."
8001017,8,1,17,"Where thou diest I die, and there I am buried; thus doth Jehovah to me, and thus doth He add -- for death itself doth part between me and thee.'"
8001018,8,1,18,"And she seeth that she is strengthening herself to go with her, and she ceaseth to speak unto her;"
8001019,8,1,19,"and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem; and it cometh to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem, that all the city is moved at them, and they say, `Is this Naomi?'"
8001020,8,1,20,"And she saith unto them, `Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly to me,"
8001021,8,1,21,"I went out full, and empty hath Jehovah brought me back, why do ye call me Naomi, and Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath done evil to me?'"
8001022,8,1,22,"And Naomi turneth back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who hath turned back from the fields of Moab, and they have come in to Beth-Lehem at the commencement of barley-harvest."
8002001,8,2,1,"And Naomi hath an acquaintance of her husband's, a man mighty in wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name `is' Boaz."
8002002,8,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess saith unto Naomi, `Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and I gather among the ears of corn after him in whose eyes I find grace;' and she saith to her, `Go, my daughter.'"
8002003,8,2,3,"And she goeth and cometh and gathereth in a field after the reapers, and her chance happeneth -- the portion of the field is Boaz's who `is' of the family of Elimelech."
8002004,8,2,4,"And lo, Boaz hath come from Beth-Lehem, and saith to the reapers, `Jehovah `is' with you;' and they say to him, `Jehovah doth bless thee.'"
8002005,8,2,5,"And Boaz saith to his young man who is set over the reapers, `Whose `is' this young person?'"
8002006,8,2,6,"And the young man who is set over the reapers answereth and saith, `A young woman -- Moabitess -- she `is', who came back with Naomi from the fields of Moab,"
8002007,8,2,7,"and she saith, Let me glean, I pray thee -- and I have gathered among the sheaves after the reapers; and she cometh and remaineth since the morning and till now; she sat in the house a little."
8002008,8,2,8,"And Boaz saith unto Ruth, `Hast thou not heard, my daughter? go not to glean in another field, and also, pass not over from this, and thus thou dost cleave to my young women:"
8002009,8,2,9,"thine eyes `are' on the field which they reap, and thou hast gone after them; have not I charged the young men not to touch thee? when thou art athirst then thou hast gone unto the vessels, and hast drunk from that which the young men draw.'"
8002010,8,2,10,"And she falleth on her face, and boweth herself to the earth, and saith unto him, `Wherefore have I found grace in thine eyes, to discern me, and I a stranger?'"
8002011,8,2,11,"And Boaz answereth and saith to her, `It hath thoroughly been declared to me all that thou hast done with thy mother-in-law, after the death of thy husband, and thou dost leave thy father, and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and dost come in unto a people which thou hast not known heretofore."
8002012,8,2,12,"Jehovah doth recompense thy work, and thy reward is complete from Jehovah, God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to take refuge.'"
8002013,8,2,13,"And she saith, `Let me find grace in thine eyes, my lord, because thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken unto the heart of thy maid-servant, and I -- I am not as one of thy maid-servants.'"
8002014,8,2,14,"And Boaz saith to her, `At meal-time come nigh hither, and thou hast eaten of the bread, and dipped thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sitteth at the side of the reapers, and he reacheth to her roasted corn, and she eateth, and is satisfied, and leaveth."
8002015,8,2,15,"And she riseth to glean, and Boaz chargeth his young men, saying, `Even between the sheaves she doth glean, and ye do not cause her to blush;"
8002016,8,2,16,"and also ye do surely cast to her of the handfuls -- and have left, and she hath gleaned, and ye do not push against her.'"
8002017,8,2,17,"And she gleaneth in the field till the evening, and beateth out that which she hath gleaned, and it is about an ephah of barley;"
8002018,8,2,18,"and she taketh `it' up, and goeth into the city, and her mother-in-law seeth that which she hath gleaned, and she bringeth out and giveth to her that which she left from her satiety."
8002019,8,2,19,"And her mother-in-law saith to her, `Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? may he who is discerning thee be blessed.' And she declareth to her mother-in-law with whom she hath wrought, and saith, `The name of the man with whom I have wrought to-day `is' Boaz.'"
8002020,8,2,20,"And Naomi saith to her daughter-in-law, `Blessed `is' he of Jehovah who hath not forsaken His kindness with the living and with the dead;' and Naomi saith to her, `The man is a relation of ours; he `is' of our redeemers.'"
8002021,8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess saith, `Also he surely said unto me, Near the young people whom I have thou dost cleave till they have completed the whole of the harvest which I have.'"
8002022,8,2,22,"And Naomi saith unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, `Good, my daughter, that thou goest out with his young women, and they come not against thee in another field.'"
8002023,8,2,23,"And she cleaveth to the young women of Boaz to glean, till the completion of the barley-harvest, and of the wheat-harvest, and she dwelleth with her mother-in-law."
8003001,8,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law saith to her, `My daughter, do not I seek for thee rest, that it may be well with thee?"
8003002,8,3,2,"and now, is not Boaz of our acquaintance, with whose young women thou hast been? lo, he is winnowing the threshing-floor of barley to-night,"
8003003,8,3,3,"and thou hast bathed, and anointed thyself, and put thy garments upon thee, and gone down to the threshing-floor; let not thyself be known to the man till he complete to eat and to drink;"
8003004,8,3,4,"and it cometh to pass when he lieth down, that thou hast known the place where he lieth down, and hast gone in, and uncovered his feet, and lain down, -- and he doth declare to thee that which thou dost do.'"
8003005,8,3,5,"And she saith unto her, `All that thou sayest -- I do.'"
8003006,8,3,6,"And she goeth down `to' the threshing-floor, and doth according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her"
8003007,8,3,7,"And Boaz eateth and drinketh, and his heart is glad; and he goeth in to lie down at the end of the heap; and she cometh in gently, and uncovereth his feet, and lieth down."
8003008,8,3,8,"And it cometh to pass, at the middle of the night, that the man trembleth, and turneth himself, and lo, a woman is lying at his feet."
8003009,8,3,9,"And he saith, `Who `art' thou?' and she saith, `I `am' Ruth thy handmaid, and thou hast spread thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou `art' a redeemer.'"
8003010,8,3,10,"And he saith, `Blessed `art' thou of Jehovah, my daughter; thou hast dealt more kindly at the latter end than at the beginning -- not to go after the young men, either poor or rich."
8003011,8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not, all that thou sayest I do to thee, for all the gate of my people doth know that thou `art' a virtuous woman."
8003012,8,3,12,"And now, surely, true, that I `am' a redeemer, but also there is a redeemer nearer than I."
8003013,8,3,13,"Lodge to night, and it hath been in the morning, if he doth redeem thee, well: he redeemeth; and if he delight not to redeem thee, then I have redeemed thee -- I; Jehovah liveth! lie down till the morning.'"
8003014,8,3,14,"And she lieth down at his feet till the morning, and riseth before one doth discern another; and he saith, `Let it not be known that the woman hath come into the floor.'"
8003015,8,3,15,"And he saith, `Give the covering which `is' on thee, and keep hold on it;' and she keepeth hold on it, and he measureth six `measures' of barley, and layeth `it' on her; and he goeth into the city."
8003016,8,3,16,"And she cometh in unto her mother-in-law, and she saith, `Who `art' thou, my daughter?' and she declareth to her all that the man hath done to her."
8003017,8,3,17,"And she saith, `These six `measures' of barley he hath given to me, for he said, Thou dost not go in empty unto thy mother-in-law.'"
8003018,8,3,18,"And she saith, `Sit still, my daughter, till thou dost know how the matter falleth, for the man doth not rest except he hath completed the matter to-day.'"
8004001,8,4,1,"And Boaz hath gone up to the gate, and sitteth there, and lo, the redeemer is passing by of whom Boaz had spoken, and he saith, `Turn aside, sit down here, such a one, such a one;' and he turneth aside and sitteth down."
8004002,8,4,2,"And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city, and saith, `Sit down here;' and they sit down."
8004003,8,4,3,"And he saith to the redeemer, `A portion of the field which `is' to our brother, to Elimelech, hath Naomi sold, who hath come back from the fields of Moab;"
8004004,8,4,4,"and I said, I uncover thine ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people; if thou dost redeem -- redeem, and if none doth redeem -- declare to me, and I know, for there is none save thee to redeem, and I after thee.' And he saith, I redeem `it'.'"
8004005,8,4,5,"And Boaz saith, `In the day of thy buying the field from the hand of Naomi, then from Ruth the Moabitess, wife of the dead, thou hast bought `it', to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance.'"
8004006,8,4,6,"And the redeemer saith, `I am not able to redeem `it' for myself, lest I destroy mine inheritance; redeem for thyself -- thou -- my right of redemption, for I am not able to redeem.'"
8004007,8,4,7,"And this `is' formerly in Israel for redemption and for changing, to establish anything: a man hath drawn off his sandal, and given `it' to his neighbour, and this `is' the testimony in Israel."
8004008,8,4,8,"And the redeemer saith to Boaz, `Buy `it' for thyself,' and draweth off his sandal."
8004009,8,4,9,"And Boaz saith to the elders, and `to' all the people, `Witnesses `are' ye to-day that I have bought all that `is' to Elimelech, and all that `is' to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi;"
8004010,8,4,10,"and also Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, I have bought to myself for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance; and the name of the dead is not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; witnesses ye `are' to-day.'"
8004011,8,4,11,"And all the people who `are' in the gate say -- also the elders -- `Witnesses! Jehovah make the woman who is coming in unto thy house as Rachel and as Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and do thou virtuously in Ephrathah, and proclaim the Name in Beth-Lehem;"
8004012,8,4,12,"and let thy house be as the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare to Judah), of the seed which Jehovah doth give to thee of this young woman.'"
8004013,8,4,13,"And Boaz taketh Ruth, and she becometh his wife, and he goeth in unto her, and Jehovah giveth to her conception, and she beareth a son."
8004014,8,4,14,"And the women say unto Naomi, `Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath not let a redeemer cease to thee to-day, and his name is proclaimed in Israel,"
8004015,8,4,15,"and he hath been to thee for a restorer of life, and for a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law who hath loved thee -- who is better to thee than seven sons -- hath borne him.'"
8004016,8,4,16,"And Naomi taketh the lad, and layeth him in her bosom, and is to him for a nurse;"
8004017,8,4,17,"and the neighbouring women give to him a name, saying, `There hath been a son born to Naomi,' and they call his name Obed; he `is' father of Jesse, father of David."
8004018,8,4,18,"And these are genealogies of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,"
8004019,8,4,19,"and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminidab,"
8004020,8,4,20,"and Amminidab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
8004021,8,4,21,"and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8004022,8,4,22,"and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
9001001,9,1,1,"And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name `is' Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, and Ephrathite,"
9001002,9,1,2,"and he hath two wives, the name of the one `is' Hannah, and the name of the second Peninnah, and Peninnah hath children, and Hannah hath no children."
9001003,9,1,3,"And that man hath gone up out of his city from time to time, to bow himself, and to sacrifice, before Jehovah of Hosts, in Shiloh, and there `are' two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah."
9001004,9,1,4,"And the day cometh, and Elkanah sacrificeth, and he hath given to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,"
9001005,9,1,5,"and to Hannah he giveth a certain portion -- double, for he hath loved Hannah, and Jehovah hath shut her womb;"
9001006,9,1,6,"and her adversity hath also provoked her greatly, so as to make her tremble, for Jehovah hath shut up her womb."
9001007,9,1,7,"And so he doth year by year, from the time of her going up into the house of Jehovah, so it provoketh her, and she weepeth, and doth not eat."
9001008,9,1,8,"And Elkanah her husband saith to her, `Hannah, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why is thy heart afflicted? am I not better to thee than ten sons?'"
9001009,9,1,9,"And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking, and Eli the priest is sitting on the throne by the side-post of the temple of Jehovah."
9001010,9,1,10,"And she is bitter in soul, and prayeth unto Jehovah, and weepeth greatly,"
9001011,9,1,11,"and voweth a vow, and saith, `Jehovah of Hosts, if Thou dost certainly look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and hast remembered me, and dost not forget Thy handmaid, and hast given to Thy handmaid seed of men -- then I have given him to Jehovah all days of his life, and a razor doth not go up upon his head.'"
9001012,9,1,12,"And it hath been, when she multiplied praying before Jehovah, that Eli is watching her mouth,"
9001013,9,1,13,"and Hannah, she is speaking to her heart, only her lips are moving, and her voice is not heard, and Eli reckoneth her to be drunken."
9001014,9,1,14,"And Eli saith unto her, `Until when are thou drunken? turn aside thy wine from thee.'"
9001015,9,1,15,"And Hannah answereth and saith, `No, my lord, A woman sharply pained in spirit I `am', and wine and strong drink I have not drunk, and I pour out my soul before Jehovah;"
9001016,9,1,16,"put not thy handmaid before a daughter of worthlessness, for from the abundance of my meditation, and of my provocation, I have spoken hitherto.'"
9001017,9,1,17,"And Eli answereth and saith, `Go in peace, and the God of Israel doth give thy petition which thou hast asked of Him.'"
9001018,9,1,18,"And she saith, `Let thy handmaid find grace in thine eyes;' and the woman goeth on her way, and eateth, and her countenance hath not been `sad' for it any more."
9001019,9,1,19,"And they rise early in the morning, and bow themselves before Jehovah, and turn back, and come in unto their house in Ramah, and Elkanah knoweth Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembereth her;"
9001020,9,1,20,"and it cometh to pass, at the revolution of the days, that Hannah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Samuel, `for, from Jehovah I have asked him.'"
9001021,9,1,21,"And the man Elkanah goeth up, and all his house, to sacrifice to Jehovah the sacrifice of the days, and his vow."
9001022,9,1,22,"And Hannah hath not gone up, for she said to her husband, `Till the youth is weaned -- then I have brought him in, and he hath appeared before the face of Jehovah, and dwelt there -- unto the age.'"
9001023,9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband saith to her, `Do that which is good in thine eyes; abide till thy weaning him; only, Jehovah establish His word;' and the woman abideth and suckleth her son till she hath weaned him,"
9001024,9,1,24,"and she causeth him to go up with her when she hath weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she bringeth him into the house of Jehovah at Shiloh, and the youth `is but' a youth."
9001025,9,1,25,"And they slaughter the bullock, and bring in the youth unto Eli,"
9001026,9,1,26,"and she saith, `O, my lord, thy soul liveth! my lord, I `am' the woman who stood with thee in this `place', to pray unto Jehovah;"
9001027,9,1,27,"for this youth I prayed, and Jehovah doth give to me my petition which I asked of Him;"
9001028,9,1,28,"and also I have caused him to be asked for Jehovah, all the days that he hath lived -- he is asked for Jehovah;' and he boweth himself there before Jehovah."
9002001,9,2,1,"And Hannah prayeth, and saith: `My heart hath exulted in Jehovah, My horn hath been high in Jehovah, My mouth hath been large over mine enemies, For I have rejoiced in Thy salvation."
9002002,9,2,2,"There is none holy like Jehovah, For there is none save Thee, And there is no rock like our God."
9002003,9,2,3,"Ye multiply not -- ye speak haughtily -- The old saying goeth out from your mouth, For a God of knowledge `is' Jehovah, And by Him actions are weighed."
9002004,9,2,4,"Bows of the mighty are broken, And the stumbling have girded on strength."
9002005,9,2,5,"The satiated for bread hired themselves, And the hungry have ceased. While the barren hath borne seven, And she abounding with sons hath languished."
9002006,9,2,6,"Jehovah putteth to death, and keepeth alive, He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up."
9002007,9,2,7,"Jehovah dispossesseth, and He maketh rich, He maketh low, yea, He maketh high."
9002008,9,2,8,"He raiseth from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He lifteth up the needy, To cause `them' to sit with nobles, Yea, a throne of honour He doth cause them to inherit, For to Jehovah `are' the fixtures of earth, And He setteth on them the habitable world."
9002009,9,2,9,"The feet of His saints He keepeth, And the wicked in darkness are silent, For not by power doth man become mighty."
9002010,9,2,10,"Jehovah -- broken down are His adversaries, Against them in the heavens He thundereth: Jehovah judgeth the ends of earth, And giveth strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His anointed.'"
9002011,9,2,11,"And Elkanah goeth to Ramath, unto his house, and the youth hath been serving Jehovah, `in' the presence of Eli the priest;"
9002012,9,2,12,"and the sons of Eli `are' sons of worthlessness, they have not known Jehovah."
9002013,9,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people `is': any man sacrificing a sacrifice -- then hath the servant of the priest come in when the flesh is boiling, and the hook of three teeth in his hand,"
9002014,9,2,14,"and hath struck `it' into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the hook bringeth up doth the priest take for himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there, in Shiloh."
9002015,9,2,15,"Also before they make perfume with the fat -- then hath the priest's servant come in, and said to the man who is sacrificing, `Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he doth not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;'"
9002016,9,2,16,"and the man saith unto him, `Let them surely make a perfume (as to-day) with the fat, then take to thee as thy soul desireth;' and he hath said to him, `Surely now thou dost give; and if not -- I have taken by strength.'"
9002017,9,2,17,"And the sin of the young men is very great `in' the presence of Jehovah, for the men have despised the offering of Jehovah."
9002018,9,2,18,"And Samuel is ministering `in' the presence of Jehovah, a youth girt `with' an ephod of linen;"
9002019,9,2,19,"and a small upper coat doth his mother make to him, and she hath brought it up to him from time to time, in her coming up with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of the time."
9002020,9,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, `Jehovah doth appoint for thee seed of this woman, for the petition which she asked for Jehovah;' and they have gone to their place."
9002021,9,2,21,"When Jehovah hath looked after Hannah, then she conceiveth and beareth three sons and two daughters; and the youth Samuel groweth up with Jehovah."
9002022,9,2,22,"And Eli `is' very old, and hath heard all that his sons do to all Israel, and how that they lie with the women who are assembling `at' the opening of the tent of meeting,"
9002023,9,2,23,"and he saith to them, `Why do ye things like these? for I am hearing of your evil words from all the people -- these!"
9002024,9,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for the report which I am hearing is not good causing the people of Jehovah to transgress. --"
9002025,9,2,25,"If a man sin against a man, then hath God judged him; but if against Jehovah a man sin, who doth pray for him?' and they hearken not to the voice of their father, though Jehovah hath delighted to put them to death."
9002026,9,2,26,"And the youth Samuel is going on and growing up, and `is' good both with Jehovah, and also with men."
9002027,9,2,27,"And there cometh a man of God unto Eli, and saith unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Was I really revealed unto the house of thy father in their being in Egypt, before Pharaoh's house,"
9002028,9,2,28,"even to choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to Me for a priest, to go up on Mine altar, to make a perfume, to bear an ephod before Me, and I give to the house of thy father all the fire-offerings of the sons of Israel?"
9002029,9,2,29,"Why do ye kick at My sacrifice, and at Mine offering which I commanded `in' My habitation, and dost honour thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat from the first part of every offering of Israel, of My people?"
9002030,9,2,30,"`Therefore -- the affirmation of Jehovah, God of Israel -- I certainly said, Thy house and the house of thy father, do walk up and down before Me to the age; and now -- the affirmation of Jehovah -- Far be it from Me! for he who is honouring Me, I honour, and those despising Me, are lightly esteemed."
9002031,9,2,31,"`Lo, days `are' coming, and I have cut off thine arm, and the arm of the house of thy father, that an old man is not in thy house;"
9002032,9,2,32,"and thou hast beheld an adversary `in My' habitation, in all that He doth good with Israel, and there is not an old man in thy house all the days."
9002033,9,2,33,"`And the man I cut not off of thine from Mine altar, `is' to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house do die men;"
9002034,9,2,34,"and this `is' to thee the sign that cometh unto thy two sons, unto Hophni and Phinehas -- in one day they die both of them;"
9002035,9,2,35,"and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My heart and in My soul he doth do; and I have built for him a stedfast house, and he hath walked up and down before Mine anointed all the days;"
9002036,9,2,36,"and it hath been, every one who is left in thy house doth come in to bow himself to him, for a wage of silver, and a cake of bread, and hath said, Admit me, I pray thee, unto one of the priest's offices, to eat a morsel of bread.'"
9003001,9,3,1,"And the youth Samuel is serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah hath been precious in those days -- there is no vision broken forth."
9003002,9,3,2,"And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim -- he is not able to see."
9003003,9,3,3,"And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is lying down in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God `is',"
9003004,9,3,4,"and Jehovah calleth unto Samuel, and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
9003005,9,3,5,"And he runneth unto Eli, and saith, `Here `am' I, for thou hast called for me;' and he saith, `I called not; turn back, lie down;' and he goeth and lieth down."
9003006,9,3,6,"And Jehovah addeth to call again Samuel, and Samuel riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here `am' I, for thou hast called for me;' and he saith, `I have not called, my son, turn back, lie down.'"
9003007,9,3,7,"And Samuel hath not yet known Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah is not yet revealed unto him."
9003008,9,3,8,"And Jehovah addeth to call Samuel the third time, and he riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here `am' I, for thou hast called for me;' and Eli understandeth that Jehovah is calling to the youth."
9003009,9,3,9,"And Eli saith to Samuel, `Go, lie down, and it hath been, if He doth call unto thee, that thou hast said, Speak, Jehovah, for Thy servant is hearing;' and Samuel goeth and lieth down in his place."
9003010,9,3,10,"And Jehovah cometh, and stationeth Himself, and calleth as time by time, `Samuel, Samuel;' and Samuel saith, `Speak, for Thy servant if hearing.'"
9003011,9,3,11,"And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Lo, I am doing a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one hearing it do tingle."
9003012,9,3,12,"In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken unto his house, beginning and completing;"
9003013,9,3,13,"and I have declared to him that I am judging his house -- to the age, for the iniquity which he hath known, for his sons are making themselves vile, and he hath not restrained them,"
9003014,9,3,14,"and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice, and by offering -- unto the age.'"
9003015,9,3,15,"And Samuel lieth till the morning, and openeth the doors of the house of Jehovah, and Samuel is afraid of declaring the vision unto Eli."
9003016,9,3,16,"And Eli calleth Samuel, and saith, `Samuel, my son;' and he saith, `Here `am' I.'"
9003017,9,3,17,"And he saith, `What `is' the word which He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me; so doth God do to thee, and so doth He add, if thou hidest from me a word of all the words that He hath spoken unto thee.'"
9003018,9,3,18,"And Samuel declareth to him the whole of the words, and hath not hid from him; and he saith, `It `is' Jehovah; that which is good in His eyes He doth.'"
9003019,9,3,19,"And Samuel groweth up, and Jehovah hath been with him, and hath not let fall any of his words to the earth;"
9003020,9,3,20,"and all Israel know, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, that Samuel is established for a prophet to Jehovah."
9003021,9,3,21,"And Jehovah addeth to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah hath been revealed unto Samuel, in Shiloh, by the word of Jehovah."
9004001,9,4,1,"And the word of Samuel is to all Israel, and Israel goeth out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamp by Eben-Ezer, and the Philistines have encamped in Aphek,"
9004002,9,4,2,"and the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel, and the battle spreadeth itself, and Israel is smitten before the Philistines, and they smite among the ranks in the field about four thousand men."
9004003,9,4,3,"And the people cometh in unto the camp, and the elders of Israel say, `Why hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? we take unto us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and it cometh into our midst, and He doth save us out of the hand of our enemies.'"
9004004,9,4,4,"And the people sendeth to Shiloh, and they take up thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of Hosts, inhabiting the cherubs, and there `are' two sons of Eli, with the ark of the covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas."
9004005,9,4,5,"And it cometh to pass, at the coming in of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto the camp, that all Israel shout -- a great shout -- and the earth is moved."
9004006,9,4,6,"And the Philistines hear the noise of the shouting, and say, `What `is' the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' and they perceive that the ark of Jehovah hath come in unto the camp."
9004007,9,4,7,"And the Philistines are afraid, for they said, `God hath come in unto the camp;' and they say, `Wo to us, for there hath not been like this heretofore."
9004008,9,4,8,"Wo to us, who doth deliver us out of the hand of these honourable gods? these `are' the gods who are smiting the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness."
9004009,9,4,9,"Strengthen yourselves, and become men, O Philistines, lest ye do service to Hebrews, as they have done to you -- then ye have become men, and have fought.'"
9004010,9,4,10,"And the Philistines fight, and Israel is smitten, and they flee each to his tents, and the blow is very great, and there fall of Israel thirty thousand footmen;"
9004011,9,4,11,"and the ark of God hath been taken, and the two sons of Eli have died, Hophni and Phinehas."
9004012,9,4,12,"And a man of Benjamin runneth out of the ranks, and cometh into Shiloh, on that day, and his long robes `are' rent, and earth on his head;"
9004013,9,4,13,"and he cometh in, and lo, Eli is sitting on the throne by the side of the way, watching, for his heart hath been trembling for the ark of God, and the man hath come in to declare `it' in the city, and all the city crieth out."
9004014,9,4,14,"And Eli heareth the noise of the cry, and saith, `What -- the noise of this tumult!' And the man hasted, and cometh in, and declareth to Eli."
9004015,9,4,15,"And Eli is a son of ninety and eight years, and his eyes have stood, and he hath not been able to see."
9004016,9,4,16,"And the man saith unto Eli, `I `am' he who hath come out of the ranks, and I out of the ranks have fled to-day;' and he saith, `What hath been the matter, my son?'"
9004017,9,4,17,"And he who is bearing tidings answereth and saith, `Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and also a great slaughter hath been among the people, and also thy two sons have died -- Hophni and Phinehas -- and the ark of God hath been captured.'"
9004018,9,4,18,"And it cometh to pass, at his mentioning the ark of God, that he falleth from off the throne backward, by the side of the gate, and his neck is broken, and he dieth, for the man `is' old and heavy, and he hath judged Israel forty years."
9004019,9,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, `is' pregnant, about to bear, and she heareth the report of the taking of the ark of God, that her father-in-law and her husband have died, and she boweth, and beareth, for her pains have turned upon her."
9004020,9,4,20,"And at the time of her death, when the women who are standing by her say, `Fear not, for a son thou hast borne,' she hath not answered, nor set her heart `to it';"
9004021,9,4,21,"and she calleth the youth I-Chabod, saying, `Honour hath removed from Israel,' because of the taking of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
9004022,9,4,22,"And she saith, `Honour hath removed from Israel, for the ark of God hath been taken.'"
9005001,9,5,1,"And the Philistines have taken the ark of God, and bring it in from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod,"
9005002,9,5,2,"and the Philistines take the ark of God and bring it into the house of Dagon, and set it near Dagon."
9005003,9,5,3,"And the Ashdodites rise early on the morrow, and lo, Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Jehovah; and they take Dagon, and put it back to its place."
9005004,9,5,4,"And they rise early in the morning on the morrow, and lo, Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Jehovah, and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of its hands are cut off at the threshold, only the fishy part hath been left to him;"
9005005,9,5,5,"therefore the priests of Dagon, and all those coming into the house of Dagon, tread not on the threshold of Dagon, in Ashdod, till this day."
9005006,9,5,6,"And the hand of Jehovah is heavy on the Ashdodites, and He maketh them desolate, and smiteth them with emerods, Ashdod and its borders."
9005007,9,5,7,"And the men of Ashdod see that `it is' so, and have said, `The ark of the God of Israel doth not abide with us, for hard hath been His hand upon us, and upon Dagon our god.'"
9005008,9,5,8,"And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines unto them, and say, `What do we do to the ark of the God of Israel?' and they say, `To Gath let the ark of the God of Israel be brought round;' and they bring round the ark of the God of Israel;"
9005009,9,5,9,"and it cometh to pass after they have brought it round, that the hand of Jehovah is against the city -- a very great destruction; and He smiteth the men of the city, from small even unto great; and break forth on them do emerods."
9005010,9,5,10,"And they send the ark of God to Ekron, and it cometh to pass, at the coming in of the ark of God to Ekron, that the Ekronites cry out, saying, `They have brought round unto us the ark of the God of Israel, to put us to death -- and our people.'"
9005011,9,5,11,"And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines, and say, `Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and it turneth back to its place, and it doth not put us to death -- and our people;' for there hath been a deadly destruction throughout all the city, very heavy hath the hand of God been there,"
9005012,9,5,12,"and the men who have not died have been smitten with emerods, and the cry of the city goeth up into the heavens."
9006001,9,6,1,"And the ark of Jehovah is in the field of the Philistines seven months,"
9006002,9,6,2,"and the Philistines call for priests and for diviners, saying, `What do we do to the ark of Jehovah? let us know wherewith we send it to its place?'"
9006003,9,6,3,"And they say, `If ye are sending away the ark of the God of Israel, ye do not send it away empty; for ye do certainly send back to Him a guilt-offering; then ye are healed, and it hath been known to you why His hand doth not turn aside from you.'"
9006004,9,6,4,"And they say, `What `is' the guilt-offering which we send back to Him?' and they say, `The number of the princes of the Philistines -- five golden emerods, and five golden mice -- for one plague `is' to you all, and to your princes,"
9006005,9,6,5,"and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the God of Israel; it may be He doth lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land;"
9006006,9,6,6,"and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? do they not -- when He hath rolled Himself upon them -- send them away, and they go?"
9006007,9,6,7,"`And now, take and make one new cart, and two suckling kine, on which a yoke hath not gone up, and ye have bound the kine in the cart, and caused their young ones to turn back from after them to the house,"
9006008,9,6,8,"and ye have taken the ark of Jehovah, and put it on the cart, and the vessels of gold which ye have returned to Him -- a guilt-offering -- ye put in a coffer on its side, and have sent it away, and it hath gone;"
9006009,9,6,9,"and ye have seen, if the way of its own border it goeth up to Beth-Shemesh -- He hath done to us this great evil; and if not, then we have known that His hand hath not come against us; an accident it hath been to us.'"
9006010,9,6,10,"And the men do so, and take two suckling kine, and bind them in the cart, and their young ones they have shut up in the house;"
9006011,9,6,11,"and they place the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods."
9006012,9,6,12,"And the kine go straight in the way, on the way to Beth-Shemesh, in one highway they have gone, going and lowing, and have not turned aside right or left; and the princes of the Philistines are going after them unto the border of Beth-Shemesh."
9006013,9,6,13,"And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in the valley, and they lift up their eyes, and see the ark, and rejoice to see `it'."
9006014,9,6,14,"And the cart hath come in unto the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite, and standeth there, and there `is' a great stone, and they cleave the wood of the cart, and the kine they have caused to ascend -- a burnt-offering to Jehovah."
9006015,9,6,15,"And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer which `is' with it, in which `are' the vessels of gold, and place `them' on the great stone; and the men of Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Jehovah;"
9006016,9,6,16,"and the five princes of the Philistines have seen `it', and turn back `to' Ekron, on that day."
9006017,9,6,17,"And these `are' the golden emerods which the Philistines have sent back -- a guilt-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;"
9006018,9,6,18,"and the golden mice -- the number of all the cities of the Philistines -- for the five princes, from the fenced city even unto the hamlet of the villages, even unto the great meadow on which they placed the ark of Jehovah -- `are' unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite."
9006019,9,6,19,"And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they looked into the ark of Jehovah, yea, He smiteth among the people seventy men -- fifty chief men; and the people mourn, because Jehovah smote among the people -- a great smiting."
9006020,9,6,20,"And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, `Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and unto whom doth He go up from us?'"
9006021,9,6,21,"And they send messengers unto the inhabitants of Kirjath-Jearim, saying, `The Philistines have sent back the ark of Jehovah; come down, take it up unto you.'"
9007001,9,7,1,"And the men of Kirjath-Jearim come and bring up the ark of Jehovah, and bring it in unto the house of Abinadab, in the height, and Eleazar his son they have sanctified to keep the ark of Jehovah."
9007002,9,7,2,"And it cometh to pass, from the day of the dwelling of the ark in Kirjath-Jearim, that the days are multiplied -- yea, they are twenty years -- and wail do all the house of Israel after Jehovah."
9007003,9,7,3,"And Samuel speaketh unto all the house of Israel, saying, `If with all your heart ye are turning back unto Jehovah -- turn aside the gods of the stranger from your midst, and Ashtaroth; and prepare your heart unto Jehovah, and serve Him only, and He doth deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.'"
9007004,9,7,4,"And the sons of Israel turn aside the Baalim and Ashtaroth, and serve Jehovah alone;"
9007005,9,7,5,"and Samuel saith, `Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I pray for you unto Jehovah.'"
9007006,9,7,6,"And they are gathered to Mizpeh, and draw water, and pour out before Jehovah, and fast on that day, and say there, `We have sinned against Jehovah;' and Samuel judgeth the sons of Israel in Mizpeh."
9007007,9,7,7,"And the Philistines hear that the sons of Israel have gathered themselves to Mizpeh; and the princes of the Philistines go up against Israel, and the sons of Israel hear, and are afraid of the presence of the Philistines."
9007008,9,7,8,"And the sons of Israel say unto Samuel, `Keep not silent for us from crying unto Jehovah our God, and He doth save us out of the hand of the Philistines.'"
9007009,9,7,9,"And Samuel taketh a fat lamb, and causeth it to go up -- a burnt-offering whole to Jehovah; and Samuel crieth unto Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answereth him;"
9007010,9,7,10,"and Samuel is causing the burnt-offering to go up -- and the Philistines have drawn nigh to battle against Israel -- and Jehovah doth thunder with a great noise, on that day, upon the Philistines, and troubleth them, and they are smitten before Israel."
9007011,9,7,11,"And the men of Israel go out from Mizpeh, and pursue the Philistines, and smite them unto the place of Beth-Car."
9007012,9,7,12,"And Samuel taketh a stone, and setteth `it' between Mizpeh and Shen, and calleth its name Eben-Ezer, saying, `Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.'"
9007013,9,7,13,"And the Philistines are humbled, and have not added any more to come into the border of Israel, and the hand of Jehovah is on the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
9007014,9,7,14,And the cities which the Philistines have taken from Israel are restored to Israel -- from Ekron even unto Gath -- and their border hath Israel delivered out of the hand of the Philistines; and there is peace between Israel and the Amorite.
9007015,9,7,15,"And Samuel judgeth Israel all the days of his life,"
9007016,9,7,16,"and he hath gone from year to year, and gone round Beth-El, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel `in' all these places;"
9007017,9,7,17,"and his returning `is' to Ramath, for there `is' his house, and there he hath judged Israel, and he buildeth there an altar to Jehovah."
9008001,9,8,1,"And it cometh to pass, when Samuel `is' aged, that he maketh his sons judges over Israel."
9008002,9,8,2,"And the name of his first-born son is Joel, and the name of his second Abiah, judges in Beer-Sheba:"
9008003,9,8,3,"and his sons have not walked in his ways, and turn aside after the dishonest gain, and take a bribe, and turn aside judgment."
9008004,9,8,4,"And all the elders of Israel gather themselves together, and come in unto Samuel to Ramath,"
9008005,9,8,5,"and say unto him, `Lo, thou hast become aged, and thy sons have not walked in thy ways; now, appoint to us a king, to judge us, like all the nations.'"
9008006,9,8,6,"And the thing is evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they have said, `Give to us a king to judge us;' and Samuel prayeth unto Jehovah."
9008007,9,8,7,"And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to the voice of the people, to all that they say unto thee, for thee they have not rejected, but Me they have rejected, from reigning over them."
9008008,9,8,8,"According to all the works that they have done from the day of My bringing them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, when they forsake Me, and serve other gods -- so they are doing also to thee."
9008009,9,8,9,"And now, hearken to their voice; only, surely thou dost certainly protest to them, and hast declared to them the custom of the king who doth reign over them.'"
9008010,9,8,10,"And Samuel speaketh all the words of Jehovah unto the people who are asking from him a king,"
9008011,9,8,11,"and saith, `This is the custom of the king who doth reign over you: Your sons he doth take, and hath appointed for himself among his chariots, and among his horsemen, and they have run before his chariots;"
9008012,9,8,12,"also to appoint for himself heads of thousands, and heads of fifties; also to plow his plowing, and to reap his reaping; and to make instruments of his war, and instruments of his charioteer."
9008013,9,8,13,"`And your daughters he doth take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers;"
9008014,9,8,14,"and your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards -- the best -- he doth take, and hath given to his servants."
9008015,9,8,15,"And your seed and your vineyards he doth tithe, and hath given to his eunuchs, and to his servants."
9008016,9,8,16,"And your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your young men -- the best, and your asses, he doth take, and hath prepared for his own work;"
9008017,9,8,17,"your flock he doth tithe, and ye are to him for servants."
9008018,9,8,18,"And ye have cried out in that day because of the king whom ye have chosen for yourselves, and Jehovah doth not answer you in that day.'"
9008019,9,8,19,"And the people refuse to hearken to the voice of Samuel, and say, `Nay, but a king is over us,"
9008020,9,8,20,"and we have been, even we, like all the nations; and our king hath judged us, and gone out before us, and fought our battles.'"
9008021,9,8,21,"And Samuel heareth all the words of the people, and speaketh them in the ears of Jehovah;"
9008022,9,8,22,"and Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to their voice, and thou hast caused to reign over them a king.' And Samuel saith unto the men of Israel, `Go ye each to his city.'"
9009001,9,9,1,"And there is a man of Benjamin, and his name `is' Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, mighty of valour,"
9009002,9,9,2,"and he hath a son, and his name `is' Saul, a choice youth and goodly, and there is not a man among the sons of Israel goodlier than he -- from his shoulder and upward, higher than any of the people."
9009003,9,9,3,"And the asses of Kish, father of Saul, are lost, and Kish saith unto Saul his son, `Take, I pray thee, with thee, one of the young men, and rise, go, seek the asses.'"
9009004,9,9,4,"And he passeth over through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passeth over through the land of Shalisha, and they have not found; and they pass over through the land of Shaalim, and they are not; and he passeth over through the land of Benjamin, and they have not found."
9009005,9,9,5,"They have come in unto the land of Zuph, and Saul hath said to his young man who `is' with him, `Come, and we turn back, lest my father leave off from the asses, and hath been sorrowful for us.'"
9009006,9,9,6,"And he saith to him, `Lo, I pray thee, a man of God `is' in this city, and the man is honoured; all that he speaketh doth certainly come; now, we go there, it may be he doth declare to us our way on which we have gone.'"
9009007,9,9,7,"And Saul saith to his young man, `And lo, we go, and what do we bring in to the man? for the bread hath gone from our vessels, and a present there is not to bring in to the man of God -- what `is' with us?'"
9009008,9,9,8,"And the young man addeth to answer Saul, and saith, `Lo, there is found with me a fourth of a shekel of silver: and I have given to the man of God, and he hath declared to us our way.'"
9009009,9,9,9,"Formerly in Israel, thus said the man in his going to seek God, `Come and we go unto the seer,' for the `prophet' of to-day is called formerly `the seer.'"
9009010,9,9,10,"And Saul saith to his young man, `Thy word `is' good; come, we go;' and they go unto the city where the man of God `is'."
9009011,9,9,11,"They are going up in the ascent of the city, and have found young women going out to draw water, and say to them, `Is the seer in this `place'?'"
9009012,9,9,12,"And they answer them and say, `He is; lo, before thee! haste, now, for to-day he hath come in to the city, for the people hath a stated sacrifice in a high place."
9009013,9,9,13,"At your going in to the city so ye do find him, before he doth go up in to the high place to eat; for the people do not eat till his coming, for he doth bless the sacrifice; afterwards they eat, who are called, and now, go up, for at this time ye find him.'"
9009014,9,9,14,"And they go up in to the city; they are coming in to the midst of the city, and lo, Samuel is coming out to meet them, to go up to the high place;"
9009015,9,9,15,"and Jehovah had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before the coming of Saul, saying,"
9009016,9,9,16,"`At this time tomorrow, I send unto thee a man out of the land of Benjamin -- and thou hast anointed him for leader over My people Israel, and he hath saved My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen My people, for its cry hath come in unto Me.'"
9009017,9,9,17,"When Samuel hath seen Saul, then hath Jehovah answered him, `Lo, the man of whom I have spoken unto thee; this `one' doth restrain My people.'"
9009018,9,9,18,"And Saul draweth nigh to Samuel in the midst of the gate, and saith, `Declare, I pray thee, to me, where `is' this -- the seer's house?'"
9009019,9,9,19,"And Samuel answereth Saul and saith, `I `am' the seer; go up before me into the high place, and ye have eaten with me to-day, and I have sent thee away in the morning, and all that `is' in thy heart I declare to thee."
9009020,9,9,20,"As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days, set not thy heart to them, for they have been found; and to whom `is' all the desire of Israel?' is it not to thee and to all thy father's house?'"
9009021,9,9,21,"And Saul answereth and saith, `Am not I a Benjamite -- of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou spoken unto me according to this word?'"
9009022,9,9,22,"And Samuel taketh Saul, and his young man, and bringeth them in to the chamber, and giveth to them a place at the head of those called; and they `are' about thirty men."
9009023,9,9,23,"And Samuel saith to the cook, `Give the portion which I gave to thee, of which I said unto thee, `Set it by thee?'"
9009024,9,9,24,"(and the cook lifteth up the leg, and that which `is' on it, and setteth before Saul), and he saith, `Lo, that which is left; set `it' before thee -- eat, for to this appointed season it is kept for thee, saying, The people I have called;' and Saul eateth with Samuel on that day."
9009025,9,9,25,"And they come down from the high place to the city, and he speaketh with Saul on the roof."
9009026,9,9,26,"And they rise early, and it cometh to pass, at the ascending of the dawn, that Samuel calleth unto Saul, on the roof, saying, `Rise, and I send thee away;' and Saul riseth, and they go out, both of them -- he and Samuel, without."
9009027,9,9,27,"They are going down in the extremity of the city, and Samuel hath said unto Saul, `Say to the young man that he pass on before us (and he passeth on), and thou, stand at this time, and I cause thee to hear the word of God.'"
9010001,9,10,1,"And Samuel taketh the vial of the oil, and poureth on his head, and kisseth him, and saith, `Is it not because Jehovah hath appointed thee over His inheritance for leader?"
9010002,9,10,2,"In thy going to-day from me -- then thou hast found two men by the grave of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin, at Zelzah, and they have said unto thee, The asses have been found which thou hast gone to seek; and lo, thy father hath left the matter of the asses, and hath sorrowed for you, saying, What do I do for my son?"
9010003,9,10,3,"`And thou hast passed on thence, and beyond, and hast come in unto the oak of Tabor, and found thee there have three men going up unto God to Beth-El, one bearing three kids, and one bearing three cakes of bread, and one bearing a bottle of wine,"
9010004,9,10,4,"and they have asked of thee of welfare, and given to thee two loaves, and thou hast received from their hand."
9010005,9,10,5,"`Afterwards thou dost come unto the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines `is', and it cometh to pass, at thy coming in thither to the city, that thou hast met a band of prophets coming down from the high place, and before them psaltery, and tabret, and pipe, and harp, and they are prophesying;"
9010006,9,10,6,"and prospered over thee hath the Spirit of Jehovah, and thou hast prophesied with them, and hast been turned to another man;"
9010007,9,10,7,"and it hath been, when these signs come to thee -- do for thyself as thy hand findeth, for God `is' with thee."
9010008,9,10,8,"`And thou hast gone down before me to Gilgal, and lo, I am going down unto thee, to cause to ascend burnt-offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days thou dost wait till my coming in unto thee, and I have made known to thee that which thou dost do.'"
9010009,9,10,9,"And it hath been, at his turning his shoulder to go from Samuel, that God turneth to him another heart, and all these signs come on that day,"
9010010,9,10,10,"and they come in thither to the height, and lo, a band of prophets -- to meet him, and prosper over him doth the Spirit of God, and he prophesieth in their midst."
9010011,9,10,11,"And it cometh to pass, all his acquaintance heretofore, see, and lo, with prophets he hath prophesied, and the people say one unto another, `What `is' this hath happened to the son of Kish? is Saul also among the prophets?'"
9010012,9,10,12,"And a man thence answereth and saith, `And who `is' their father?' therefore it hath been for a simile, `Is Saul also among the prophets?'"
9010013,9,10,13,"And he ceaseth from prophesying, and cometh in to the high place,"
9010014,9,10,14,"and the uncle of Saul saith unto him, and unto his young man, `Whither went ye?' and he saith, `To seek the asses; and we see that they are not, and we come in unto Samuel.'"
9010015,9,10,15,"And the uncle of Saul saith, `Declare, I pray thee, to me, what Samuel said to you?'"
9010016,9,10,16,"And Saul saith unto his uncle, `He certainly declared to us that the asses were found;' and of the matter of the kingdom he hath not declared to him that which Samuel said."
9010017,9,10,17,"And Samuel calleth the people unto Jehovah to Mizpeh,"
9010018,9,10,18,"and saith unto the sons of Israel, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I have brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms who are oppressing you;"
9010019,9,10,19,"and ye to-day have rejected your God, who `is' Himself your saviour out of all your evils and your distresses, and ye say, `Nay, but -- a king thou dost set over us; and now, station yourselves before Jehovah, by your tribes, and by your thousands.'"
9010020,9,10,20,"And Samuel bringeth near the whole tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is captured,"
9010021,9,10,21,"and he bringeth near the tribe of Benjamin by its families, and the family of Matri is captured, and Saul son of Kish is captured, and they seek him, and he hath not been found."
9010022,9,10,22,"And they ask again at Jehovah, `Hath the man yet come hither?' and Jehovah saith, `Lo, he hath been hidden near the vessels.'"
9010023,9,10,23,"And they run and bring him thence, and he stationed himself in the midst of the people, and he is higher than any of the people from his shoulder and upward."
9010024,9,10,24,"And Samuel saith unto all the people, `Have ye seen him on whom Jehovah hath fixed, for there is none like him among all the people?' And all the people shout, and say, `Let the king live!'"
9010025,9,10,25,"And Samuel speaketh unto the people the right of the kingdom, and writeth in a book, and placeth before Jehovah; and Samuel sendeth all the people away, each to his house."
9010026,9,10,26,"And also Saul hath gone to his house, to Gibeah, and the force go with him whose heart God hath touched;"
9010027,9,10,27,"and the sons of worthlessness have said, `What! this one doth save us!' and they despise him, and have not brought to him a present; and he is as one deaf."
9011001,9,11,1,"And Nahash the Ammonite cometh up, and encampeth against Jabesh-Gilead, and all the men of Jabesh say unto Nahash, `Make with us a covenant, and we serve thee.'"
9011002,9,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite saith unto them, `For this I covenant with you, by picking out to you every right eye -- and I have put it a reproach on all Israel.'"
9011003,9,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh say to him, `Let us alone seven days, and we send messengers into all the border of Israel: and if there is none saving us -- then we have come out unto thee.'"
9011004,9,11,4,"And the messengers come to Gibeah of Saul, and speak the words in the ears of the people, and all the people lift up their voice and weep;"
9011005,9,11,5,"and lo, Saul hath come after the herd out of the field, and Saul saith, `What -- to the people, that they weep?' and they recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh."
9011006,9,11,6,"And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul, in his hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,"
9011007,9,11,7,"and he taketh a couple of oxen, and cutteth them in pieces, and sendeth through all the border of Israel, by the hand of the messengers, saying, `He who is not coming out after Saul and after Samuel -- thus it is done to his oxen;' and the fear of Jehovah falleth on the people, and they come out as one man."
9011008,9,11,8,"And he inspecteth them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel are three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
9011009,9,11,9,"And they say to the messengers who are coming, `Thus do ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye have safety -- by the heat of the sun;' and the messengers come and declare to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoice;"
9011010,9,11,10,"and the men of Jabesh say `to the Ammonites', `To-morrow we come out unto you, and ye have done to us according to all that `is' good in your eyes.'"
9011011,9,11,11,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Saul putteth the people in three detachments, and they come into the midst of the camp in the morning-watch, and smite Ammon till the heat of the day; and it cometh to pass that those left are scattered, and there have not been left of them two together."
9011012,9,11,12,"And the people say unto Samuel, `Who is he that saith, Saul doth reign over us! give ye up the men, and we put them to death.'"
9011013,9,11,13,"And Saul saith, `There is no man put to death on this day, for to-day hath Jehovah wrought salvation in Israel.'"
9011014,9,11,14,"And Samuel saith unto the people, `Come and we go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there;'"
9011015,9,11,15,"and all the people go to Gilgal, and cause Saul to reign there before Jehovah in Gilgal, and sacrifice there sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul rejoiceth -- and all the men of Israel -- very greatly."
9012001,9,12,1,"And Samuel saith unto all Israel, `Lo, I have hearkened to your voice, to all that ye said to me, and I cause to reign over you a king,"
9012002,9,12,2,"and now, lo, the king is walking habitually before you, and I have become aged and gray-headed, and my sons, lo, they `are' with you, and I have walked habitually before you from my youth till this day."
9012003,9,12,3,"`Lo, here `am' I; testify against me, over-against Jehovah, and over-against His anointed; whose ox have I taken, and whose ass have I taken, and whom have I oppressed; whom have I bruised, and of whose hand have I taken a ransom, and hide mine eyes with it? -- and I restore to you.'"
9012004,9,12,4,"And they say, `Thou hast not oppressed us, nor hast thou crushed us, nor hast thou taken from the hand of any one anything.'"
9012005,9,12,5,"And he saith unto them, `A witness `is' Jehovah against you: and a witness `is' His anointed this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand;' and they say, `A witness.'"
9012006,9,12,6,"And Samuel saith unto the people, `Jehovah -- He who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers out of the land of Egypt!"
9012007,9,12,7,"and, now, station yourselves, and I judge you before Jehovah, with all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which He did with you, and with your fathers."
9012008,9,12,8,"`When Jacob hath come in to Egypt, and your fathers cry unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sendeth Moses and Aaron, and they bring out your fathers from Egypt, and cause them to dwell in this place,"
9012009,9,12,9,"and they forget Jehovah their God, and He selleth them into the hand of Sisera, head of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fight against them,"
9012010,9,12,10,"and they cry unto Jehovah, and say, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and now, deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we serve Thee."
9012011,9,12,11,"`And Jehovah sendeth Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivereth you out of the hand of your enemies round about, and ye dwell confidently."
9012012,9,12,12,"`And ye see that Nahash king of the Bene-Ammon hath come against you, and ye say to me, Nay, but a king doth reign over us; and Jehovah your God `is' your king!"
9012013,9,12,13,"And, now, lo, the king whom ye have chosen -- whom ye have asked! and lo, Jehovah hath placed over you a king."
9012014,9,12,14,"`If ye fear Jehovah, and have served Him, and hearkened to His voice, then ye do not provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and ye have been -- both ye and the king who hath reigned over you -- after Jehovah your God."
9012015,9,12,15,"`And if ye do not hearken to the voice of Jehovah -- then ye have provoked the mouth of Jehovah, and the hand of Jehovah hath been against you, and against your fathers."
9012016,9,12,16,"`Also now, station yourselves and see this great thing which Jehovah is doing before your eyes;"
9012017,9,12,17,"is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I call unto Jehovah, and He doth give voices and rain; and know ye and see that your evil is great which ye have done in the eyes of Jehovah, to ask for you a king.'"
9012018,9,12,18,"And Samuel calleth unto Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth voices and rain, on that day, and all the people greatly fear Jehovah and Samuel;"
9012019,9,12,19,"and all the people say unto Samuel, `Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, and we do not die, for we have added to all our sins evil to ask for us a king.'"
9012020,9,12,20,"And Samuel saith unto the people, `Fear not; ye have done all this evil; only, turn not aside from after Jehovah -- and ye have served Jehovah with all your heart,"
9012021,9,12,21,"and ye do not turn aside after the vain things which do not profit nor deliver, for they `are' vain,"
9012022,9,12,22,"for Jehovah doth not leave His people, on account of His great name; for Jehovah hath been pleased to make you to Him for a people."
9012023,9,12,23,"`I, also, far be it from me to sin against Jehovah, by ceasing to pray for you, and I have directed you in the good and upright way;"
9012024,9,12,24,"only, fear ye Jehovah, and ye have served Him in truth with all your heart, for see that which He hath made great with you;"
9012025,9,12,25,"and if ye really do evil, both ye and your king are consumed.'"
9013001,9,13,1,"A son of a year `is' Saul in his reigning, yea, two years he hath reigned over Israel,"
9013002,9,13,2,"and Saul chooseth for himself three thousand `men' out of Israel; and two thousand are with Saul in Michmash, and in the hill-country of Beth-El; and a thousand have been with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the remnant of the people he hath sent each to his tents."
9013003,9,13,3,"And Jonathan smiteth the garrison of the Philistines which `is' in Geba, and the Philistines hear, and Saul hath blown with a trumpet through all the land, saying, `Let the Hebrews hear.'"
9013004,9,13,4,"And all Israel have heard, saying, `Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines,' and also, `Israel hath been abhorred by the Philistines;' and the people are called after Saul to Gilgal."
9013005,9,13,5,"And the Philistines have been gathered to fight with Israel; thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a people as the sand which `is' on the sea-shore for multitude; and they come up and encamp in Michmash, east of Beth-Aven."
9013006,9,13,6,"And the men of Israel have seen that they are distressed, that the people hath been oppressed, and the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
9013007,9,13,7,"And Hebrews have passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; and Saul `is' yet in Gilgal, and all the people have trembled after him."
9013008,9,13,8,"And he waiteth seven days, according to the appointment with Samuel, and Samuel hath not come to Gilgal, and the people are scattered from off him."
9013009,9,13,9,"And Saul saith, `Bring nigh unto me the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings;' and he causeth the burnt-offering to ascend."
9013010,9,13,10,"And it cometh to pass at his completing to cause the burnt-offering to ascend, that lo, Samuel hath come, and Saul goeth out to meet him, to bless him;"
9013011,9,13,11,"and Samuel saith, `What hast thou done?' And Saul saith, `Because I saw that the people were scattered from off me, and thou hadst not come at the appointment of the days, and the Philistines are gathered to Michmash,"
9013012,9,13,12,"and I say, Now do the Philistines come down unto me to Gilgal, and the face of Jehovah I have not appeased; and I force myself, and cause the burnt-offering to ascend.'"
9013013,9,13,13,"And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Thou hast been foolish; thou hast not kept the command of Jehovah thy God, which He commanded thee, for now had Jehovah established thy kingdom over Israel unto the age;"
9013014,9,13,14,"and, now, thy kingdom doth not stand, Jehovah hath sought for Himself a man according to His own heart, and Jehovah chargeth him for leader over His people, for thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.'"
9013015,9,13,15,"And Samuel riseth, and goeth up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin; and Saul inspecteth the people who are found with him, about six hundred men,"
9013016,9,13,16,"and Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who are found with them, are abiding in Gibeah of Benjamin, and the Philistines have encamped in Michmash."
9013017,9,13,17,"And the destroyer goeth out from the camp of the Philistines -- three detachments; the one detachment turneth unto the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;"
9013018,9,13,18,"and the one detachment turneth the way of Beth-Horon, and the one detachment turneth the way of the border which is looking on the valley of the Zeboim, toward the wilderness."
9013019,9,13,19,"And an artificer is not found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, `Lest the Hebrews make sword or spear;'"
9013020,9,13,20,"and all Israel go down to the Philistines, to sharpen each his ploughshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;"
9013021,9,13,21,"and there hath been the file for mattocks, and for coulters, and for three-pronged rakes, and for the axes, and to set up the goads."
9013022,9,13,22,"And it hath been, in the day of battle, that there hath not been found sword and spear in the hand of any of the people who `are' with Saul and with Jonathan -- and there is found to Saul and to Jonathan his son."
9013023,9,13,23,And the station of the Philistines goeth out unto the passage of Michmash.
9014001,9,14,1,"And the day cometh that Jonathan son of Saul saith unto the young man bearing his weapons, `Come, and we pass over unto the station of the Philistines, which `is' on the other side of this;' and to his father he hath not declared `it'."
9014002,9,14,2,"And Saul is abiding at the extremity of Gibeah, under the pomegranate which `is' in Migron, and the people who `are' with him, about six hundred men,"
9014003,9,14,3,"and Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of I-Chabod, son of Phinehas son of Eli priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, bearing an ephod; and the people knew not that Jonathan hath gone."
9014004,9,14,4,"And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over unto the station of the Philistines `is' the edge of a rock on the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
9014005,9,14,5,"The one edge `is' fixed on the north over-against Michmash, and the one on the south over-against Gibeah."
9014006,9,14,6,"And Jonathan saith unto the young man bearing his weapons, `Come, and we pass over unto the station of these uncircumcised; it may be Jehovah doth work for us, for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.'"
9014007,9,14,7,"And the bearer of his weapons saith to him, `Do all that `is' in thy heart; turn for thee; lo, I `am' with thee, as thine own heart.'"
9014008,9,14,8,"And Jonathan saith, `Lo, we are passing over unto the men, and are revealed unto them;"
9014009,9,14,9,"if thus they say unto us, `Stand still till we have come unto you,' then we have stood in our place, and do not go up unto them;"
9014010,9,14,10,"and if thus they say, `Come up against us,' then we have gone up, for Jehovah hath given them into our hand, and this to us `is' the sign."
9014011,9,14,11,"And revealed are both of them unto the station of the Philistines, and the Philistines say, `Lo, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.'"
9014012,9,14,12,"And the men of the station answer Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons, and say, `Come up unto us, and we cause you to know something.' And Jonathan saith unto the bearer of his weapons, `Come up after me, for Jehovah hath given them into the hand of Israel.'"
9014013,9,14,13,"And Jonathan goeth up on his hands, and on his feet, and the bearer of his weapons after him; and they fall before Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons is putting to death after him."
9014014,9,14,14,"And the first smiting which Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons have smitten is of about twenty men, in about half a furrow of a yoke of a field,"
9014015,9,14,15,"and there is a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people, the station and the destroyers have trembled -- even they, and the earth shaketh, and it becometh a trembling of God."
9014016,9,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin see, and lo, the multitude hath melted away, and it goeth on, and is beaten down."
9014017,9,14,17,"And Saul saith to the people who `are' with him, `Inspect, I pray you, and see; who hath gone from us?' and they inspect, and lo, Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons are not."
9014018,9,14,18,"And Saul saith to Ahiah, `Bring nigh the ark of God;' for the ark of God hath been on that day with the sons of Israel."
9014019,9,14,19,"And it cometh to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest, that the noise which `is' in the camp of the Philistines goeth on, going on and becoming great, and Saul saith unto the priest, `Remove thy hand.'"
9014020,9,14,20,"And Saul is called, and all the people who `are' with him, and they come in unto the battle, and, lo, the sword of each hath been against his neighbour -- a very great destruction."
9014021,9,14,21,"And the Hebrews `who' have been for the Philistines as heretofore, who had gone up with them into the camp, have turned round, even they, to be with Israel who `are' with Saul and Jonathan,"
9014022,9,14,22,"and all the men of Israel, who are hiding themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, have heard that the Philistines have fled, and they pursue -- even they -- after them in battle."
9014023,9,14,23,"And Jehovah saveth Israel on that day, and the battle hath passed over to Beth-Aven."
9014024,9,14,24,"And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day, and Saul adjureth the people, saying, `Cursed `is' the man who eateth food till the evening, and I have been avenged of mine enemies;' and none of the people hath tasted food."
9014025,9,14,25,"And all `they of' the land have come into a forest, and there is honey on the face of the field;"
9014026,9,14,26,"and the people come in unto the forest, and lo, the honey dropped, and none is moving his hand unto his mouth, for the people feared the oath."
9014027,9,14,27,"And Jonathan hath not heard of his father's adjuring the people, and putteth forth the end of the rod, which `is' in his hand, and dippeth it in the honeycomb, and bringeth back his hand unto his mouth -- and his eyes see!"
9014028,9,14,28,"And a man of the people answereth and saith, `Thy father certainly adjured the people, saying, Cursed `is' the man who eateth food to-day; and the people are weary.'"
9014029,9,14,29,"And Jonathan saith, `My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, that mine eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey."
9014030,9,14,30,"How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the spoil of its enemies which it hath found, for now, the smiting hath not been great among the Philistines.'"
9014031,9,14,31,"And they smite on that day among the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people are very weary,"
9014032,9,14,32,"and the people make unto the spoil, and take sheep, and oxen, and sons of the herd, and slaughter on the earth, and the people eat with the blood."
9014033,9,14,33,"And they declare to Saul, saying, `Lo, the people are sinning against Jehovah, to eat with the blood.' And he saith, `Ye have dealt treacherously, roll unto me to-day a great stone.'"
9014034,9,14,34,"And Saul saith, `Be ye scattered among the people, and ye have said to them, Bring ye nigh unto me each his ox, and each his sheep; and ye have slain `them' in this place, and eaten, and ye do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood.' And all the people bring nigh each his ox, in his hand, that night, and slaughter `them' there."
9014035,9,14,35,And Saul buildeth an alter to Jehovah; with it he hath begun to build altars to Jehovah.
9014036,9,14,36,"And Saul saith, `Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and we prey upon them till the light of the morning, and leave not a man of them.' And they say, `All that is good in thine eyes do.' And the priest saith, `Let us draw near hither unto God.'"
9014037,9,14,37,"And Saul asketh of God, `Do I go down after the Philistines? dost Thou give them into the hand of Israel?' and He hath not answered him on that day."
9014038,9,14,38,"And Saul saith, `Draw ye nigh hither all, the chiefs of the people, and know and see in what this sin hath been to-day;"
9014039,9,14,39,"for, Jehovah liveth, who is saving Israel: surely if it be in Jonathan my son, surely he doth certainly die;' and none is answering him out of all the people."
9014040,9,14,40,"And he saith unto all Israel, `Ye -- ye are on one side, and I and Jonathan my son are on another side;' and the people say unto Saul, `That which is good in thine eyes do.'"
9014041,9,14,41,"And Saul saith unto Jehovah, God of Israel, `Give perfection;' and Jonathan and Saul are captured, and the people went out."
9014042,9,14,42,"And Saul saith, `Cast between me and Jonathan my son;' and Jonathan is captured."
9014043,9,14,43,"And Saul saith unto Jonathan, `Declare to me, what hast thou done?' and Jonathan declareth to him, and saith, `I certainly tasted with the end of the rod that `is' in my hand a little honey; lo, I die!'"
9014044,9,14,44,"And Saul saith, `Thus doth God do, and thus doth He add, for thou dost certainly die, Jonathan.'"
9014045,9,14,45,"And the people say unto Saul, `Doth Jonathan die who wrought this great salvation in Israel? -- a profanation! Jehovah liveth, if there falleth from the hair of his head to the earth, for with God he hath wrought this day;' and the people rescue Jonathan, and he hath not died."
9014046,9,14,46,"And Saul goeth up from after the Philistines, and the Philistines have gone to their place;"
9014047,9,14,47,"and Saul captured the kingdom over Israel, and he fighteth round about against all his enemies, against Moab, and against the Bene-Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines, and whithersoever he turneth he doth vex `them'."
9014048,9,14,48,"And he maketh a force, and smiteth Amalek, and delivereth Israel out of the hand of its spoiler."
9014049,9,14,49,"And the sons of Saul are Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-Shua; as to the name of his two daughters, the name of the first-born `is' Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;"
9014050,9,14,50,"and the name of the wife of Saul `is' Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the head of his host `is' Abner son of Ner, uncle of Saul;"
9014051,9,14,51,"and Kish `is' father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner `is' son of Ahiel."
9014052,9,14,52,"And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul; when Saul hath seen any mighty man, and any son of valour, then he doth gather him unto himself."
9015001,9,15,1,"And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Me did Jehovah send to anoint thee for king over His people, over Israel; and now, hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah:"
9015002,9,15,2,"`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, I have looked after that which Amalek did to Israel, that which he laid for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt."
9015003,9,15,3,"Now, go, and thou hast smitten Amalek, and devoted all that it hath, and thou hast no pity on it, and hast put to death from man unto woman, from infant unto suckling, from ox unto sheep, from camel unto ass.'"
9015004,9,15,4,"And Saul summoneth the people, and inspecteth them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand `are' men of Judah."
9015005,9,15,5,"And Saul cometh in unto a city of Amalek, and layeth wait in a valley;"
9015006,9,15,6,"and Saul saith unto the Kenite, `Go, turn aside, go down from the midst of Amalek, lest I consume thee with it, and thou didst kindness with all the sons of Israel, in their going up out of Egypt;' and the Kenite turneth aside from the midst of Amalek."
9015007,9,15,7,"And Saul smiteth Amalek from Havilah -- thy going in to Shur, which `is' on the front of Egypt,"
9015008,9,15,8,"and he catcheth Agag king of Amalek alive, and all the people he hath devoted by the mouth of the sword;"
9015009,9,15,9,"and Saul hath pity -- also the people -- on Agag, and on the best of the flock, and of the herd, and of the seconds, and on the lambs, and on all that `is' good, and have not been willing to devote them; and all the work, despised and wasted -- it they devoted."
9015010,9,15,10,"And the word of Jehovah is unto Samuel, saying,"
9015011,9,15,11,"`I have repented that I caused Saul to reign for king, for he hath turned back from after Me, and My words he hath not performed;' and it is displeasing to Samuel, and he crieth unto Jehovah all the night."
9015012,9,15,12,"And Samuel riseth early to meet Saul in the morning, and it is declared to Samuel, saying, `Saul hath come in to Carmel, and lo, he is setting up to himself a monument, and goeth round, and passeth over, and goeth down to Gilgal.'"
9015013,9,15,13,"And Samuel cometh in unto Saul, and Saul saith to him, `Blessed `art' thou of Jehovah; I have performed the word of Jehovah.'"
9015014,9,15,14,"And Samuel saith, `And what `is' the noise of this flock in mine ears -- and the noise of the herd which I am hearing?'"
9015015,9,15,15,"And Saul saith, `From Amalek they have brought them, because the people had pity on the best of the flock, and of the herd, in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God, and the remnant we have devoted.'"
9015016,9,15,16,"And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Desist, and I declare to thee that which Jehovah hath spoken unto me to-night;' and he saith to him, `Speak.'"
9015017,9,15,17,"And Samuel saith, `Art not thou, if thou `art' little in thine own eyes, head of the tribes of Israel? and Jehovah doth anoint thee for king over Israel,"
9015018,9,15,18,"and Jehovah sendeth thee in the way, and saith, Go, and thou hast devoted the sinners, the Amalekite, and fought against them till they are consumed;"
9015019,9,15,19,"and why hast thou not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah -- and dost fly unto the spoil, and dost do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah?'"
9015020,9,15,20,"And Saul saith unto Samuel, `Because -- I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and I go in the way which Jehovah hath sent me, and bring in Agag king of Amalek, and Amalek I have devoted;"
9015021,9,15,21,"and the people taketh of the spoil of the flock and herd, the first part of the devoted thing, for sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.'"
9015022,9,15,22,"And Samuel saith, `Hath Jehovah had delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as `in' hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? lo, hearkening than sacrifice is better; to give attention than fat of rams;"
9015023,9,15,23,"for a sin of divination `is' rebellion, and iniquity and teraphim `is' stubbornness; because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He also doth reject thee from `being' king.'"
9015024,9,15,24,"And Saul saith unto Samuel, `I have sinned, for I passed over the command of Jehovah, and thy words; because I have feared the people, I also hearken to their voice;"
9015025,9,15,25,"and now, bear, I pray thee, with my sin, and turn back with me, and I bow myself to Jehovah.'"
9015026,9,15,26,"And Samuel saith unto Saul, `I do not turn back with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah doth reject thee from being king over Israel.'"
9015027,9,15,27,"And Samuel turneth round to go, and he layeth hold on the skirt of his upper robe -- and it is rent!"
9015028,9,15,28,"And Samuel saith unto him, `Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and given it to thy neighbour who is better than thou;"
9015029,9,15,29,"and also, the Pre-eminence of Israel doth not lie nor repent, for He `is' not a man to be penitent.'"
9015030,9,15,30,"And he saith, `I have sinned; now, honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me; and I have bowed myself to Jehovah thy God.'"
9015031,9,15,31,"And Samuel turneth back after Saul, and Saul boweth himself to Jehovah;"
9015032,9,15,32,"and Samuel saith, `Bring ye nigh unto me Agag king of Amalek,' and Agag cometh unto him daintily, and Agag saith, `Surely the bitterness of death hath turned aside.'"
9015033,9,15,33,"And Samuel saith, `As thy sword bereaved women -- so is thy mother bereaved above women;' and Samuel heweth Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal."
9015034,9,15,34,"And Samuel goeth to Ramath, and Saul hath gone unto his house -- to Gibeah of Saul."
9015035,9,15,35,"And Samuel hath not added to see Saul till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul, and Jehovah repented that He had caused Saul to reign over Israel."
9016001,9,16,1,"And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Till when art thou mourning for Saul, and I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I send thee unto Jesse the Beth-Lehemite, for I have seen among his sons for Myself a king."
9016002,9,16,2,"And Samuel saith, `How do I go? when Saul hath heard, then he hath slain me.' And Jehovah saith, `A heifer of the herd thou dost take in thy hand, and hast said, To sacrifice to Jehovah I have come;"
9016003,9,16,3,"and thou hast called for Jesse in the sacrifice, and I cause thee to know that which thou dost do, and thou hast anointed to Me him of whom I speak unto thee.'"
9016004,9,16,4,"And Samuel doth that which Jehovah hath spoken, and cometh in to Beth-Lehem, and the elders of the city tremble to meet him, and `one' saith, `Is thy coming peace?'"
9016005,9,16,5,"and he saith, `Peace; to sacrifice to Jehovah I have come, sanctify yourselves, and ye have come in with me to the sacrifice;' and he sanctifieth Jesse and his sons, and calleth them to the sacrifice."
9016006,9,16,6,"And it cometh to pass, in their coming in, that he seeth Eliab, and saith, `Surely, before Jehovah `is' His anointed.'"
9016007,9,16,7,"And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Look not unto his appearance, and unto the height of his stature, for I have rejected him; for `it is' not as man seeth -- for man looketh at the eyes, and Jehovah looketh at the heart.'"
9016008,9,16,8,"And Jesse calleth unto Abinadab, and causeth him to pass by before Samuel; and he saith, `Also on this Jehovah hath not fixed.'"
9016009,9,16,9,"And Jesse causeth Shammah to pass by, and he saith, `Also on this Jehovah hath not fixed.'"
9016010,9,16,10,"And Jesse causeth seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel, and Samuel saith to Jesse, `Jehovah hath not fixed on these.'"
9016011,9,16,11,"And Samuel saith unto Jesse, `Are the young men finished?' and he saith, `Yet hath been left the youngest; and lo, he delighteth himself among the flock;' and Samuel saith unto Jesse, `Send and take him, for we do not turn round till his coming in hither.'"
9016012,9,16,12,"And he sendeth, and bringeth him in, and he `is' ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and of good appearance; and Jehovah saith, `Rise, anoint him, for this `is' he.'"
9016013,9,16,13,"And Samuel taketh the horn of oil, and anointeth him in the midst of his brethren, and prosper over David doth the Spirit of Jehovah from that day and onwards; and Samuel riseth and goeth to Ramath."
9016014,9,16,14,"And the Spirit of Jehovah turned aside from Saul, and a spirit of sadness from Jehovah terrified him;"
9016015,9,16,15,"and the servants of Saul say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, a spirit of sadness `from' God is terrifying thee;"
9016016,9,16,16,"let our lord command, we pray thee, thy servants before thee, they seek a skilful man, playing on a harp, and it hath come to pass, in the spirit of sadness `from' God being upon thee, that he hath played with his hand, and `it is' well with thee.'"
9016017,9,16,17,"And Saul saith unto his servants, `Provide, I pray you, for me a man playing well -- then ye have brought `him' in unto me.'"
9016018,9,16,18,"And one of the servants answereth and saith, `Lo, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-Lehemite, skilful in playing, and a mighty virtuous man, and a man of battle, and intelligent in word, and a man of form, and Jehovah `is' with him.'"
9016019,9,16,19,"And Saul sendeth messengers unto Jesse, and saith, `Send unto me David thy son, who `is' with the flock.'"
9016020,9,16,20,"And Jesse taketh an ass, `with' bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sendeth by the hand of David his son unto Saul."
9016021,9,16,21,"And David cometh in unto Saul, and standeth before him, and he loveth him greatly; and he is a bearer of his weapons."
9016022,9,16,22,"And Saul sendeth unto Jesse, saying, `Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he hath found grace in mine eyes.'"
9016023,9,16,23,"And it hath come to pass, in the spirit of `sadness from' God being on Saul, that David hath taken the harp, and played with his hand, and Saul hath refreshment and gladness, and the spirit of sadness hath turned aside from off him."
9017001,9,17,1,"And the Philistines gather their camps to battle, and are gathered to Shochoh, which `is' to Judah, and encamp between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-Dammim;"
9017002,9,17,2,"and Saul and the men of Israel have been gathered, and encamp by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array to meet the Philistines."
9017003,9,17,3,"And the Philistines are standing on the mountain on this side, and the Israelites are standing on the mountain on that side, and the valley `is' between them."
9017004,9,17,4,"And there goeth out a man of the duellists from the camps of the Philistines, Goliath `is' his name, from Gath; his height `is' six cubits and a span,"
9017005,9,17,5,"and a helmet of brass `is' on his head, and `with' a scaled coat of mail he `is' clothed, and the weight of the coat of mail `is' five thousand shekels of brass,"
9017006,9,17,6,"and a frontlet of brass `is' on his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders,"
9017007,9,17,7,"and the wood of his spear `is' like a beam of weavers', and the flame of his spear `is' six hundred shekels of iron, and the bearer of the buckler is going before him."
9017008,9,17,8,"And he standeth and calleth unto the ranks of Israel, and saith to them, `Why are ye come out to set in array the battle? `am' not I the Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose for you a man, and let him come down unto me;"
9017009,9,17,9,"if he be able to fight with me, and have smitten me, then we have been to you for servants; and if I am able for him, and have smitten him, then ye have been to us for servants, and have served us.'"
9017010,9,17,10,"And the Philistine saith, `I have reproached the ranks of Israel this day; give to me a man, and we fight together.'"
9017011,9,17,11,"And Saul heareth -- and all Israel -- these words of the Philistine, and they are broken down and greatly afraid."
9017012,9,17,12,"And David `is' son of this Ephrathite of Beth-Lehem-Judah, whose name `is' Jesse, and he hath eight sons, and the man in the days of Saul hath become aged among men;"
9017013,9,17,13,"and the three eldest sons of Jesse go, they have gone after Saul to battle; and the name of his three sons who have gone into battle `are' Eliab the first-born, and his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
9017014,9,17,14,"And David is the youngest, and the three eldest have gone after Saul,"
9017015,9,17,15,"and David is going and returning from Saul, to feed the flock of his father at Beth-Lehem."
9017016,9,17,16,"And the Philistine draweth nigh, morning and evening, and stationeth himself forty days."
9017017,9,17,17,"And Jesse saith to David his son, `Take, I pray thee, to thy brethren, an ephah of this roasted `corn', and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;"
9017018,9,17,18,"and these ten cuttings of the cheese thou dost take in to the head of the thousand, and thy brethren thou dost inspect for welfare, and their pledge dost receive.'"
9017019,9,17,19,"And Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel `are' in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
9017020,9,17,20,"And David riseth early in the morning, and leaveth the flock to a keeper, and lifteth up, and goeth, as Jesse commanded him, and he cometh in to the path, and to the force which is going out unto the rank, and they have shouted for battle;"
9017021,9,17,21,and Israel and the Philistines set in array rank to meet rank.
9017022,9,17,22,"And David letteth down the goods from off him on the hand of a keeper of the goods, and runneth into the rank, and cometh and asketh of his brethren of welfare."
9017023,9,17,23,"And he is speaking with them, and lo, a man of the duellists is coming up, Goliath the Philistine `is' his name, of Gath, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and he speaketh according to those words, and David heareth;"
9017024,9,17,24,"and all the men of Israel when they see the man flee from his presence, and are greatly afraid."
9017025,9,17,25,"And the men of Israel say, `Have ye seen this man who is coming up? for, to reproach Israel he is coming up, and it hath been -- the man who smiteth him, the king doth enrich him with great riches, and his daughter he doth give to him, and his father's house doth make free in Israel.'"
9017026,9,17,26,"And David speaketh unto the men who are standing by him, saying, `What is done to the man who smiteth this Philistine, and hath turned aside reproach from Israel? for who `is' this uncircumcised Philistine that he hath reproached the ranks of the living God?'"
9017027,9,17,27,"And the people speak to him according to this word, saying, `Thus it is done to the man who smiteth him.'"
9017028,9,17,28,"And Eliab, his eldest brother, heareth when he speaketh unto the men, and the anger of Eliab burneth against David, and he saith, `Why `is' this -- thou hast come down! and to whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I have known thy pride, and the evil of thy heart -- for, to see the battle thou hast come down.'"
9017029,9,17,29,"And David saith, `What have I done now? is it not a word?'"
9017030,9,17,30,"And he turneth round from him unto another, and saith according to this word, and the people return him word as the first word."
9017031,9,17,31,"And the words which David hath spoken are heard, and they declare before Saul, and he receiveth him;"
9017032,9,17,32,"and David saith unto Saul, `Let no man's heart fall because of him, thy servant doth go, and hath fought with this Philistine.'"
9017033,9,17,33,"And Saul saith unto David, `Thou art not able to go unto this Philistine, to fight with him, for a youth thou `art', and he a man of war from his youth.'"
9017034,9,17,34,"And David saith unto Saul, `A shepherd hath thy servant been to his father among the sheep, and the lion hath come -- and the bear -- and hath taken away a sheep out of the drove,"
9017035,9,17,35,"and I have gone out after him, and smitten him, and delivered out of his mouth, and he riseth against me, and I have taken hold on his beard, and smitten him, and put him to death."
9017036,9,17,36,"Both the lion and the bear hath thy servant smitten, and this uncircumcised Philistine hath been as one of them, for he hath reproached the ranks of the living God.'"
9017037,9,17,37,"And David saith, `Jehovah, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He doth deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.' And Saul saith unto David, `Go, and Jehovah is with thee.'"
9017038,9,17,38,"And Saul clotheth David with his long robe, and hath put a helmet of brass on his head, and doth clothe him with a coat of mail."
9017039,9,17,39,"And David girded his sword above his long robe, and beginneth to go, for he hath not tried `it'; and David saith unto Saul, `I am not able to go with these, for I had not tried;' and David turneth them aside from off him."
9017040,9,17,40,"And he taketh his staff in his hand, and chooseth for him five smooth stones from the brook, and putteth them in the shepherds' habiliments that he hath, even in the scrip, and his sling `is' in his hand, and he draweth nigh unto the Philistine."
9017041,9,17,41,"And the Philistine goeth on, going and drawing near unto David, and the man bearing the buckler `is' before him,"
9017042,9,17,42,"and the Philistine looketh attentively, and seeth David, and despiseth him, for he was a youth, and ruddy, with a fair appearance."
9017043,9,17,43,"And the Philistine saith unto David, `Am I a dog that thou art coming unto me with staves?' and the Philistine revileth David by his gods,"
9017044,9,17,44,"and the Philistine saith unto David, `Come unto me, and I give thy flesh to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the field.'"
9017045,9,17,45,"And David saith unto the Philistine, `Thou art coming unto me with sword, and with spear, and with buckler, and I am coming unto thee in the name of Jehovah of Hosts, God of the ranks of Israel, which thou hast reproached."
9017046,9,17,46,"This day doth Jehovah shut thee up into my hand -- and I have smitten thee, and turned aside thy head from off thee, and given the carcase of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the earth, and all the earth do know that God is for Israel."
9017047,9,17,47,"and all this assembly do know that not by sword and by spear doth Jehovah save, that the battle `is' Jehovah's, and He hath given you into our hand.'"
9017048,9,17,48,"And it hath come to pass, that the Philistine hath risen, and goeth, and draweth near to meet David, and David hasteth and runneth to the rank to meet the Philistine,"
9017049,9,17,49,"and David putteth forth his hand unto the vessel, and taketh thence a stone, and slingeth, and smiteth the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sinketh into his forehead, and he falleth on his face to the earth."
9017050,9,17,50,"And David is stronger than the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smiteth the Philistine, and putteth him to death, and there is no sword in the hand of David,"
9017051,9,17,51,"and David runneth and standeth over the Philistine, and taketh his sword, and draweth it out of its sheath, and putteth him to death, and cutteth off with it his head; and the Philistines see that their hero `is' dead, and flee."
9017052,9,17,52,"And the men of Israel rise -- also Judah -- and shout, and pursue the Philistines till thou enter the valley, and unto the gates of Ekron, and the wounded of the Philistines fall in the way of Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron,"
9017053,9,17,53,"and the sons of Israel turn back from burning after the Philistines, and spoil their camps."
9017054,9,17,54,"And David taketh the head of the Philistine, and bringeth it in to Jerusalem, and his weapons he hath put in his own tent."
9017055,9,17,55,"And when Saul seeth David going out to meet the Philistine, he hath said unto Abner, head of the host, `Whose son `is' this -- the youth, Abner?' and Abner saith, `Thy soul liveth, O king, I have not known.'"
9017056,9,17,56,"And the king saith, `Ask thou whose son this `is' -- the young man.'"
9017057,9,17,57,"And when David turneth back from smiting the Philistine, then Abner taketh him and bringeth him in before Saul, and the head of the Philistine in his hand;"
9017058,9,17,58,"and Saul saith unto him, `Whose son `art' thou, O youth?' and David saith, `Son of thy servant Jesse, the Beth-Lehemite.'"
9018001,9,18,1,"And it cometh to pass, when he finisheth to speak unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan hath been bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loveth him as his own soul."
9018002,9,18,2,"And Saul taketh him on that day, and hath not permitted him to turn back to the house of his father."
9018003,9,18,3,"And Jonathan maketh -- also David -- a covenant, because he loveth him as his own soul,"
9018004,9,18,4,"and Jonathan strippeth himself of the upper robe which `is' upon him, and giveth it to David, and his long robe, even unto his sword, and unto his bow, and unto his girdle."
9018005,9,18,5,"And David goeth out whithersoever Saul doth send him; he acted wisely, and Saul setteth him over the men of war, and it is good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul."
9018006,9,18,6,"And it cometh to pass, in their coming in, in David's returning from smiting the Philistine, that the women come out from all the cities of Israel to sing -- also the dancers -- to meet Saul the king, with tabrets, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments;"
9018007,9,18,7,"and the women answer -- those playing, and say, `Saul hath smitten among his thousands, And David among his myriads.'"
9018008,9,18,8,"And it is displeasing to Saul exceedingly, and this thing is evil in his eyes, and he saith, `They have given to David myriads, and to me they have given the thousands, and more to him `is' only the kingdom;'"
9018009,9,18,9,and Saul is eyeing David from that day and thenceforth.
9018010,9,18,10,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the spirit of sadness `from' God prospereth over Saul, and he prophesieth in the midst of the house, and David is playing with his hand, as day by day, and the javelin `is' in the hand of Saul,"
9018011,9,18,11,"and Saul casteth the javelin, and saith, `I smite through David, even through the wall;' and David turneth round out of his presence twice."
9018012,9,18,12,"And Saul is afraid of the presence of David, for Jehovah hath been with him, and from Saul He hath turned aside;"
9018013,9,18,13,"and Saul turneth him aside from him, and appointeth him to himself head of a thousand, and he goeth out an cometh in, before the people."
9018014,9,18,14,"And David is in all his ways acting wisely, and Jehovah `is' with him,"
9018015,9,18,15,"and Saul seeth that he is acting very wisely, and is afraid of him,"
9018016,9,18,16,and all Israel and Judah love David when he is going out and coming in before them.
9018017,9,18,17,"And Saul saith unto David, `Lo, my elder daughter Merab -- her I give to thee for a wife; only, be to me for a son of valour, and fight the battles of Jehovah;' and Saul said, `Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.'"
9018018,9,18,18,"And David saith unto Saul, `Who `am' I? and what my life -- the family of my father in Israel -- that I am son-in-law to the king?'"
9018019,9,18,19,"And it cometh to pass, at the time of the giving of Merab daughter of Saul to David, that she hath been given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife."
9018020,9,18,20,"And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David, and they declare to Saul, and the thing is right in his eyes,"
9018021,9,18,21,"and Saul saith, `I give her to him, and she is to him for a snare, and the hand of the Philistines is on him;' and Saul saith unto David, `By the second -- thou dost become my son-in-law to-day.'"
9018022,9,18,22,"And Saul commandeth his servants, `Speak unto David gently, saying, Lo, the king hath delighted in thee, and all his servants have loved thee, and now, be son-in-law to the king.'"
9018023,9,18,23,"And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these words, and David saith, `Is it a light thing in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king -- and I a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'"
9018024,9,18,24,"And the servants of Saul declare to him, saying, `According to these words hath David spoken.'"
9018025,9,18,25,"And Saul saith, `Thus do ye say to David, There is no delight to the king in dowry, but in a hundred foreskins of the Philistines -- to be avenged on the enemies of the king;' and Saul thought to cause David to fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9018026,9,18,26,"And his servants declare to David these words, and the thing is right in the eyes of David, to be son-in-law to the king; and the days have not been full,"
9018027,9,18,27,"and David riseth and goeth, he and his men, and smiteth among the Philistines two hundred men, and David bringeth in their foreskins, and they set them before the king, to be son-in-law to the king; and Saul giveth to him Michal his daughter for a wife."
9018028,9,18,28,"And Saul seeth and knoweth that Jehovah `is' with David, and Michal daughter of Saul hath loved him,"
9018029,9,18,29,and Saul addeth to be afraid of the presence of David yet; and Saul is an enemy with David all the days.
9018030,9,18,30,"And the princes of the Philistines come out, and it cometh to pass from the time of their coming out, David hath acted more wisely than any of the servants of Saul, and his name is very precious."
9019001,9,19,1,"And Saul speaketh unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, to put David to death,"
9019002,9,19,2,"and Jonathan son of Saul delighted exceedingly in David, and Jonathan declareth to David, saying, `Saul my father is seeking to put thee to death, and, now, take heed, I pray thee, in the morning, and thou hast abode in a secret place, and been hidden,"
9019003,9,19,3,"and I -- I go out, and have stood by the side of my father in the field where thou `art', and I speak of thee unto my father, and have seen what `is coming', and have declared to thee.'"
9019004,9,19,4,"And Jonathan speaketh good of David unto Saul his father, and saith unto him, `Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works for thee `are' very good;"
9019005,9,19,5,"yea, he putteth his life in his hand, and smiteth the Philistine, and Jehovah worketh a great salvation for all Israel; thou hast seen, and dost rejoice, and why dost thou sin against innocent blood, to put David to death for nought?'"
9019006,9,19,6,"And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul sweareth, `Jehovah liveth -- he doth not die.'"
9019007,9,19,7,"And Jonathan calleth for David, and Jonathan declareth to him all these words, and Jonathan bringeth in David unto Saul, and he is before him as heretofore."
9019008,9,19,8,"And there addeth to be war, and David goeth out and fighteth against the Philistines, and smiteth among them -- a great smiting, and they flee from his face."
9019009,9,19,9,"And a spirit of sadness `from' Jehovah is unto Saul, and he is sitting in his house, and his javelin in his hand, and David is playing with the hand,"
9019010,9,19,10,"and Saul seeketh to smite with the javelin through David, and through the wall, and he freeth himself from the presence of Saul, and he smiteth the javelin through the wall; and David hath fled and escapeth during that night."
9019011,9,19,11,"And Saul sendeth messengers unto the house of David to watch him, and to put him to death in the morning; and Michal his wife declareth to David, saying, `If thou art not delivering thy life to-night -- tomorrow thou art put to death.'"
9019012,9,19,12,"And Michal causeth David to go down through the window, and he goeth on, and fleeth, and escapeth;"
9019013,9,19,13,"and Michal taketh the teraphim, and layeth on the bed, and the mattress of goats' `hair' she hath put `for' his pillows, and covereth with a garment."
9019014,9,19,14,"And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and she saith, `He `is' sick.'"
9019015,9,19,15,"And Saul sendeth the messengers to see David, saying, `Bring him up in the bed unto me,' -- to put him to death."
9019016,9,19,16,"And the messengers come in, and lo, the teraphim `are' on the bed, and the mattress of goats' `hair', `for' his pillows."
9019017,9,19,17,"And Saul saith unto Michal, `Why thus hast thou deceived me -- that thou dost send away mine enemy, and he is escaped?' and Michal saith unto Saul, `He said unto me, Send me away: why do I put thee to death?'"
9019018,9,19,18,"And David hath fled, and is escaped, and cometh in unto Samuel to Ramath, and declareth to him all that Saul hath done to him, and he goeth, he and Samuel, and they dwell in Naioth."
9019019,9,19,19,"And it is declared to Saul, saying, `Lo, David `is' in Naioth in Ramah.'"
9019020,9,19,20,"And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and they see the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, set over them, and the Spirit of God is on Saul's messengers, and they prophesy -- they also."
9019021,9,19,21,"And they declare `it' to Saul, and he sendeth other messengers, and they prophesy -- they also; and Saul addeth and sendeth messengers a third time, and they prophesy -- they also."
9019022,9,19,22,"And he goeth -- he also -- to Ramath, and cometh in unto the great well which `is' in Sechu, and asketh, and saith, `Where `are' Samuel and David?' and `one' saith, `Lo, in Naioth in Ramah.'"
9019023,9,19,23,"And he goeth thither -- unto Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God is upon him -- him also; and he goeth, going on, and he prophesyeth till his coming in to Naioth in Ramah,"
9019024,9,19,24,"and he strippeth off -- he also -- his garments, and prophesieth -- he also -- before Samuel, and falleth down naked all that day and all the night; therefore they say, `Is Saul also among the prophets?'"
9020001,9,20,1,"And David fleeth from Naioth in Ramah, and cometh, and saith before Jonathan, `What have I done? what `is' mine iniquity? and what my sin before thy father, that he is seeking my life?'"
9020002,9,20,2,"And he saith to him, `Far be it! thou dost not die; lo, my father doth not do anything great or small and doth not uncover mine ear; and wherefore doth my father hide from me this thing? this `thing' is not.'"
9020003,9,20,3,"And David sweareth again, and saith, `Thy father hath certainly known that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; and yet, Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, but -- as a step between me and death.'"
9020004,9,20,4,"And Jonathan saith to David, `What doth thy soul say? -- and I do it for thee.'"
9020005,9,20,5,"And David saith unto Jonathan, `Lo, the new moon `is' to-morrow; and I do certainly sit with the king to eat; and thou hast sent me away, and I have been hidden in a field till the third evening;"
9020006,9,20,6,"if thy father at all look after me, and thou hast said, David asked earnestly of me to run to Beth-Lehem his city, for a sacrifice of the days `is' there for all the family."
9020007,9,20,7,If thus he say: Good; peace `is' for thy servant; and if it be very displeasing to him -- know that the evil hath been determined by him;
9020008,9,20,8,"and thou hast done kindness, to thy servant, for into a covenant of Jehovah thou hast brought thy servant with thee; -- and if there is in me iniquity, put thou me to death; and unto thy father, why is this -- thou dost bring me in?'"
9020009,9,20,9,"And Jonathan saith, `Far be it from thee! for I certainly do not know that the evil hath been determined by my father to come upon thee, and I do not declare it to thee.'"
9020010,9,20,10,"And David saith unto Jonathan, `Who doth declare to me? or what `if' thy father doth answer thee sharply?'"
9020011,9,20,11,"And Jonathan saith unto David, `Come, and we go out into the field;' and they go out both of them into the field."
9020012,9,20,12,"And Jonathan saith unto David, `Jehovah, God of Israel -- when I search my father, about `this' time to-morrow `or' the third `day', and lo, good `is' towards David, and I do not then send unto thee, and have uncovered thine ear --"
9020013,9,20,13,"thus doth Jehovah do to Jonathan, and thus doth He add; when the evil concerning thee is good to my father, then I have uncovered thine ear, and sent thee away, and thou hast gone in peace, and Jehovah is with thee, as he was with my father;"
9020014,9,20,14,"and not only while I am alive dost thou do with me the kindness of Jehovah, and I die not,"
9020015,9,20,15,"but thou dost not cut off thy kindness from my house unto the age, nor in Jehovah's cutting off the enemies of David, each one from off the face of the ground.'"
9020016,9,20,16,"And Jonathan covenanteth with the house of David, and Jehovah hath sought `it' from the hand of the enemies of David;"
9020017,9,20,17,"and Jonathan addeth to cause David to swear, because he loveth him, for with the love of his own soul he hath loved him."
9020018,9,20,18,"And Jonathan saith to him, `To-morrow `is' new moon, and thou hast been looked after, for thy seat is looked after;"
9020019,9,20,19,"and on the third day thou dost certainly come down, and hast come in unto the place where thou wast hidden in the day of the work, and hast remained near the stone Ezel."
9020020,9,20,20,"`And I shoot three of the arrows at the side, sending out for myself at a mark;"
9020021,9,20,21,"and lo, I send the youth: Go, find the arrows. If I at all say to the youth, Lo, the arrows `are' on this side of thee -- take them, -- then come thou, for peace `is' for thee, and there is nothing; Jehovah liveth."
9020022,9,20,22,"And if thus I say to the young man, Lo, the arrows `are' beyond thee, -- go, for Jehovah hath sent thee away;"
9020023,9,20,23,"as to the thing which we have spoken, I and thou, lo, Jehovah `is' between me and thee -- unto the age.'"
9020024,9,20,24,"And David is hidden in the field, and it is the new moon, and the king sitteth down by the food to eat,"
9020025,9,20,25,"and the king sitteth on his seat, as time by time, on a seat by the wall, and Jonathan riseth, and Abner sitteth at the side of Saul, and David's place is looked after."
9020026,9,20,26,"And Saul hath not spoken anything on that day, for he said, `It `is' an accident; he is not clean -- surely not clean.'"
9020027,9,20,27,"And it cometh to pass on the second morrow of the new moon, that David's place is looked after, and Saul saith unto Jonathan his son, `Wherefore hath the son of Jesse not come in, either yesterday or to-day, unto the food?'"
9020028,9,20,28,"And Jonathan answereth Saul, `David hath been earnestly asked of me unto Beth-Lehem,"
9020029,9,20,29,"and he saith, Send me away, I pray thee, for a family sacrifice we have in the city, and my brother himself hath given command to me, and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren; therefore he hath not come unto the table of the king.'"
9020030,9,20,30,"And the anger of Saul burneth against Jonathan, and he saith to him, `Son of a perverse rebellious woman! have I not known that thou art fixing on the son of Jesse to thy shame, and to the shame of the nakedness of thy mother?"
9020031,9,20,31,"for all the days that the son of Jesse liveth on the ground thou art not established, thou and thy kingdom; and now, send and bring him unto me, for he `is' a son of death.'"
9020032,9,20,32,"And Jonathan answereth Saul his father, and saith unto him, `Why is he put to death? what hath he done?'"
9020033,9,20,33,"And Saul casteth the javelin at him to smite him, and Jonathan knoweth that it hath been determined by his father to put David to death."
9020034,9,20,34,"And Jonathan riseth from the table in the heat of anger, and hath not eaten food on the second day of the new moon, for he hath been grieved for David, for his father put him to shame."
9020035,9,20,35,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that Jonathan goeth out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little youth `is' with him."
9020036,9,20,36,"And he saith to his youth, `Run, find, I pray thee, the arrows which I am shooting;' the youth is running, and he hath shot the arrow, causing `it' to pass over him."
9020037,9,20,37,"And the youth cometh unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan hath shot, and Jonathan calleth after the youth, and saith, `Is not the arrow beyond thee?'"
9020038,9,20,38,"and Jonathan calleth after the youth, `Speed, haste, stand not;' and Jonathan's youth gathereth the arrows, and cometh unto his lord."
9020039,9,20,39,"And the youth hath not known anything, only Jonathan and David knew the word."
9020040,9,20,40,"And Jonathan giveth his weapons unto the youth whom he hath, and saith to him, `Go, carry into the city.'"
9020041,9,20,41,"The youth hath gone, and David hath risen from Ezel, at the south, and falleth on his face to the earth, and boweth himself three times, and they kiss one another, and they weep one with another, till David exerted himself;"
9020042,9,20,42,"and Jonathan saith to David, `Go in peace, in that we have sworn -- we two -- in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah is between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed -- unto the age;' and he riseth and goeth; and Jonathan hath gone in to the city."
9021001,9,21,1,"And David cometh in to Nob, unto Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech trembleth at meeting David, and saith to him, `Wherefore `art' thou thyself alone, and no man with thee?'"
9021002,9,21,2,"And David saith to Ahimelech the priest, `The king hath commanded me a matter, and he saith unto me, Let no man know anything of the matter about which I am sending thee, and which I have commanded thee; and the young men I have caused to know at such and such a place;"
9021003,9,21,3,"and now, what is there under thy hand? five loaves give into my hand, or that which is found.'"
9021004,9,21,4,"And the priest answereth David, and saith, `There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if the youths have been kept only from women.'"
9021005,9,21,5,"And David answereth the priest, and saith to him, `Surely, if women have been restrained from us as heretofore in my going out, then the vessels of the young men are holy, and it `is' a common way: and also, surely to-day it is sanctified in the vessel.'"
9021006,9,21,6,"And the priest giveth to him the holy thing, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which is turned aside from the presence of Jehovah to put hot bread in the day of its being taken away."
9021007,9,21,7,"And there `is' a man of the servants of Saul on that day detained before Jehovah, and his name `is' Doeg the Edomite, chief of the shepherds whom Saul hath."
9021008,9,21,8,"And David saith to Ahimelech, `And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for neither my sword nor my vessels have I taken in my hand, for the matter of the king was urgent.'"
9021009,9,21,9,"And the priest saith, `The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst smite in the valley of Elah, lo, it is wrapt in a garment behind the ephod, if it thou dost take to thyself, take; for there is none other save it in this `place'.' And David saith, `There is none like it -- give it to me.'"
9021010,9,21,10,"And David riseth and fleeth on that day from the face of Saul, and cometh in unto Achish king of Gath;"
9021011,9,21,11,"and the servants of Achish say unto him, `Is not this David king of the land? is it not of this one they sing in dances, saying, `Saul smote among his thousands, and David among his myriads?'"
9021012,9,21,12,"And David layeth these words in his heart, and is exceedingly afraid of the face of Achish king of Gath,"
9021013,9,21,13,"and changeth his behaviour before their eyes, and feigneth himself mad in their hand, and scribbleth on the doors of the gate, and letteth down his spittle unto his beard."
9021014,9,21,14,"And Achish saith unto his servants, `Lo, ye see a man acting as a madman; why do ye bring him in unto me?"
9021015,9,21,15,"A lack of madmen `have' I, that ye have brought in this one to act as a madman by me! doth this one come in unto my house?'"
9022001,9,22,1,"And David goeth thence, and is escaped unto the cave of Adullam, and his brethren hear, and all the house of his father, and go down unto him thither;"
9022002,9,22,2,"and gather themselves unto him do every man in distress, and every man who hath an exactor, and every man bitter in soul, and he is over them for head, and there are with him about four hundred men."
9022003,9,22,3,"And David goeth thence to Mizpeh of Moab, and saith unto the king of Moab, `Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother go out with you, till that I know what God doth for me;'"
9022004,9,22,4,"and he leadeth them before the king of Moab, and they dwell with him all the days of David's being in the fortress."
9022005,9,22,5,"And Gad the prophet saith unto David, `Thou dost not abide in a fortress, go, and thou hast entered for thee the land of Judah;' and David goeth and entereth the forest of Hareth."
9022006,9,22,6,"And Saul heareth that David hath become known, and the men who `are' with him, and Saul is abiding in Gibeah, under the grove in Ramah, and his spear `is' in his hand, and all his servants standing by him."
9022007,9,22,7,"And Saul saith to his servants who are standing by him, `Hear, I pray you, ye Benjamites; also to all of you doth the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards! all of you he doth appoint heads of thousands and heads of hundreds!"
9022008,9,22,8,"for ye have conspired all of you against me, and there is none uncovering mine ear about my son's covenanting with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you grieving for me, and uncovering mine ear, that my son hath raised up my servant against me, to lie in wait as `at' this day.'"
9022009,9,22,9,"And answer doth Doeg the Edomite, who is set over the servants of Saul, and saith, `I have seen the son of Jesse coming in to Nob, unto Ahimelech son of Ahitub,"
9022010,9,22,10,"and he asketh for him at Jehovah, and provision hath given to him, and the sword of Goliath the Philistine hath given to him."
9022011,9,22,11,"And the king sendeth to call Ahimelech son of Ahitub, the priest, and all the house of his father, the priests, who `are' in Nob, and they come all of them unto the king;"
9022012,9,22,12,"and Saul saith, `Hear, I pray thee, son of Ahitub;' and he saith, `Here `am' I, my lord.'"
9022013,9,22,13,"And Saul saith unto him, `Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, by thy giving to him bread and a sword, and to ask for him at God, to rise against me, to lie in wait, as `at' this day?'"
9022014,9,22,14,"And Ahimelech answereth the king and saith, `And who among all thy servants `is' as David -- faithful, and son-in-law of the king, and hath turned aside unto thy council, and is honoured in thy house?"
9022015,9,22,15,"To-day have I begun to ask for him at God? far be it from me! let not the king lay anything against his servant, against any of the house of my father, for thy servant hath known nothing of all this, less or more.'"
9022016,9,22,16,"And the king saith, `Thou dost surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all the house of thy father.'"
9022017,9,22,17,"And the king saith to runners, those standing by him, `Turn round, and put to death the priests of Jehovah, because their hand also `is' with David, and because they have known that he is fleeing, and have not uncovered mine ear;' and the servants of the king have not been willing to put forth their hand to come against the priests of Jehovah."
9022018,9,22,18,"And the king saith to Doeg, `Turn round thou, and come against the priests;' and Doeg the Edomite turneth round, and cometh himself against the priests, and putteth to death in that day eighty and five men bearing a linen ephod,"
9022019,9,22,19,"and Nob, the city of the priests, he hath smitten by the mouth of the sword, from man even unto woman, from infant even unto suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep, by the mouth of the sword."
9022020,9,22,20,"And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, and his name `is' Abiathar, and he fleeth after David,"
9022021,9,22,21,and Abiathar declareth to David that Saul hath slain the priests of Jehovah.
9022022,9,22,22,"And David saith to Abiathar, `I have known on that day when Doeg the Edomite `is' there, that he doth certainly declare `it' to Saul; I have brought `it' round to every person of the house of thy father;"
9022023,9,22,23,dwell with me; fear not; for he who seeketh my life seeketh thy life; for a charge `art' thou with me.'
9023001,9,23,1,"And they declare to David, saying, `Lo, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are spoiling the threshing-floors.'"
9023002,9,23,2,"And David asketh at Jehovah, saying, `Do I go? -- and have I smitten among these Philistines?' And Jehovah saith unto David, `Go, and thou hast smitten among the Philistines, and saved Keilah.'"
9023003,9,23,3,"And David's men say unto him, `Lo, we here in Judah are afraid; and how much more when we go to Keilah, unto the ranks of the Philistines?'"
9023004,9,23,4,"And David addeth again to ask at Jehovah, and Jehovah answereth him, and saith, `Rise, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into thy hand.'"
9023005,9,23,5,"And David goeth, and his men, to Keilah, and fighteth with the Philistines, and leadeth away their cattle, and smiteth among them -- a great smiting, and David saveth the inhabitants of Keilah."
9023006,9,23,6,"And it cometh to pass, in the fleeing of Abiathar son of Ahimelech unto David, to Keilah, an ephod came down in his hand."
9023007,9,23,7,"And it is declared to Saul that David hath come in to Keilah, and Saul saith, `God hath made him known for my hand, for he hath been shut in, to enter into a city of doors and bar.'"
9023008,9,23,8,"And Saul summoneth the whole of the people to battle, to go down to Keilah, to lay siege unto David and unto his men."
9023009,9,23,9,"And David knoweth that against him Saul is devising the evil, and saith unto Abiathar the priest, `Bring nigh the ephod.'"
9023010,9,23,10,"And David saith, `Jehovah, God of Israel, Thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul is seeking to come in unto Keilah, to destroy the city on mine account."
9023011,9,23,11,"Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up into his hand? doth Saul come down as Thy servant hath heard? Jehovah, God of Israel, declare, I pray Thee, to Thy servant.' And Jehovah saith, `He doth come down.'"
9023012,9,23,12,"And David saith, `Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up, and my men, into the hand of Saul?' And Jehovah saith, `They shut `thee' up.'"
9023013,9,23,13,"And David riseth -- and his men -- about six hundred men, and they go out from Keilah, and go up and down where they go up and down; and to Saul it hath been declared that David hath escaped from Keilah, and he ceaseth to go out."
9023014,9,23,14,"And David abideth in the wilderness, in fortresses, and abideth in the hill-country, in the wilderness of Ziph; and Saul seeketh him all the days, and God hath not given him into his hand."
9023015,9,23,15,"And David seeth that Saul hath come out to seek his life, and David `is' in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest."
9023016,9,23,16,"And Jonathan son of Saul riseth, and goeth unto David to the forest, and strengtheneth his hand in God,"
9023017,9,23,17,"and saith unto him, `Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father doth not find thee, and thou dost reign over Israel, and I am to thee for second, and also so knoweth Saul my father.'"
9023018,9,23,18,"And they make a covenant both of them before Jehovah; and David abideth in the forest, and Jonathan hath gone to his house."
9023019,9,23,19,"And the Ziphites go up unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, `Is not David hiding himself with us in fortresses, in the forest, in the height of Hachilah, which `is' on the south of the desolate place?"
9023020,9,23,20,"And, now, by all the desire of thy soul, O king, to come down, come down, and ours `is' to shut him up into the hand of the king.'"
9023021,9,23,21,"And Saul saith, `Blessed `are' ye of Jehovah, for ye have pity on me;"
9023022,9,23,22,"go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his foot is; who hath seen him there? for `one' hath said unto me, He is very subtile."
9023023,9,23,23,"And see and know of all the hiding-places where he hideth himself, and ye have turned back unto me prepared, and I have gone with you, and it hath been, if he is in the land, that I have searched him out through all the thousands of Judah.'"
9023024,9,23,24,"And they rise and go to Ziph before Saul, and David and his men `are' in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain, at the south of the desolate place."
9023025,9,23,25,"And Saul and his men go to seek, and they declare to David, and he goeth down the rock, and abideth in the wilderness of Maon; and Saul heareth, and pursueth after David `to' the wilderness of Maon."
9023026,9,23,26,"And Saul goeth on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain, and David is hastened to go from the face of Saul, and Saul and his men are compassing David and his men, to catch them."
9023027,9,23,27,"And a messenger hath come in unto Saul, saying, `Haste, and come, for the Philistines have pushed against the land.'"
9023028,9,23,28,"And Saul turneth back from pursuing after David, and goeth to meet the Philistines, therefore they have called that place `The Rock of Divisions.'"
9023029,9,23,29,"And David goeth up thence, and abideth in fortresses `at' En-gedi."
9024001,9,24,1,"And it cometh to pass when Saul hath turned back from after the Philistines, that they declare to him, saying, `Lo, David `is' in the wilderness of En-gedi.'"
9024002,9,24,2,"And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of the rocks of the wild goats,"
9024003,9,24,3,"and he cometh in unto folds of the flock, on the way, and there `is' a cave, and Saul goeth in to cover his feet; and David and his men in the sides of the cave are abiding."
9024004,9,24,4,"And the men of David say unto him, `Lo, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Lo, I am giving thine enemy into thy hand, and thou hast done to him as it is good in thine eyes;' and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe which `is' on Saul -- gently."
9024005,9,24,5,"And it cometh to pass afterwards that the heart of David smiteth him, because that he hath cut off the skirt which `is' on Saul,"
9024006,9,24,6,"and he saith to his men, `Far be it from me, by Jehovah; I do not do this thing to my lord -- to the anointed of Jehovah -- to put forth my hand against him, for the anointed of Jehovah he `is'.'"
9024007,9,24,7,"And David subdueth his men by words, and hath not permitted them to rise against Saul; and Saul hath risen from the cave, and goeth on the way;"
9024008,9,24,8,"and David riseth afterwards, and goeth out from the cave, and calleth after Saul, saying, `My lord, O king!' And Saul looketh attentively behind him, and David boweth -- face to the earth -- and doth obeisance."
9024009,9,24,9,"And David saith to Saul, `Why dost thou hear the words of man, saying, Lo, David is seeking thine evil?"
9024010,9,24,10,"Lo, this day have thine eyes seen how that Jehovah hath given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and `one' said to slay thee, and `mine eye' hath pity on thee, and I say, I do not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of Jehovah he `is'."
9024011,9,24,11,"`And, my father, see, yea see the skirt of thine upper robe in my hand; for by cutting off the skirt of thy upper robe, and I have not slain thee, know and see that there is not in my hand evil and transgression, and I have not sinned against thee, and thou art hunting my soul to take it!"
9024012,9,24,12,"`Jehovah doth judge between me and thee, and Jehovah hath avenged me of thee, and my hand is not on thee;"
9024013,9,24,13,"as saith the simile of the ancients, From the wicked goeth out wickedness, and my hand is not on thee."
9024014,9,24,14,`After whom hath the king of Israel come out? after whom art thou pursuing? -- after a dead dog! after one flea!
9024015,9,24,15,"And Jehovah hath been for judge, and hath judged between me and thee, yea, he seeth and pleadeth my cause, and doth deliver me out of thy hand.'"
9024016,9,24,16,"And it cometh to pass, when David completeth to speak these words unto Saul, that Saul saith, `Is this thy voice, my son David?' and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth."
9024017,9,24,17,"And he saith unto David, `More righteous thou `art' than I; for thou hast done me good, and I have done thee evil;"
9024018,9,24,18,"and thou hast declared to-day how that thou hast done good with me, how that Jehovah shut me up into thy hand, and thou didst not slay me,"
9024019,9,24,19,"and that a man doth find his enemy, and hath sent him away in a good manner; and Jehovah doth repay thee good for that which thou didst to me this day."
9024020,9,24,20,"`And, now, lo, I have known that thou dost certainly reign, and the kingdom of Israel hath stood in thy hand;"
9024021,9,24,21,"and, now, swear to me by Jehovah -- thou dost not cut off my seed after me, nor dost thou destroy my name from the house of my father.'"
9024022,9,24,22,"And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul goeth unto his house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress."
9025001,9,25,1,"And Samuel dieth, and all Israel are gathered, and mourn for him, and bury him in his house, in Ramah; and David riseth and goeth down unto the wilderness of Paran."
9025002,9,25,2,"And `there is' a man in Maon, and his work `is' in Carmel; and the man `is' very great, and he hath three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats; and he is shearing his flock in Carmel."
9025003,9,25,3,"And the name of the man `is' Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail, and the woman `is' of good understanding, and of fair form, and the man `is' hard and evil `in' doings; and he `is' a Calebite."
9025004,9,25,4,"And David heareth in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing his flock,"
9025005,9,25,5,"and David sendeth ten young men, and David saith to the young men, `Go ye up to Carmel, and ye have come in unto Nabal, and asked of him in my name of welfare,"
9025006,9,25,6,"and said thus: To life! and thou, peace; and thy house, peace; and all that thou hast -- peace!"
9025007,9,25,7,"and, now, I have heard that thou hast shearers; now, the shepherds whom thou hast have been with us, we have not put them to shame, nor hath anything been looked after by them, all the days of their being in Carmel."
9025008,9,25,8,"`Ask thy young men, and they declare to thee, and the young men find grace in thine eyes, for on a good day we have come; give, I pray thee, that which thy hand findeth, to thy servants, and to thy son, to David.'"
9025009,9,25,9,"And the young men of David come in, and speak unto Nabal according to all these words, in the name of David -- and rest."
9025010,9,25,10,"And Nabal answereth the servants of David and saith, `Who `is' David, and who the son of Jesse? to-day have servants been multiplied who are breaking away each from his master;"
9025011,9,25,11,"and I have taken my bread, and my water, and my flesh, which I slaughtered for my shearers, and have given `it' to men whom I have not known whence they `are'!'"
9025012,9,25,12,"And the young men of David turn on their way, and turn back, and come in, and declare to him according to all these words."
9025013,9,25,13,"And David saith to his men, `Gird ye on each his sword;' and they gird on each his sword, and David also girdeth on his sword, and there go up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred have remained by the vessels."
9025014,9,25,14,"And to Abigail wife of Nabal hath one young man of the youths declared, saying, `Lo, David hath sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our lord, and he flieth upon them;"
9025015,9,25,15,"and the men `are' very good to us, and have not put us to shame, and we have not looked after anything all the days we have gone up and down with them, in our being in the field;"
9025016,9,25,16,"a wall they have been unto us both by night and by day, all the days of our being with them, feeding the flock."
9025017,9,25,17,"`And, now, know and consider what thou dost; for evil hath been determined against our lord, and against all his house, and he `is' too much a son of worthlessness to be spoken to.'"
9025018,9,25,18,"And Abigail hasteth, and taketh two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep, prepared, and five measures of roasted corn, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred bunches of figs, and setteth `them' on the asses."
9025019,9,25,19,"And she saith to her young men, `Pass over before me; lo, after you I am coming;' and to her husband Nabal she hath not declared `it';"
9025020,9,25,20,"and it hath come to pass, she is riding on the ass and is coming down in the secret part of the hill-country, and lo, David and his men are coming down to meet her, and she meeteth them."
9025021,9,25,21,"And David said, `Only, in vain I have kept all that this `one' hath in the wilderness, and nothing hath been looked after of all that he hath, and he turneth back to me evil for good;"
9025022,9,25,22,"thus doth God do to the enemies of David, and thus He doth add, if I leave of all that he hath till the light of the morning -- of those sitting on the wall.'"
9025023,9,25,23,"And Abigail seeth David, and hasteth and cometh down from off the ass, and falleth before David on her face, and boweth herself to the earth,"
9025024,9,25,24,"and falleth at his feet and saith, `On me, my lord, the iniquity; and let, I pray thee, thy handmaid speak in thine ear, and hear the words of thy handmaid."
9025025,9,25,25,"`Let not, I pray thee, my lord set his heart to this man of worthlessness, on Nabal, for as his name `is' so `is' he; Nabal `is' his name, and folly `is' with him; and I, thine handmaid, did not see the young men of my lord whom thou didst send;"
9025026,9,25,26,"and now, my lord, Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, in that Jehovah hath withheld thee from coming in with blood, and to save thy hand to thee -- now let thine enemies be as Nabal, even those seeking evil unto my lord."
9025027,9,25,27,"`And, now, this blessing which thy maid-servant hath brought to my lord -- it hath been given to the young men who are going up and down at the feet of my lord."
9025028,9,25,28,"`Bear, I pray thee, with the transgression of thy handmaid, for Jehovah doth certainly make to my lord a stedfast house; for the battles of Jehovah hath my lord fought, and evil is not found in thee `all' thy days."
9025029,9,25,29,"And man riseth to pursue thee and to seek thy soul, and the soul of my lord hath been bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; as to the soul of thine enemies, He doth sling them out in the midst of the hollow of the sling."
9025030,9,25,30,"`And it hath been, when Jehovah doth to my lord according to all the good which He hath spoken concerning thee, and appointed thee for leader over Israel,"
9025031,9,25,31,"that this is not to thee for a stumbling-block, and for an offence of heart to my lord -- either to shed blood for nought, or my lord's restraining himself; and Jehovah hath done good to my lord, and thou hast remembered thy handmaid.'"
9025032,9,25,32,"And David saith to Abigail, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath sent thee this day to meet me,"
9025033,9,25,33,"and blessed `is' thy discretion, and blessed `art' thou in that thou hast restrained me this day from coming in with blood, and to restrain my hand to myself."
9025034,9,25,34,"And yet, Jehovah liveth, God of Israel, who hath kept me back from doing evil with thee, for unless thou hadst hasted, and dost come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal till the light of the morning, of those sitting on the wall.'"
9025035,9,25,35,"And David receiveth from her hand that which she hath brought to him, and to her he hath said, `Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accept thy face.'"
9025036,9,25,36,"And Abigail cometh in unto Nabal, and lo, he hath a banquet in his house, like a banquet of the king, and the heart of Nabal `is' glad within him, and he `is' drunk unto excess, and she hath not declared to him anything, less or more, till the light of the morning."
9025037,9,25,37,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, when the wine is gone out from Nabal, that his wife declareth to him these things, and his heart dieth within him, and he hath been as a stone."
9025038,9,25,38,"And it cometh to pass, `in' about ten days, that Jehovah smiteth Nabal, and he dieth,"
9025039,9,25,39,"and David heareth that Nabal `is' dead, and saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and His servant hath kept back from evil, and the wickedness of Nabal hath Jehovah turned back on his own head;' and David sendeth and speaketh with Abigail, to take her to him for a wife."
9025040,9,25,40,"And the servants of David come in unto Abigail at Carmel, and speak unto her, saying, `David hath sent us unto thee to take thee to him for a wife.'"
9025041,9,25,41,"And she riseth and boweth herself -- face to the earth -- and saith, `Lo, thy handmaid `is' for a maid-servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.'"
9025042,9,25,42,"And Abigail hasteth and riseth, and rideth on the ass; and five of her young women who are going at her feet; and she goeth after the messengers of David, and is to him for a wife."
9025043,9,25,43,"And Ahinoam hath David taken from Jezreel, and they are -- even both of them -- to him for wives;"
9025044,9,25,44,"and Saul gave Michal his daughter, wife to David, to Phalti son of Laish, who `is' of Gallim."
9026001,9,26,1,"And the Ziphites come in unto Saul, at Gibeah, saying, `Is not David hiding himself in the height of Hachilah, on the front of the desert?'"
9026002,9,26,2,"And Saul riseth, and goeth down unto the wilderness of Ziph, and with him three thousand men, chosen ones of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9026003,9,26,3,"And Saul encampeth in the height of Hachilah, which `is' on the front of the desert, by the way, and David is abiding in the wilderness, and he seeth that Saul hath come after him in to the wilderness;"
9026004,9,26,4,"and David sendeth spies, and knoweth that Saul hath come unto Nachon,"
9026005,9,26,5,"and David riseth, and cometh in unto the place where Saul hath encamped, and David seeth the place where Saul hath lain, and Abner son of Ner, head of his host, and Saul is lying in the path, and the people are encamping round about him."
9026006,9,26,6,"And David answereth and saith unto Ahimelech the Hittite, and unto Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, `Who doth go down with me unto Saul, unto the camp?' and Abishai saith, `I -- I go down with thee.'"
9026007,9,26,7,"And David cometh -- and Abishai -- unto the people by night, and lo, Saul is lying sleeping in the path, and his spear struck into the earth at his pillow, and abner and the people are lying round about him."
9026008,9,26,8,"And Abishai saith unto David, `God hath shut up to-day thine enemy into thy hand; and, now, let me smite him, I pray thee, with a spear, even into the earth at once -- and I do repeat `it' to him.'"
9026009,9,26,9,"And David saith unto Abishai, `Destroy him not; for who hath put forth his hand against the anointed of Jehovah, and been acquitted?'"
9026010,9,26,10,"And David saith, `Jehovah liveth; except Jehovah doth smite him, or his day come that he hath died, or into battle he go down, and hath been consumed --"
9026011,9,26,11,"far be it from me, by Jehovah, from putting forth my hand against the anointed of Jehovah; and, now, take, I pray thee, the spear which `is' at his pillow, and the cruse of water, and we go away.'"
9026012,9,26,12,"And David taketh the spear, and the cruse of water at the pillow of Saul, and they go away, and there is none seeing, and there is none knowing, and there is none awaking, for all of them are sleeping, for a deep sleep `from' Jehovah hath fallen upon them."
9026013,9,26,13,"And David passeth over to the other side, and standeth on the top of the hill afar off -- great `is' the place between them;"
9026014,9,26,14,"and David calleth unto the people, and unto Abner son of Ner, saying, `Dost thou not answer, Abner?' and Abner answereth and saith, `Who `art' thou `who' hast called unto the king?'"
9026015,9,26,15,"And David saith unto Abner, `Art not thou a man? and who `is' like thee in Israel? but why hast thou not watched over thy lord the king? for one of the people had come in to destroy the king, thy lord."
9026016,9,26,16,"Not good is this thing which thou hast done; Jehovah liveth, but ye `are' sons of death, in that ye have not watched over your lord, over the anointed of Jehovah; and now, see where the king's spear `is', and the cruse of water which `is' at his bolster.'"
9026017,9,26,17,"And Saul discerneth the voice of David, and saith, `Is this thy voice, my son David?' and David saith, `My voice, my lord, O king!'"
9026018,9,26,18,"and he saith, `Why `is' this -- my lord is pursuing after his servant? for what have I done, and what `is' in my hand evil?"
9026019,9,26,19,"And, now, let, I pray thee, my lord the king hear the words of his servant: if Jehovah hath moved thee against me, let Him accept a present; and if the sons of men -- cursed `are' they before Jehovah, for they have cast me out to-day from being admitted into the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods."
9026020,9,26,20,"`And now, let not my blood fall to the earth over-against the face of Jehovah, for the king of Israel hath come out to seek one flea, as `one' pursueth the partridge in mountains.'"
9026021,9,26,21,"And Saul saith, `I have sinned; turn back, my son David, for I do evil to thee no more, because that my soul hath been precious in thine eyes this day; lo, I have acted foolishly, and do err very greatly.'"
9026022,9,26,22,"And David answereth and saith, `Lo, the king's spear; and let one of the young men pass over, and receive it;"
9026023,9,26,23,"and Jehovah doth turn back to each his righteousness and his faithfulness, in that Jehovah hath given thee to-day into `my' hand, and I have not been willing to put forth my hand against the anointed of Jehovah,"
9026024,9,26,24,"and lo, as thy soul hath been great this day in mine eyes, so is my soul great in the eyes of Jehovah, and He doth deliver me out of all distress.'"
9026025,9,26,25,"And Saul saith unto David, `Blessed `art' thou, my son David, also working thou dost work, and also prevailing thou dost prevail.' And David goeth on his way, and Saul hath turned back to his place."
9027001,9,27,1,"And David saith unto his heart, `Now am I consumed one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing for me better than that I diligently escape unto the land of the Philistines, and Saul hath been despairing of me -- of seeking me any more in all the border of Israel, and I have escaped out of his hand.'"
9027002,9,27,2,"And David riseth, and passeth over, he and six hundred men who `are' with him, unto Achish son of Maoch king of Gath;"
9027003,9,27,3,"and David dwelleth with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each one with his household, `even' David and his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelitess."
9027004,9,27,4,"And it is declared to Saul that David hath fled to Gath, and he hath not added any more to seek him."
9027005,9,27,5,"And David saith unto Achish, `If, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, they give to me a place in one of the cities of the field, and I dwell there, yea, why doth thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?'"
9027006,9,27,6,"And Achish giveth to him in that day Ziklag, therefore hath Ziklag been to the kings of Judah till this day."
9027007,9,27,7,And the number of the days which David hath dwelt in the field of the Philistines `is' days and four months;
9027008,9,27,8,"and David goeth up and his men, and they push unto the Geshurite, and the Gerizite, and the Amalekite, (for they are inhabitants of the land from of old), as thou comest in to Shur and unto the land of Egypt,"
9027009,9,27,9,"and David hath smitten the land, and doth not keep alive man and woman, and hath taken sheep, and oxen, and asses, and camels, and garments, and turneth back, and cometh in unto Achish."
9027010,9,27,10,"And Achish saith, `Whither have ye pushed to-day?' and David saith, `Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelite, and unto the south of the Kenite.'"
9027011,9,27,11,"Neither man nor woman doth David keep alive, to bring in `word' to Gath, saying, `Lest they declare `it' against us, saying, Thus hath David done, and thus `is' his custom all the days that he hath dwelt in the fields of the Philistines.'"
9027012,9,27,12,"And Achish believeth in David, saying, `He hath made himself utterly abhorred among his people, in Israel, and hath been to me for a servant age-during.'"
9028001,9,28,1,"And it cometh to pass in those days, that the Philistines gather their camps for the war, to fight against Israel, and Achish saith unto David, `Thou dost certainly know that with me thou dost go out into the camp, thou and thy men.'"
9028002,9,28,2,"And David saith unto Achish, `Therefore -- thou dost know that which thy servant dost do.' And Achish saith unto David, `Therefore -- keeper of my head I do appoint thee all the days.'"
9028003,9,28,3,"And Samuel hath died, and all Israel mourn for him, and bury him in Ramah, even in his city, and Saul hath turned aside those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
9028004,9,28,4,"And the Philistines are gathered, and come in, and encamp in Shunem, and Saul gathereth all Israel, and they encamp in Gilboa,"
9028005,9,28,5,"and Saul seeth the camp of the Philistines, and feareth, and his heart trembleth greatly,"
9028006,9,28,6,"and Saul asketh at Jehovah, and Jehovah hath not answered him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets."
9028007,9,28,7,"And Saul saith to his servants, `Seek for me a woman possessing a familiar spirit, and I go unto her, and inquire of her;' and his servants say unto him, `Lo, a woman possessing a familiar spirit in En-dor.'"
9028008,9,28,8,"And Saul disguiseth himself and putteth on other garments, and goeth, he and two of the men with him, and they come in unto the woman by night, and he saith, `Divine, I pray thee, to me by the familiar spirit, and cause to come up to me him whom I say unto thee.'"
9028009,9,28,9,"And the woman saith unto him, `Lo, thou hast known that which Saul hath done, that he hath cut off those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; and why art thou laying a snare for my soul -- to put me to death?'"
9028010,9,28,10,"And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah, saying, `Jehovah liveth, punishment doth not meet thee for this thing.'"
9028011,9,28,11,"And the woman saith, `Whom do I bring up to thee?' and he saith, `Samuel -- bring up to me.'"
9028012,9,28,12,"And the woman seeth Samuel, and crieth with a loud voice, and the woman speaketh unto Saul, saying, `Why hast thou deceived me -- and thou Saul?'"
9028013,9,28,13,"And the king saith to her, `Do not fear; for what hast thou seen?' and the woman saith unto Saul, `Gods I have seen coming up out of the earth.'"
9028014,9,28,14,"And he saith to her, `What `is' his form?' and she saith, `An aged man is coming up, and he `is' covered with an upper robe;' and Saul knoweth that he `is' Samuel, and boweth -- face to thee earth -- and doth obeisance."
9028015,9,28,15,"And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Why hast thou troubled me, to bring me up?' And Saul saith, `I have great distress, and the Philistines are fighting against me, God hath turned aside from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the hand of the prophets, or by dreams; and I call for thee to let me know what I do.'"
9028016,9,28,16,"And Samuel saith, `And why dost thou ask me, and Jehovah hath turned aside from thee, and is thine enemy?"
9028017,9,28,17,"And Jehovah doth for Himself as He hath spoken by my hand, and Jehovah rendeth the kingdom out of thy hand, and giveth it to thy neighbour -- to David."
9028018,9,28,18,"Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, nor didst the fierceness of His anger on Amalek -- therefore this thing hath Jehovah done to thee this day;"
9028019,9,28,19,"yea, Jehovah giveth also Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons `are' with me; also the camp of Israel doth Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.'"
9028020,9,28,20,"And Saul hasteth and falleth -- the fulness of his stature -- to the earth, and feareth greatly because of the words of Samuel; also power was not in him, for he had not eaten bread all the day, and all the night."
9028021,9,28,21,"And the woman cometh in unto Saul, and seeth that he hath been greatly troubled, and saith unto him, `Lo, thy maid-servant hath hearkened to thy voice, and I put my soul in my hand, and I obey thy words which thou hast spoken unto me;"
9028022,9,28,22,"and now, hearken, I pray thee, also thou, to the voice of thy maid-servant, and I set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and there is in thee power when thou goest in the way.'"
9028023,9,28,23,"And he refuseth, and saith, `I do not eat;' and his servants urge on him, and also the woman, and he hearkeneth to their voice, and riseth from the earth, and sitteth on the bed."
9028024,9,28,24,"And the woman hath a calf of the stall in the house, and she hasteth and slaughtereth it, and taketh flour, and kneadeth, and baketh it unleavened things,"
9028025,9,28,25,"and bringeth nigh before Saul, and before his servants, and they eat, and rise, and go on, during that night."
9029001,9,29,1,"And the Philistines gather all their camps to Aphek, and the Israelites are encamping at a fountain which `is' in Jezreel,"
9029002,9,29,2,"and the princes of the Philistines are passing on by hundreds, and by thousands, and David and his men are passing on in the rear with Achish."
9029003,9,29,3,"And the heads of the Philistines say, `What `are' these Hebrews?' and Achish saith unto the heads of the Philistines, `Is not this David servant of Saul king of Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have not found in him anything `wrong' from the day of his falling away till this day.'"
9029004,9,29,4,"And the heads of the Philistines are wroth against him, and the heads of the Philistines say to him, `Send back the man, and he doth turn back unto his place whither thou hast appointed him, and doth not go down with us into battle, and is not to us for an adversary in battle; and wherewith doth this one reconcile himself unto his lord -- is it not with the heads of those men?'"
9029005,9,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they answer in choruses, saying, Saul hath smitten among his thousands, and David among his myriads?'"
9029006,9,29,6,"And Achish calleth unto David, and saith unto him, `Jehovah liveth, surely thou `art' upright, and good in mine eyes is thy going out, and thy coming in, with me in the camp, for I have not found in thee evil from the day of thy coming in unto me till this day; and in the eyes of the princes thou art not good;"
9029007,9,29,7,"and now, turn back, and go in peace, and thou dost do no evil in the eyes of the princes of the Philistines.'"
9029008,9,29,8,"And David saith unto Achish, `But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the day that I have been before thee till this day -- that I go not in and have fought against the enemies of my lord the king?'"
9029009,9,29,9,"And Achish answereth and saith unto David, `I have known that thou `art' good in mine eyes as a messenger of God; only, the princes of the Philistines have said, He doth not go up with us into battle;"
9029010,9,29,10,"and now, rise thou early in the morning, and the servants of thy lord who have come with thee, when ye have risen early in the morning, and have light, then go ye.'"
9029011,9,29,11,"And David riseth early, he and his men, to go in the morning, to turn back unto the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines have gone up to Jezreel."
9030001,9,30,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the coming in of David and his men to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites have pushed unto the south, and unto Ziklag, and smite Ziklag, and burn it with fire,"
9030002,9,30,2,"and they take captive the women who `are' in it; from small unto great they have not put any one to death, and they lead away, and go on their way."
9030003,9,30,3,"And David cometh in -- and his men -- unto the city, and lo, burnt with fire, and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters have been taken captive!"
9030004,9,30,4,"And David lifteth up -- and the people who `are' with him -- their voice and weep, till that they have no power to weep."
9030005,9,30,5,"And the two wives of David have been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;"
9030006,9,30,6,"and David hath great distress, for the people have said to stone him, for the soul of all the people hath been bitter, each for his sons and for his daughters; and David doth strengthen himself in Jehovah his God."
9030007,9,30,7,"And David saith unto Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, `Bring nigh, I pray thee, to me the ephod;' and Abiathar bringeth nigh the ephod unto David,"
9030008,9,30,8,"and David asketh at Jehovah, saying, `I pursue after this troop -- do I overtake it?' And He saith to him, `Pursue, for thou dost certainly overtake, and dost certainly deliver.'"
9030009,9,30,9,"And David goeth on, he and six hundred men who `are' with him, and they come in unto the brook of Besor, and those left have stood still,"
9030010,9,30,10,"and David pursueth, he and four hundred men, (and two hundred men stand still who have been too faint to pass over the brook of Besor),"
9030011,9,30,11,"and they find a man, an Egyptian, in the field, and take him unto David, and give to him bread, and he eateth, and they cause him to drink water,"
9030012,9,30,12,"and give to him a piece of a bunch of dried figs, and two bunches of raisins, and he eateth, and his spirit returneth unto him, for he hath not eaten bread nor drunk water three days and three nights."
9030013,9,30,13,"And David saith to him, `Whose `art' thou? and whence `art' thou?' And he saith, `An Egyptian youth I `am', servant to a man, an Amalekite, and my lord forsaketh me, for I have been sick three days,"
9030014,9,30,14,"we pushed `to' the south of the Cherethite, and against that which `is' to Judah, and against the south of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned with fire.'"
9030015,9,30,15,"And David saith unto him, `Dost thou bring me down unto this troop?' and he saith, `Swear to me by God -- thou dost not put me to death, nor dost thou shut me up into the hand of my lord -- and I bring thee down unto this troop.'"
9030016,9,30,16,"And he bringeth him down, and lo, they are spread out over the face of all the earth, eating, and drinking, and feasting, with all the great spoil which they have taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
9030017,9,30,17,"And David smiteth them from the twilight even unto the evening of the morrow, and there hath not escaped of them a man, except four hundred young men who have ridden on the camels, and are fled."
9030018,9,30,18,And David delivereth all that the Amalekites have taken; also his two wives hath David delivered.
9030019,9,30,19,"And there hath not lacked to them `anything', from small unto great, and unto sons and daughters, and from the spoil, even unto all that they had taken to themselves, the whole hath David brought back,"
9030020,9,30,20,"and David taketh the whole of the flock, and of the herd, they have led on before these cattle, and they say, `This `is' David's spoil.'"
9030021,9,30,21,"And David cometh in unto the two hundred men who were too faint to go after David, and whom they cause to abide at the brook of Besor, and they go out to meet David, and to meet the people who `are' with him, and David approacheth the people, and asketh of them of welfare."
9030022,9,30,22,"And every bad and worthless man, of the men who have gone with David, answereth, yea, they say, `Because that they have not gone with us we do not give to them of the spoil which we have delivered, except each his wife and his children, and they lead away and go."
9030023,9,30,23,"And David saith, `Ye do not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given to us, and He doth preserve us, and doth give the troop which cometh against us into our hand;"
9030024,9,30,24,"and who doth hearken to you in this thing? for as the portion of him who was brought down into battle, so also `is' the portion of him who is abiding by the vessels -- alike they share.'"
9030025,9,30,25,"And it cometh to pass from that day and forward, that he appointeth it for a statute and for an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
9030026,9,30,26,"And David cometh in unto Ziklag, and sendeth of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, (saying, `Lo, for you a blessing, of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah),'"
9030027,9,30,27,"to those in Beth-El, and to those in South Ramoth, and to those in Jattir,"
9030028,9,30,28,"and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,"
9030029,9,30,29,"and to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,"
9030030,9,30,30,"and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-Ashan, and to those in Athach,"
9030031,9,30,31,"and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David had gone up and down, he and his men."
9031001,9,31,1,"And the Philistines are fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel flee from the face of the Philistines, and fall wounded in mount Gilboa,"
9031002,9,31,2,"and the Philistines follow Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, sons of Saul."
9031003,9,31,3,"And the battle is hard against Saul, and the archers find him -- men with bow -- and he is pained greatly by the archers;"
9031004,9,31,4,"and Saul saith to the bearer of his weapons, `Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest they come -- these uncircumcised -- and have pierced me, and rolled themselves on me;' and the bearer of his weapons hath not been willing, for he is greatly afraid, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it."
9031005,9,31,5,"And the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul `is' dead, and he falleth -- he also -- on his sword, and dieth with him;"
9031006,9,31,6,"and Saul dieth, and three of his sons, and the bearer of his weapons, also all his men, on that day together."
9031007,9,31,7,"And they see -- the men of Israel, who `are' beyond the valley, and who `are' beyond the Jordan -- that the men of Israel have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake the cities and flee, and Philistines come in, and dwell in them."
9031008,9,31,8,"And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa,"
9031009,9,31,9,"and they cut off his head, and strip off his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim tidings `in' the house of their idols, and `among' the people;"
9031010,9,31,10,"and they place his weapons `in' the house of Ashtaroth, and his body they have fixed on the wall of Beth-Shan."
9031011,9,31,11,"And they hear regarding it -- the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead -- that which the Philistines have done to Saul,"
9031012,9,31,12,"and all the men of valour arise, and go all the night, and take the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Beth-Shan, and come in to Jabesh, and burn them there,"
9031013,9,31,13,"and they take their bones, and bury `them' under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and fast seven days."
10001001,10,1,1,"And it cometh to pass, after the death of Saul, that David hath returned from smiting the Amalekite, and David dwelleth in Ziklag two days,"
10001002,10,1,2,"and it cometh to pass, on the third day, that lo, a man hath come in out of the camp from Saul, and his garments `are' rent, and earth on his head; and it cometh to pass, in his coming in unto David, that he falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance."
10001003,10,1,3,"And David saith to him, `Whence comest thou?' and he saith unto him, `Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.'"
10001004,10,1,4,"And David saith unto him, `What hath been the matter? declare, I pray thee, to me.' And he saith, that `The people hath fled from the battle, and also a multitude hath fallen of the people, and they die; and also Saul and Jonathan his son have died.'"
10001005,10,1,5,"And David saith unto the youth who is declaring `it' to him, `How hast thou known that Saul and Jonathan his son `are' dead?'"
10001006,10,1,6,"And the youth who is declaring `it' to him saith, I happened to meet in mount Gilboa, and lo, Saul is leaning on his spear; and lo, the chariots and those possessing horses have followed him;"
10001007,10,1,7,"and he turneth behind him, and seeth me, and calleth unto me, and I say, Here `am' I."
10001008,10,1,8,"And he saith to me, Who `art' thou? and I say unto him, An Amalekite I `am'.'"
10001009,10,1,9,"`And he saith unto me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and put me to death, for seized me hath the arrow, for all my soul `is' still in me."
10001010,10,1,10,"And I stand over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he doth not live after his falling, and I take the crown which `is' on his head, and the bracelet which `is' on his arm, and bring them in unto my lord hither.'"
10001011,10,1,11,"And David taketh hold on his garments, and rendeth them, and also all the men who `are' with him,"
10001012,10,1,12,"and they mourn, and weep, and fast till the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they have fallen by the sword."
10001013,10,1,13,"And David saith unto the youth who is declaring `it' to him, `Whence `art' thou?' and he saith, `Son of a sojourner, an Amalekite, I `am'.'"
10001014,10,1,14,"And David saith unto him, `How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?'"
10001015,10,1,15,"And David calleth to one of the youths, and saith, `Draw nigh -- fall upon him;' and he smiteth him, and he dieth;"
10001016,10,1,16,"and David saith unto him, `Thy blood `is' on thine own head, for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I -- I put to death the anointed of Jehovah.'"
10001017,10,1,17,"And David lamenteth with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son;"
10001018,10,1,18,"and he saith to teach the sons of Judah `The Bow;' lo, it is written on the book of the Upright: --"
10001019,10,1,19,"`The Roebuck, O Israel, On thy high places `is' wounded; How have the mighty fallen!"
10001020,10,1,20,"Declare `it' not in Gath, Proclaim not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon, Lest they rejoice -- The daughters of the Philistines, Lest they exult -- The daughters of the Uncircumcised!"
10001021,10,1,21,"Mountains of Gilboa! No dew nor rain be on you, And fields of heave-offerings! For there hath become loathsome The shield of the mighty, The shield of Saul -- without the anointed with oil."
10001022,10,1,22,"From the blood of the wounded, From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan Hath not turned backward; And the sword of Saul doth not return empty."
10001023,10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan! They are loved and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they have not been parted. Than eagles they have been lighter, Than lions they have been mightier!"
10001024,10,1,24,"Daughters of Israel! for Saul weep ye, Who is clothing you `in' scarlet with delights. Who is lifting up ornaments of gold on your clothing."
10001025,10,1,25,How have the mighty fallen In the midst of the battle! Jonathan! on thy high places wounded!
10001026,10,1,26,"I am in distress for thee, my brother Jonathan, Very pleasant wast thou to me; Wonderful was thy love to me, Above the love of women!"
10001027,10,1,27,"How have the mighty fallen, Yea, the weapons of war perish!'"
10002001,10,2,1,"And it cometh to pass afterwards, that David asketh at Jehovah, saying, `Do I go up into one of the cities of Judah?' and Jehovah saith unto him, `Go up.' And David saith, `Whither do I go up?' and He saith, `To Hebron.'"
10002002,10,2,2,"And David goeth up thither, and also his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;"
10002003,10,2,3,and his men who `are' with him hath David brought up -- a man and his household -- and they dwell in the cities of Hebron.
10002004,10,2,4,"And the men of Judah come, and anoint there David for king over the house of Judah; and they declare to David, saying, `The men of Jabesh-Gilead `are' they who buried Saul.'"
10002005,10,2,5,"And David sendeth messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and saith unto them, `Blessed `are' ye of Jehovah, in that ye have done this kindness with your lord, with Saul, that ye bury him."
10002006,10,2,6,"`And, now, Jehovah doth with you kindness and truth, and also, I do with you this good because ye have done this thing;"
10002007,10,2,7,"and now, are your hands strong, and be ye for sons of valour, for your lord Saul. `is' dead, and also -- me have the house of Judah anointed for king over them.'"
10002008,10,2,8,"And Abner, son of Ner, head of the host which Saul hath, hath taken Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, and causeth him to pass over to Mahanaim,"
10002009,10,2,9,"and causeth him to reign over Gilead, and over the Ashurite, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over Israel -- all of it."
10002010,10,2,10,"A son of forty years, `is' Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, in his reigning over Israel, and two years he hath reigned, only the house of Judah have been after David."
10002011,10,2,11,"And the number of the days that David hath been king in Hebron, over the house of Judah, is seven years and six months."
10002012,10,2,12,"And Abner son of Ner goeth out, and servants of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10002013,10,2,13,"And Joab son of Zeruiah, and servants of David, have gone out, and they meet by the pool of Gibeon together, and sit down, these by the pool on this `side', and these by the pool on that."
10002014,10,2,14,"And Abner saith unto Joab, `Let the youths rise, I pray thee, and they play before us;' and Joab saith, `Let them rise.'"
10002015,10,2,15,"And they rise and pass over, in number twelve of Benjamin, even of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
10002016,10,2,16,"And they lay hold, each on the head of his companion, and his sword `is' in the side of his companion, and they fall together, and `one' calleth that place Helkath-Hazzurim, which `is' in Gibeon,"
10002017,10,2,17,"and the battle is very hard on that day, and Abner is smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10002018,10,2,18,"And there are there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel, and Asahel `is' light on his feet, as one of the roes which `are' in the field,"
10002019,10,2,19,"And Asahel pursueth after Abner, and hath not turned aside to go to the right or to the left, from after Abner."
10002020,10,2,20,"And Abner looketh behind him, and saith, `Art thou he -- Asahel?' and he saith, `I `am'.'"
10002021,10,2,21,"And Abner saith to him, `Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and seize for thee one of the youths, and take to thee his armour;' and Asahel hath not been willing to turn aside from after him."
10002022,10,2,22,"And Abner addeth again, saying unto Asahel, `Turn thee aside from after me, why do I smite thee to the earth? and how do I lift up my face unto Joab thy brother?'"
10002023,10,2,23,"And he refuseth to turn aside, and Abner smiteth him with the hinder part of the spear unto the fifth `rib', and the spear cometh out from behind him, and he falleth there, and dieth under it; and it cometh to pass, every one who hath come unto the place where Asahel hath fallen and dieth -- they stand still."
10002024,10,2,24,"And Joab and Abishai pursue after Abner, and the sun hath gone in, and they have come in unto the height of Ammah, which `is' on the front of Giah, the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
10002025,10,2,25,"And the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together after Abner, and become one troop, and stand on the top of a certain height,"
10002026,10,2,26,"and Abner calleth unto Joab, and saith, `For ever doth the sword consume? hast thou not known that it is bitterness in the latter end? and till when dost thou not say to the people to turn back from after their brethren?'"
10002027,10,2,27,"And Joab saith, `God liveth! for unless thou hadst spoken, surely then from the morning had the people gone up each from after his brother.'"
10002028,10,2,28,"And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and all the people stand still, and pursue no more after Israel, nor have they added any more to fight."
10002029,10,2,29,"And Abner and his men have gone through the plain all that night, and pass over the Jordan, and go on `through' all Bithron, and come in to Mahanaim."
10002030,10,2,30,"And Joab hath turned back from after Abner, and gathereth all the people, and there are lacking of the servants of David nineteen men, and Asahel;"
10002031,10,2,31,"and the servants of David have smitten of Benjamin, even among the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men -- they died."
10002032,10,2,32,"And they lift up Asahel, and bury him in the burying-place of his father, which `is' in Beth-Lehem, and they go all the night -- Joab and his men -- and it is light to them in Hebron."
10003001,10,3,1,"And the war is long between the house of Saul and the house of David, and David is going on and `is' strong, and the house of Saul are going on and `are' weak."
10003002,10,3,2,"And there are born to David sons in Hebron, and his first-born is Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,"
10003003,10,3,3,"and his second `is' Chileab, of Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite, and the third `is' Absalom son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur,"
10003004,10,3,4,"and the fourth `is' Adonijah son of Haggith, and the fifth `is' Shephatiah son of Abital,"
10003005,10,3,5,"and the sixth `is' Ithream, of Eglah wife of David; these have been born to David in Hebron."
10003006,10,3,6,"And it cometh to pass, in the war being between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner hath been strengthening himself in the house of Saul,"
10003007,10,3,7,"and Saul hath a concubine, and her name `is' Rizpah daughter of Aiah, and `Ish-Bosheth' saith unto Abner, `Wherefore hast thou gone in unto the concubine of my father?'"
10003008,10,3,8,"And it is displeasing to Abner exceedingly, because of the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he saith, `The head of a dog `am' I -- that in reference to Judah to-day I do kindness with the house of Saul thy father, unto his brethren, and unto his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David -- that thou chargest against me iniquity concerning the woman to-day?"
10003009,10,3,9,"thus doth God to Abner, and thus He doth add to him, surely as Jehovah hath sworn to David -- surely so I do to him:"
10003010,10,3,10,"to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over Judah, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba.'"
10003011,10,3,11,"And he is not able any more to turn back Abner a word, because of his fearing him."
10003012,10,3,12,"And Abner sendeth messengers unto David for himself, saying, `Whose `is' the land?' saying, `Make thy covenant with me, and lo, my hand `is' with thee, to bring round unto thee all Israel.'"
10003013,10,3,13,"And he saith, `Good -- I make with thee a covenant; only, one thing I am asking of thee, that is, Thou dost not see my face, except thou dost first bring in Michal, daughter of Saul in thy coming into see my face.'"
10003014,10,3,14,"And David sendeth messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, saying, `Give up my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.'"
10003015,10,3,15,"And Ish-Bosheth sendeth, and taketh her from a man, from Phaltiel son of Laish,"
10003016,10,3,16,"and her husband goeth with her, going on and weeping behind her, unto Bahurim, and Abner saith unto him, `Go, turn back;' and he turneth back."
10003017,10,3,17,"And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel, saying, `Heretofore ye have been seeking David for king over you,"
10003018,10,3,18,"and now, do `it', for Jehovah hath spoken of David saying, By the hand of David my servant -- to save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.'"
10003019,10,3,19,"And Abner speaketh also in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner goeth also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that `is' good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin,"
10003020,10,3,20,"and Abner cometh in unto David, to Hebron, and with him twenty men, and David maketh for Abner, and for the men who `are' with him, a banquet."
10003021,10,3,21,"And Abner saith unto David, `I arise, and go, and gather unto my lord the king the whole of Israel, and they make with thee a covenant, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul desireth;' and David sendeth away Abner, and he goeth in peace."
10003022,10,3,22,"And lo, the servants of David, and Joab, have come from the troop, and much spoil have brought with them, and Abner is not with David in Hebron, for he hath sent him away, and he goeth in peace;"
10003023,10,3,23,"and Joab and all the host that `is' with him have come, and they declare to Joab, saying, `Abner son of Ner hath come unto the king, and he sendeth him away, and he goeth in peace.'"
10003024,10,3,24,"And Joab cometh unto the king, and saith, `What hast thou done? lo, Abner hath come unto thee! why `is' this -- thou hast sent him away, and he is really gone?"
10003025,10,3,25,"Thou hast known Abner son of Ner, that to deceive thee he came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou art doing.'"
10003026,10,3,26,"And Joab goeth out from David, and sendeth messengers after Abner, and they bring him back from the well of Sirah, and David knew not."
10003027,10,3,27,"And Abner turneth back to Hebron, and Joab turneth him aside unto the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smiteth him there in the fifth `rib' -- and he dieth -- for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10003028,10,3,28,"And David heareth afterwards and saith, `Acquitted `am' I, and my kingdom, by Jehovah, unto the age, from the blood of Abner son of Ner;"
10003029,10,3,29,"it doth stay on the head of Joab, and on all the house of his father, and there is not cut off from the house of Joab one having an issue, and leprous, and laying hold on a staff, and falling by a sword, and lacking bread.'"
10003030,10,3,30,"And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he put to death Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in battle."
10003031,10,3,31,"And David saith unto Joab, and unto all the people who `are' with him, `Rend your garments, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner;' and king David is going after the bier."
10003032,10,3,32,"And they bury Abner in Hebron, and the king lifteth up his voice, and weepeth at the grave of Abner, and all the people weep;"
10003033,10,3,33,"and the king lamenteth for Abner, and saith: -- `As the death of a fool doth Abner die?"
10003034,10,3,34,"Thy hands not bound, And thy feet to fetters not brought nigh! As one falling before sons of evil -- Thou hast fallen!' and all the people add to weep over him."
10003035,10,3,35,"And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while yet day, and David sweareth, saying, `Thus doth God to me, and thus He doth add, for -- before the going in of the sun, I taste no bread or any other thing.'"
10003036,10,3,36,"And all the people have discerned `it', and it is good in their eyes, as all that the king hath done is good in the eyes of all the people;"
10003037,10,3,37,"and all the people know, even all Israel, in that day, that it hath not been from the king -- to put to death Abner son of Ner."
10003038,10,3,38,"And the king saith unto his servants, `Do ye not know that a prince and a great one hath fallen this day in Israel?"
10003039,10,3,39,"and I to-day `am' tender, and an anointed king: and these men, sons of Zeruiah, `are' too hard for me; Jehovah doth recompense to the doer of the evil according to his evil.'"
10004001,10,4,1,"And the son of Saul heareth that Abner `is' dead in Hebron, and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled."
10004002,10,4,2,"And two men, heads of troops, have been `to' the son of Saul, the name of the one `is' Baanah, and the name of the second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,"
10004003,10,4,3,"and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there sojourners unto this day."
10004004,10,4,4,"And to Jonathan son of Saul `is' a son -- lame; he was a son of five years at the coming in of the rumour of `the death of' Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him up, and fleeth, and it cometh to pass in her hasting to flee, that he falleth, and becometh lame, and his name `is' Mephibosheth."
10004005,10,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down -- the lying down of noon;"
10004006,10,4,6,"and thither they have come, unto the midst of the house, taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth `rib', and Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;"
10004007,10,4,7,"yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed, in the inner part of his bed-chamber, and they smite him, and put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his head, and go the way of the plain all the night,"
10004008,10,4,8,"and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron, and say unto the king, `Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah doth give to my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his seed.'"
10004009,10,4,9,"And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and saith to them, `Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
10004010,10,4,10,"when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him `for' the tidings."
10004011,10,4,11,"Also -- when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'"
10004012,10,4,12,"And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang `them' over the pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken, and bury `it' in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron."
10005001,10,5,1,"And all the tribes of Israel come unto David, to Hebron, and speak, saying, `Lo, we `are' thy bone and thy flesh;"
10005002,10,5,2,"also heretofore, in Saul's being king over us, thou hast been he who is bringing out and bringing in Israel, and Jehovah saith to thee, Thou dost feed My people Israel, and thou art for leader over Israel.'"
10005003,10,5,3,"And all the elders of Israel come unto the king, to Hebron, and king David maketh with them a covenant in Hebron before Jehovah, and they anoint David for king over Israel."
10005004,10,5,4,A son of thirty years `is' David in his being king; forty years he hath reigned;
10005005,10,5,5,"in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years, over all Israel and Judah."
10005006,10,5,6,"And the king goeth, and his men, to Jerusalem, unto the Jebusite, the inhabitant of the land, and they speak to David, saying, `Thou dost not come in hither, except thou turn aside the blind and the lame;' saying, `David doth not come in hither.'"
10005007,10,5,7,"And David captureth the fortress of Zion, it `is' the city of David."
10005008,10,5,8,"And David saith on that day, `Any one smiting the Jebusite, (let him go up by the watercourse), and the lame and the blind -- the hated of David's soul,' -- because the blind and lame say, `He doth not come into the house.'"
10005009,10,5,9,"And David dwelleth in the fortress, and calleth it -- City of David, and David buildeth round about, from Millo and inward,"
10005010,10,5,10,"and David goeth, going on and becoming great, and Jehovah, God of Hosts, `is' with him."
10005011,10,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sendeth messengers unto David, and cedar-trees, and artificers of wood, and artificers of stone, for walls, and they build a house for David,"
10005012,10,5,12,"and David knoweth that Jehovah hath established him for king over Israel, and that He hath lifted up his kingdom, because of His people Israel."
10005013,10,5,13,"And David taketh again concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after his coming from Hebron, and there are born again to David sons and daughters."
10005014,10,5,14,"And these `are' the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
10005015,10,5,15,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10005016,10,5,16,"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet."
10005017,10,5,17,"And the Philistines hear that they have anointed David for king over Israel, and all the Philistines come up to seek David, and David heareth, and goeth down unto the fortress,"
10005018,10,5,18,"and the Philistines have come, and are spread out in the valley of Rephaim."
10005019,10,5,19,"And David asketh of Jehovah, saying, `Do I go up unto the Philistines? dost Thou give them into my hand?' And Jehovah saith unto David, `Go up, for I certainly give the Philistines into thy hand.'"
10005020,10,5,20,"And David cometh in to Baal-Perazim, and David smiteth them there, and saith, `Jehovah hath broken forth `on' mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters;' therefore he hath called the name of that place Baal-Perazim."
10005021,10,5,21,"And they forsake there their idols, and David and his men lift them up."
10005022,10,5,22,"And the Philistines add again to come up, and are spread out in the valley of Rephaim,"
10005023,10,5,23,"and David asketh of Jehovah, and He saith, `Thou dost not go up, turn round unto their rear, and thou hast come to them over-against the mulberries,"
10005024,10,5,24,"and it cometh to pass, in thy hearing the sound of a stepping in the tops of the mulberries, then thou dost move sharply, for then hath Jehovah gone out before thee to smite in the camp of the Philistines.'"
10005025,10,5,25,"And David doth so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smiteth the Philistines from Geba unto thy coming to Gazer."
10006001,10,6,1,"And David gathered again every chosen one in Israel, thirty thousand,"
10006002,10,6,2,"and David riseth and goeth, and all the people who `are' with him, from Baale-Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God, whose name hath been called -- the name of Jehovah of Hosts, inhabiting the cherubs -- upon it."
10006003,10,6,3,"And they cause the ark of God to ride on a new cart, and lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which `is' in the height, and Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab are leading the new cart;"
10006004,10,6,4,"and they lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which `is' in the height, with the ark of God, and Ahio is going before the ark,"
10006005,10,6,5,"and David and all the house of Israel are playing before Jehovah, with all kinds of `instruments' of fir-wood, even with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cornets, and with cymbals."
10006006,10,6,6,"And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah putteth forth `his hand' unto the ark of God, and layeth hold on it, for they released the oxen;"
10006007,10,6,7,"and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Uzzah, and God smiteth him there for the error, and he dieth there by the ark of God."
10006008,10,6,8,"And it is displeasing to David, because that Jehovah hath broken forth a breach upon Uzzah, and `one' calleth that place Perez-Uzzah, unto this day;"
10006009,10,6,9,"and David feareth Jehovah on that day, and saith, `How doth the ark of Jehovah come in unto me?'"
10006010,10,6,10,"And David hath not been willing to turn aside unto himself the ark of Jehovah, to the city of David, and David turneth it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite,"
10006011,10,6,11,"and the ark of Jehovah doth inhabit the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months, and Jehovah blesseth Obed-Edom and all his house."
10006012,10,6,12,"And it is declared to king David, saying, `Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he hath, because of the ark of God;' and David goeth and bringeth up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with joy."
10006013,10,6,13,"And it cometh to pass, when those bearing the ark of Jehovah have stepped six steps, that he sacrificeth an ox and a fatling."
10006014,10,6,14,"And David is dancing with all strength before Jehovah, and David is girded with a linen ephod,"
10006015,10,6,15,"and David and all the house of Israel are bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the voice of a trumpet,"
10006016,10,6,16,"and it hath come to pass, the ark of Jehovah hath come in to the city of David, and Michal daughter of Saul, hath looked through the window, and seeth king David moving and dancing before Jehovah, and despiseth him in her heart."
10006017,10,6,17,"And they bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it up in its place, in the midst of the tent which David hath spread out for it, and David causeth to ascend burnt-offerings before Jehovah, and peace-offerings."
10006018,10,6,18,"And David finisheth from causing to ascend the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts,"
10006019,10,6,19,"and he apportioneth to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man even unto woman, to each, one cake of bread, and one eshpar, and one ashisha, and all the people go, each to his house."
10006020,10,6,20,"And David turneth back to bless his house, and Michal daughter of Saul goeth out to meet David, and saith, `How honourable to-day was the king of Israel, who was uncovered to-day before the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain ones is openly uncovered!'"
10006021,10,6,21,"And David saith unto Michal, `-- Before Jehovah, who fixed on me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Jehovah, and over Israel, -- yea, I played before Jehovah;"
10006022,10,6,22,"and I have been more vile than this, and have been low in mine eyes, and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of, with them I am honoured.'"
10006023,10,6,23,"As to Michal daughter of Saul, she had no child till the day of her death."
10007001,10,7,1,"And it cometh to pass, when the king sat in his house, and Jehovah hath given rest to him round about, from all his enemies,"
10007002,10,7,2,"that the king saith unto Nathan the prophet, `See, I pray thee, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God is dwelling in the midst of the curtain.'"
10007003,10,7,3,"And Nathan saith unto the king, `All that `is' in thine heart -- go, do, for Jehovah `is' with thee.'"
10007004,10,7,4,"And it cometh to pass in that night, that the word of Jehovah is unto Nathan, saying,"
10007005,10,7,5,"`Go, and thou hast said unto My servant, unto David, Thus said Jehovah, Dost thou build for Me a house for My dwelling in?"
10007006,10,7,6,"for I have not dwelt in a house even from the day of My bringing up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even unto this day, and am walking up and down in a tent and in a tabernacle."
10007007,10,7,7,"During all `the time' that I have walked up and down among all the sons of Israel, a word have I spoken with one of the tribes of Israel which I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, `Why have ye not built to Me a house of cedars?"
10007008,10,7,8,"and now, thus dost thou say to My servant, to David: `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from the comely place, from after the flock, to be leader over My people, over Israel;"
10007009,10,7,9,"and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and I cut off all thine enemies from thy presence, and have made for thee a great name, as the name of the great ones who `are' in the earth,"
10007010,10,7,10,"and I have appointed a place for My people, for Israel, and have planted it, and it hath tabernacled in its place, and it is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness do not add to afflict it any more, as in the beginning,"
10007011,10,7,11,"even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I have given rest to thee from all thine enemies, and Jehovah hath declared to thee that Jehovah doth make for thee a house."
10007012,10,7,12,"`When thy days are full, and thou hast lain with thy fathers, then I have raised up thy seed after thee which goeth out from thy bowels, and have established his kingdom;"
10007013,10,7,13,"He doth build a house for My Name, and I have established the throne of his kingdom unto the age."
10007014,10,7,14,"I am to him for a father, and he is to Me for a son; whom in his dealings perversely I have even reproved with a rod of men, and with strokes of the sons of Adam,"
10007015,10,7,15,"and My kindness doth not turn aside from him, as I turned it aside from Saul, whom I turned aside from before thee,"
10007016,10,7,16,"and stedfast `is' thy house and thy kingdom unto the age before thee, thy throne is established unto the age.'"
10007017,10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan unto David."
10007018,10,7,18,"And king David cometh in and sitteth before Jehovah, and saith, `Who `am' I, Lord Jehovah? and what my house, that Thou hast brought me hitherto?"
10007019,10,7,19,"And yet this `is' little in Thine eyes, Lord Jehovah, and Thou dost speak also concerning the house of Thy servant afar off; and this `is' the law of the Man, Lord Jehovah."
10007020,10,7,20,"And what doth David add more to speak unto Thee? and Thou, Thou hast known Thy servant, Lord Jehovah."
10007021,10,7,21,"Because of Thy word, and according to Thy heart, Thou hast done all this greatness, to cause Thy servant to know `it'."
10007022,10,7,22,"Therefore Thou hast been great, Jehovah God, for there is none like Thee, and there is no God save Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
10007023,10,7,23,"`And who `is' as Thy people, as Israel -- one nation in the earth, whom God hath gone to redeem to Him for a people, and to make for Him a name -- and to do for you the greatness -- even fearful things for Thy land, at the presence of Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed to Thee out of Egypt -- `among the' nations and their gods?"
10007024,10,7,24,"Yea, Thou dost establish to Thee Thy people Israel, to Thee for a people unto the age, and Thou, Jehovah, hast been to them for God."
10007025,10,7,25,"`And now, Jehovah God, the word which Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, establish unto the age, and do as Thou hast spoken;"
10007026,10,7,26,"And Thy Name is great unto the age, saying, Jehovah of Hosts `is' God over Israel, and the house of Thy servant David is established before Thee,"
10007027,10,7,27,"For Thou, Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Thou hast uncovered the ear of Thy servant, saying, A house I build for thee, therefore hath Thy servant found his heart to pray unto Thee this prayer;"
10007028,10,7,28,"And now, Lord Jehovah, Thou `art' God Himself, and Thy words are truth, and Thou speakest unto Thy servant this goodness,"
10007029,10,7,29,"And now, begin and bless the house of Thy servant, to be unto the age before Thee, for Thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken, and by Thy blessing is the house of Thy servant blessed -- to the age.'"
10008001,10,8,1,"And it cometh to pass afterwards that David smiteth the Philistines, and humbleth them, and David taketh the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines."
10008002,10,8,2,"And he smiteth Moab, and measureth them with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth, and he measureth two lines to put to death, and the fulness of the line to keep alive, and the Moabites are to David for servants, bearers of a present."
10008003,10,8,3,"And David smiteth Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, in his going to bring back his power by the River `Euphrates;'"
10008004,10,8,4,"and David captureth from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyeth utterly the whole of the charioteers, only he leaveth of them a hundred charioteers."
10008005,10,8,5,"And Aram of Damascus cometh to give help to Hadadezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth of Aram twenty and two thousand men;"
10008006,10,8,6,"and David putteth garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram is to David for a servant, bearing a present; and Jehovah saveth David whithersoever he hath gone;"
10008007,10,8,7,"and David taketh the shields of gold which were on the servants of Hadadezer, and bringeth them to Jerusalem;"
10008008,10,8,8,"and from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, hath king David taken very much brass."
10008009,10,8,9,"And Toi king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten all the force of Hadadezer,"
10008010,10,8,10,"and Toi sendeth Joram his son unto king David to ask of him of welfare, and to bless him, (because that he hath fought against Hadadezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars `with' Toi had Hadadezer been), and in his hand have been vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass,"
10008011,10,8,11,"also them did king David sanctify to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold which he sanctified of all the nations which he subdued:"
10008012,10,8,12,"of Aram, and of Moab, and of the Bene-Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah."
10008013,10,8,13,And David maketh a name in his turning back from his smiting Aram in the valley of Salt -- eighteen thousand;
10008014,10,8,14,"and he putteth in Edom garrisons -- in all Edom he hath put garrisons, and all Edom are servants to David; and Jehovah saveth David whithersoever he hath gone."
10008015,10,8,15,"And David reigneth over all Israel, and David is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,"
10008016,10,8,16,"and Joab son of Zeruiah `is' over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud `is' remembrancer,"
10008017,10,8,17,"and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar, `are' priests, and Seraiah `is' scribe,"
10008018,10,8,18,"and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is over' both the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the sons of David have been ministers."
10009001,10,9,1,"And David saith, `Is there yet any left to the house of Saul, and I do with him kindness because of Jonathan?'"
10009002,10,9,2,"And the house of Saul hath a servant, and his name `is' Ziba, and they call for him unto David; and the king saith unto him, `Art thou Ziba?' and he saith, `Thy servant.'"
10009003,10,9,3,"And the king saith, `Is there not yet a man to the house of Saul, and I do with him the kindness of God?' And Ziba saith unto the king, `Jonathan hath yet a son -- lame.'"
10009004,10,9,4,"And the king saith to him, `Where `is' he?' and Ziba saith unto the king, `Lo, he `is' in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-Debar.'"
10009005,10,9,5,"And king David sendeth, and taketh him out of the house of Machir son of Ammiel, of Lo-Debar,"
10009006,10,9,6,"and Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul, cometh unto David, and falleth on his face, and doth obeisance, and David saith, `Mephibosheth;' and he saith, `Lo, thy servant.'"
10009007,10,9,7,"And David saith to him, `Be not afraid; for I certainly do with thee kindness because of Jonathan thy father, and have given back to thee all the field of Saul thy father, and thou dost eat bread at my table continually.'"
10009008,10,9,8,"And he boweth himself, and saith, `What `is' thy servant, that thou hast turned unto the dead dog -- such as I?'"
10009009,10,9,9,"And the king calleth unto Ziba servant of Saul, and saith unto him, `All that was to Saul and to all his house, I have given to the son of thy lord,"
10009010,10,9,10,"and thou hast served for him the land, thou and thy sons, and thy servants, and hast brought in, and there hath been to the son of thy lord bread, and he hath eaten it; and Mephibosheth son of thy lord doth eat continually bread at my table;' and Ziba hath fifteen sons and twenty servants."
10009011,10,9,11,"And Ziba saith unto the king, `According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so doth thy servant;' as to Mephibosheth, `he is eating at my table (`saith the king') as one of the sons of the king.'"
10009012,10,9,12,"And Mephibosheth hath a young son, and his name `is' Micha, and every one dwelling in the house of Ziba `are' servants to Mephibosheth."
10009013,10,9,13,"And Mephibosheth is dwelling in Jerusalem, for at the table of the king he is eating continually, and he `is' lame of his two feet."
10010001,10,10,1,"And it cometh to pass afterwards, that the king of the Bene-Ammon dieth, and Hanun his son reigneth in his stead,"
10010002,10,10,2,"and David saith, `I do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash, as his father did with me kindness;' and David sendeth to comfort him by the hand of his servants concerning his father, and the servants of David come in to the land of the Bene-Ammon."
10010003,10,10,3,"And the heads of the Bene-Ammon say unto Hanun their lord, `Is David honouring thy father in thine eyes because he hath sent to thee comforters? for to search the city, and to spy it, and to overthrow it, hath not David sent his servants unto thee?'"
10010004,10,10,4,"And Hanun taketh the servants of David, and shaveth off the half of their beard, and cutteth off their long robes in the midst -- unto their buttocks, and sendeth them away;"
10010005,10,10,5,"and they declare `it' to David, and he sendeth to meet them, for the men have been greatly ashamed, and the king saith, `Abide in Jericho till your beard doth spring up -- then ye have returned.'"
10010006,10,10,6,"And the Bene-Ammon see that they have been abhorred by David, and the Bene-Ammon send and hire Aram of Beth-Rehob, and Aram of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah `with' a thousand men, and Ish-Tob `with' twelve thousand men;"
10010007,10,10,7,"and David heareth, and sendeth Joab, and all the host -- the mighty men."
10010008,10,10,8,"And the Bene-Ammon come out, and set battle in array, at the opening of the gate, and Aram of Zoba, and Rehob, and Ish-Tob, and Maacah, `are' by themselves in the field;"
10010009,10,10,9,"and Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto him before and behind, and he chooseth of all the chosen in Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,"
10010010,10,10,10,"and the rest of the people he hath given into the hand of Abishai his brother, and setteth in array to meet the Bene-Ammon."
10010011,10,10,11,"And he saith, `If Aram be stronger than I, then thou hast been to me for salvation, and if the Bene-Ammon be stronger than thou, then I have come to give salvation to thee;"
10010012,10,10,12,"be strong and strengthen thyself for our people, and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah doth that which is good in His eyes.'"
10010013,10,10,13,"And Joab draweth nigh, and the people who `are' with him, to battle against Aram, and they flee from his presence;"
10010014,10,10,14,"and the Bene-Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled, and they flee from the presence of Abishai, and go in to the city; and Joab turneth back from the Bene-Ammon, and cometh in to Jerusalem."
10010015,10,10,15,"And Aram seeth that it is smitten before Israel, and they are gathered together;"
10010016,10,10,16,"and Hadadezer sendeth, and bringeth out Aram which `is' beyond the River, and they come in to Helam, and Shobach head of the host of Hadadezer `is' before them."
10010017,10,10,17,"And it is declared to David, and he gathereth all Israel, and passeth over the Jordan, and cometh in to Helam, and Aram setteth itself in array to meet David, and they fight with him;"
10010018,10,10,18,"and Aram fleeth from the presence of Israel, and David slayeth of Aram seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and Shobach head of its host he hath smitten, and he dieth there."
10010019,10,10,19,"And all the kings -- servants of Hadadezer -- see that they have been smitten before Israel, and make peace with Israel, and serve them; and Aram is afraid to help any more the Bene-Ammon."
10011001,10,11,1,"And it cometh to pass, at the revolution of the year -- at the time of the going out of the messengers -- that David sendeth Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they destroy the Bene-Ammon, and lay siege against Rabbah. And David is dwelling in Jerusalem,"
10011002,10,11,2,"and it cometh to pass, at evening-time, that David riseth from off his couch, and walketh up and down on the roof of the king's house, and seeth from the roof a woman bathing, and the woman `is' of very good appearance,"
10011003,10,11,3,"and David sendeth and inquireth about the woman, and saith, `Is not this Bath-Sheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?'"
10011004,10,11,4,"And David sendeth messengers, and taketh her, and she cometh unto him, and he lieth with her -- and she is purifying herself from her uncleanness -- and she turneth back unto her house;"
10011005,10,11,5,"and the woman conceiveth, and sendeth, and declareth to David, and saith, `I `am' conceiving.'"
10011006,10,11,6,"And David sendeth unto Joab, `Send unto me Uriah the Hittite,' and Joab sendeth Uriah unto David;"
10011007,10,11,7,"and Uriah cometh unto him, and David asketh of the prosperity of Joab, and of the prosperity of the people, and of the prosperity of the war."
10011008,10,11,8,"And David saith to Uriah, `Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet;' and Uriah goeth out of the king's house, and there goeth out after him a gift from the king,"
10011009,10,11,9,"and Uriah lieth down at the opening of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and hath not gone down unto his house."
10011010,10,11,10,"And they declare to David, saying, `Uriah hath not gone down unto his house;' and David saith unto Uriah, `Hast thou not come from a journey? wherefore hast thou not gone down unto thy house?'"
10011011,10,11,11,"And Uriah saith unto David, `The ark, and Israel, and Judah, are abiding in booths, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, on the face of the field are encamping; and I -- I go in unto my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife! -- thy life, and the life of thy soul -- if I do this thing.'"
10011012,10,11,12,"And David saith unto Uriah, `Abide in this `place' also to-day, and to-morrow I send thee away;' and Uriah abideth in Jerusalem, on that day, and on the morrow,"
10011013,10,11,13,"and David calleth for him, and he eateth before him, and drinketh, and he causeth him to drink, and he goeth out in the evening to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, and unto his house he hath not gone down."
10011014,10,11,14,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, that David writeth a letter unto Joab, and sendeth by the hand of Uriah;"
10011015,10,11,15,"and he writeth in the letter, saying, `Place ye Uriah over-against the front of the severest battle, and ye have turned back from after him, and he hath been smitten, and hath died.'"
10011016,10,11,16,"And it cometh to pass in Joab's watching of the city, that he appointeth Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men `are';"
10011017,10,11,17,"and the men of the city go out and fight with Joab, and there fall `some' of the people, of the servants of David; and there dieth also Uriah the Hittite."
10011018,10,11,18,"And Joab sendeth and declareth to David all the matters of the war,"
10011019,10,11,19,"and commandeth the messenger, saying, `At thy finishing all the matters of the war to speak unto the king,"
10011020,10,11,20,"then, it hath been, if the king's fury ascend, and he hath said to thee, Wherefore did ye draw nigh unto the city to fight? did ye not know that they shoot from off the wall?"
10011021,10,11,21,"Who smote Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast on him a piece of a rider from the wall, and he dieth in Thebez? why drew ye nigh unto the wall? that thou hast said, Also thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'"
10011022,10,11,22,"And the messenger goeth, and cometh in, and declareth to David all that with which Joab sent him,"
10011023,10,11,23,"and the messenger saith unto David, `Surely the men have been mighty against us, and come out unto us into the field, and we are upon them unto the opening of the gate,"
10011024,10,11,24,"and those shooting shoot at thy servants from off the wall, and `some' of the servants of the king are dead, and also, thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead."
10011025,10,11,25,"And David saith unto the messenger, `Thus dost thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing be evil in thine eyes; for thus and thus doth the sword devour; strengthen thy warfare against the city, and throw it down -- and strengthen thou him.'"
10011026,10,11,26,"And the wife of Uriah heareth that Uriah her husband `is' dead, and lamenteth for her lord;"
10011027,10,11,27,"and the mourning passeth by, and David sendeth and gathereth her unto his house, and she is to him for a wife, and beareth to him a son; and the thing which David hath done is evil in the eyes of Jehovah."
10012001,10,12,1,"And Jehovah sendeth Nathan unto David, and he cometh unto him, and saith to him: `Two men have been in one city; One rich and one poor;"
10012002,10,12,2,The rich hath flocks and herds very many;
10012003,10,12,3,"And the poor one hath nothing, Except one little ewe-lamb, Which he hath bought, and keepeth alive, And it groweth up with him, And with his sons together; Of his morsel it eateth, And from his cup it drinketh, And in his bosom it lieth, And it is to him as a daughter;"
10012004,10,12,4,"And there cometh a traveller to the rich man, And he spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To prepare for the traveller Who hath come to him, And he taketh the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepareth it for the man Who hath come unto him.'"
10012005,10,12,5,"And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly, and he saith unto Nathan, `Jehovah liveth, surely a son of death `is' the man who is doing this,"
10012006,10,12,6,"and the ewe-lamb he doth repay fourfold, because that he hath done this thing, and because that he had no pity.'"
10012007,10,12,7,"And Nathan saith unto David, `Thou `art' the man! Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;"
10012008,10,12,8,"and I give to thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of thy lord, into thy bosom, and I give to thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if little, then I add to thee such and such `things'."
10012009,10,12,9,"`Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do the evil thing in His eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten by the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to thee for a wife, and him thou hast slain by the sword of the Bene-Ammon."
10012010,10,12,10,"`And now, the sword doth not turn aside from thy house unto the age, because thou hast despised Me, and dost take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for a wife;"
10012011,10,12,11,"thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am raising up against thee evil, out of thy house, and have taken thy wives before thine eyes, and given to thy neighbour, and he hath lain with thy wives before the eyes of this sun;"
10012012,10,12,12,"for thou hast done `it' in secret, and I do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'"
10012013,10,12,13,"And David saith unto Nathan, `I have sinned against Jehovah.' And Nathan saith unto David, `Also -- Jehovah hath caused thy sin to pass away; thou dost not die;"
10012014,10,12,14,"only, because thou hast caused the enemies of Jehovah greatly to despise by this thing, also the son who is born to thee doth surely die.'"
10012015,10,12,15,"And Nathan goeth unto his house, and Jehovah smiteth the lad, whom the wife of Uriah hath born to David, and it is incurable;"
10012016,10,12,16,"and David seeketh God for the youth, and David keepeth a fast, and hath gone in and lodged, and lain on the earth."
10012017,10,12,17,"And the elders of his house rise against him, to raise him up from the earth, and he hath not been willing, nor hath he eaten with them bread;"
10012018,10,12,18,"and it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the lad dieth, and the servants of David fear to declare to him that the lad is dead, for they said, `Lo, in the lad being alive we spake unto him, and he did not hearken to our voice; and how do we say unto him, The lad is dead? -- then he hath done evil.'"
10012019,10,12,19,"And David seeth that his servants are whispering, and David understandeth that the lad is dead, and David saith unto his servants, `Is the lad dead?' and they say, `Dead.'"
10012020,10,12,20,"And David riseth from the earth, and doth bathe and anoint `himself', and changeth his raiment, and cometh in to the house of Jehovah, and boweth himself, and cometh unto his house, and asketh and they place for him bread, and he eateth."
10012021,10,12,21,"And his servants say unto him, `What `is' this thing thou hast done? because of the living lad thou hast fasted and dost weep, and when the lad is dead thou hast risen and dost eat bread.'"
10012022,10,12,22,"And he saith, `While the lad is alive I have fasted, and weep, for I said, Who knoweth? -- Jehovah doth pity me, and the lad hath lived;"
10012023,10,12,23,"and now, he hath died, why `is' this -- I fast? am I able to bring him back again? I am going unto him, and he doth not turn back unto me.'"
10012024,10,12,24,"And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and goeth in unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he calleth his name Solomon; and Jehovah hath loved him,"
10012025,10,12,25,"and sendeth by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and calleth his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah."
10012026,10,12,26,"And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and captureth the royal city,"
10012027,10,12,27,"and Joab sendeth messengers unto David, and saith, `I have fought against Rabbah -- also I have captured the city of waters;"
10012028,10,12,28,"and now, gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city, and my name hath been called upon it.'"
10012029,10,12,29,"And David gathereth all the people, and goeth to Rabbah, and fighteth against it, and captureth it;"
10012030,10,12,30,"and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head, and its weight `is' a talent of gold, and precious stones, and it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he hath brought out, very much;"
10012031,10,12,31,"and the people who `are' in it he hath brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes of iron, and hath caused them to pass over into the brick-kiln; and so he doth to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon; and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem."
10013001,10,13,1,"And it cometh to pass afterwards that Absalom son of David hath a fair sister, and her name `is' Tamar, and Amnon son of David loveth her."
10013002,10,13,2,"And Amnon hath distress -- even to become sick, because of Tamar his sister, for she `is' a virgin, and it is hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her."
10013003,10,13,3,"And Amnon hath a friend, and his name `is' Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother, and Jonadab `is' a very wise man,"
10013004,10,13,4,"and saith to him, `Wherefore `art' thou thus lean, O king's son, morning by morning? dost thou not declare to me?' And Amnon saith to him, `Tamar -- sister of Absalom my brother -- I am loving.'"
10013005,10,13,5,"And Jonadab saith to him, `Lie down on thy couch, and feign thyself sick, and thy father hath come in to see thee, and thou hast said unto him, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come in and give me bread to eat; and she hath made the food before mine eyes so that I see `it', and have eaten from her hand.'"
10013006,10,13,6,"And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the king cometh in to see him, and Amnon saith unto the king, `Let, I pray thee, Tamar my sister come, and she maketh before mine eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.'"
10013007,10,13,7,"And David sendeth unto Tamar, to the house, saying, `Go, I pray thee, to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make for him food.'"
10013008,10,13,8,"And Tamar goeth to the house of Amnon her brother, and he is lying down, and she taketh the dough, and kneadeth, and maketh cakes before his eyes, and cooketh the cakes,"
10013009,10,13,9,"and taketh the frying-pan, and poureth out before him, and he refuseth to eat, and Amnon saith, `Take ye out every one from me;' and they go out every one from him."
10013010,10,13,10,"And Amnon saith unto Tamar, `Bring the food into the inner chamber, and I eat from thy hand;' and Tamar taketh the cakes that she hath made, and bringeth in to Amnon her brother, into the inner chamber,"
10013011,10,13,11,"and she bringeth nigh unto him to eat, and he layeth hold on her, and saith to her, `Come, lie with me, my sister.'"
10013012,10,13,12,"And she saith to him, `Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it is not done so in Israel; do not this folly."
10013013,10,13,13,"And I -- whither do I cause my reproach to go? and thou -- thou art as one of the fools in Israel; and now, speak, I pray thee, unto the king; for he doth not withhold me from thee.'"
10013014,10,13,14,"And he hath not been willing to hearken to her voice, and is stronger than she, and humbleth her, and lieth with her."
10013015,10,13,15,"And Amnon hateth her -- a very great hatred -- that greater `is' the hatred with which he hath hated her than the love with which he loved her, and Amnon saith to her, `Rise, go.'"
10013016,10,13,16,"And she saith to him, `Because of the circumstances this evil is greater than the other that thou hast done with me -- to send me away;' and he hath not been willing to hearken to her,"
10013017,10,13,17,"and calleth his young man, his servant, and saith, `Send away, I pray thee, this one from me without, and bolt the door after her;'"
10013018,10,13,18,"-- and upon her `is' a long coat, for such upper robes do daughters of the king who `are' virgins put on, -- and his servant taketh her out without, and hath bolted the door after her."
10013019,10,13,19,"And Tamar taketh ashes for her head, and the long coat that `is' on her she hath rent, and putteth her hand on her head, and goeth, going on and crying;"
10013020,10,13,20,"and Absalom her brother saith unto her, `Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? and now, my sister, keep silent, he `is' thy brother; set not thy heart to this thing;' and Tamar dwelleth -- but desolate -- in the house of Absalom her brother."
10013021,10,13,21,"And king David hath heard all these things, and it is very displeasing to him;"
10013022,10,13,22,"and Absalom hath not spoken with Amnon either evil or good, for Absalom is hating Amnon, because that he humbled Tamar his sister."
10013023,10,13,23,"And it cometh to pass, after two years of days, that Absalom hath shearers in Baal-Hazor, which `is' with Ephraim, and Absalom calleth for all the sons of the king."
10013024,10,13,24,"And Absalom cometh unto the king, and saith, `Lo, I pray thee, thy servant hath shearers, let the king go, I pray thee, and his servants, with thy servant.'"
10013025,10,13,25,"And the king saith unto Absalom, `Nay, my son, let us not all go, I pray thee, and we are not too heavy on thee;' and he presseth on him, and he hath not been willing to go, and he blesseth him."
10013026,10,13,26,"And Absalom saith, `If not -- let, I pray thee, Amnon my brother go with us;' and the king saith to him, `Why doth he go with thee?'"
10013027,10,13,27,"and Absalom urgeth on him, and he sendeth with him Amnon, and all the sons of the king."
10013028,10,13,28,"And Absalom commandeth his young men, saying, `See, I pray thee, when the heart of Amnon `is' glad with wine, and I have said unto you, Smite Amnon, that ye have put him to death; fear not; is it not because I have commanded you? be strong, yea, become sons of valour.'"
10013029,10,13,29,"And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom commanded, and rise do all the sons of the king, and they ride, each on his mule, and flee."
10013030,10,13,30,"And it cometh to pass -- they `are' in the way -- and the report hath come unto David, saying, `Absalom hath smitten all the sons of the king, and there is not left of them one;'"
10013031,10,13,31,"and the king riseth, and rendeth his garments, and lieth on the earth, and all his servants are standing by `with' rent garments."
10013032,10,13,32,"And Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answereth and saith, `Let not my lord say, The whole of the young men, the sons of the king, they have put to death; for Amnon alone `is' dead, for by the command of Absalom it hath been appointed from the day of his humbling Tamar his sister;"
10013033,10,13,33,"and now, let not my lord the king lay unto his heart the word, saying, All the sons of the king have died, for Amnon alone `is' dead.'"
10013034,10,13,34,"And Absalom fleeth, and the young man who is watching lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and lo, much people are coming by the way behind him, on the side of the hill."
10013035,10,13,35,"And Jonadab saith unto the king, `Lo, the sons of the king have come; as the word of thy servant, so it hath been.'"
10013036,10,13,36,"And it cometh to pass at his finishing to speak, that lo, the sons of the king have come, and they lift up their voice, and weep, and also the king and all his servants have wept -- a very great weeping."
10013037,10,13,37,"And Absalom hath fled, and goeth unto Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, and `David' mourneth for his son all the days."
10013038,10,13,38,"And Absalom hath fled, and goeth to Geshur, and is there three years;"
10013039,10,13,39,"and `the soul of' king David determineth to go out unto Absalom, for he hath been comforted for Amnon, for `he is' dead."
10014001,10,14,1,"And Joab son of Zeruial knoweth that the heart of the king `is' on Absalom,"
10014002,10,14,2,"and Joab sendeth to Tekoah, and taketh thence a wise woman, and saith unto her, `Feign thyself a mourner, I pray thee, and put on, I pray thee, garments of mourning, and anoint not thyself with oil, and thou hast been as a woman these many days mourning for the dead,"
10014003,10,14,3,"and thou hast gone unto the king, and spoken unto him, according to this word;' and Joab putteth the words into her mouth."
10014004,10,14,4,"And the woman of Tekoah speaketh unto the king, and falleth on her face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and saith, `Save, O king.'"
10014005,10,14,5,"And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee?' and she saith, `Truly a widow woman `am' I, and my husband dieth,"
10014006,10,14,6,"and thy maid-servant hath two sons; and they strive both of them in a field, and there is no deliverer between them, and the one smiteth the other, and putteth him to death;"
10014007,10,14,7,"and lo, the whole family hath risen against thy maid-servant, and say, Give up him who smiteth his brother, and we put him to death for the life of his brother whom he hath slain, and we destroy also the heir; and they have quenched my coal which is left -- so as not to set to my husband a name and remnant on the face of the ground.'"
10014008,10,14,8,"And the king saith unto the woman, `Go to thine house, and I give charge concerning thee.'"
10014009,10,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoah saith unto the king, `On me, my lord, O king, `is' the iniquity, and on the house of my father; and the king and his throne `are' innocent.'"
10014010,10,14,10,"And the king saith, `He who speaketh `aught' unto thee, and thou hast brought him unto me, then he doth not add any more to come against thee.'"
10014011,10,14,11,"And she saith, `Let, I pray thee, the king remember by Jehovah thy God, that the redeemer of blood add not to destroy, and they destroy not my son;' and he saith, `Jehovah liveth; if there doth fall of the hair of thy son to the earth.'"
10014012,10,14,12,"And the woman saith, `Let, I pray thee, thy maid-servant speak unto my lord the king a word;' and he saith, `Speak.'"
10014013,10,14,13,"And the woman saith, `And why hast thou thought thus concerning the people of God? yea, the king is speaking this thing as a guilty one, in that the king hath not brought back his outcast;"
10014014,10,14,14,"for we do surely die, and `are' as water which is running down to the earth, which is not gathered, and God doth not accept a person, and hath devised devices in that the outcast is not outcast by Him."
10014015,10,14,15,"`And now that I have come to speak unto the king my lord this word, `it is' because the people made me afraid, and thy maid-servant saith, Let me speak, I pray thee, unto the king; it may be the king doth do the word of his handmaid,"
10014016,10,14,16,"for the king doth hearken to deliver his handmaid out of the paw of the man `seeking' to destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God,"
10014017,10,14,17,"and thy maid-servant saith, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for ease; for as a messenger of God so `is' my lord the king, to understand the good and the evil; and Jehovah thy God is with thee.'"
10014018,10,14,18,"And the king answereth and saith unto the woman, `Do not, I pray thee, hide from me the thing that I am asking thee;' and the woman saith, `Let, I pray thee, my lord the king speak.'"
10014019,10,14,19,"And the king saith, `Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?' And the woman answereth and saith, `Thy soul liveth, my lord, O king, none `doth turn' to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab he commanded me, and he put in the mouth of thy maid-servant all these words;"
10014020,10,14,20,"in order to bring round the appearance of the thing hath thy servant Joab done this thing, and my lord `is' wise, according to the wisdom of a messenger of God, to know all that `is' in the land.'"
10014021,10,14,21,"And the king saith unto Joab, `Lo, I pray thee, thou hast done this thing; and go, bring back the young man Absalom.'"
10014022,10,14,22,"And Joab falleth on his face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and blesseth the king, and Joab saith, `To-day hath thy servant known that I have found grace in thine eyes, my lord, O king, in that the king hath done the word of his servant.'"
10014023,10,14,23,"And Joab riseth and goeth to Geshur, and bringeth in Absalom to Jerusalem,"
10014024,10,14,24,"and the king saith, `Let him turn round unto his house, and my face he doth not see.' And Absalom turneth round unto his house, and the face of the king he hath not seen."
10014025,10,14,25,"And like Absalom there was no man `so' fair in all Israel, to praise greatly; from the sole of his foot even unto his crown there was no blemish in him;"
10014026,10,14,26,"and in his polling his head -- and it hath been at the end of year by year that he polleth `it', for it `is' heavy on him, and he hath polled it -- he hath even weighed out the hair of his head -- two hundred shekels by the king's weight."
10014027,10,14,27,"And there are born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter, and her name `is' Tamar; she was a woman of a fair appearance."
10014028,10,14,28,"And Absalom dwelleth in Jerusalem two years of days, and the face of the king he hath not seen;"
10014029,10,14,29,"and Absalom sendeth unto Joab, to send him unto the king, and he hath not been willing to come unto him; and he sendeth again a second time, and he hath not been willing to come."
10014030,10,14,30,"And he saith unto his servants, `See, the portion of Joab `is' by the side of mine, and he hath barley there; go, and burn it with fire;' and the servants of Absalom burn the portion with fire."
10014031,10,14,31,"And Joab riseth and cometh unto Absalom in the house, and saith unto him, `Why have thy servants burned the portion that I have with fire?'"
10014032,10,14,32,"And Absalom saith unto Joab, `Lo, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, and I send thee unto the king to say, Why have I come in from Geshur? -- good for me while I `am' there -- and now, let me see the king's face, and if there is in me iniquity then thou hast put me to death.'"
10014033,10,14,33,"And Joab cometh unto the king, and declareth `it' to him, and he calleth unto Absalom, and he cometh unto the king, and boweth himself to him, on his face, to the earth, before the king, and the king giveth a kiss to Absalom."
10015001,10,15,1,"And it cometh to pass afterwards, that Absalom prepareth for himself a chariot, and horses, and fifty men are running before him;"
10015002,10,15,2,"and Absalom hath risen early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate, and it cometh to pass, every man who hath a pleading to come unto the king for judgment, that Absalom calleth unto him, and saith, `Of what city `art' thou?' and he saith, `Of one of the tribes of Israel `is' thy servant.'"
10015003,10,15,3,"And Absalom saith unto him, `See, thy matters `are' good and straightforward -- and there is none hearkening to thee from the king.'"
10015004,10,15,4,"And Absalom saith, `Who doth make me a judge in the land, that unto me doth come every man who hath a plea and judgment? -- then I have declared him righteous.'"
10015005,10,15,5,"And it hath come to pass, in the drawing nearing of any one to bow himself to him, that he hath put forth his hand, and laid hold on him, and given a kiss to him;"
10015006,10,15,6,"and Absalom doth according to this thing to all Israel who come in for judgment unto the king, and Absalom stealeth the heart of the men of Israel."
10015007,10,15,7,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty years, that Absalom saith unto the king, `Let me go, I pray thee, and I complete my vow, that I vowed to Jehovah in Hebron,"
10015008,10,15,8,"for a vow hath thy servant vowed in my dwelling in Geshur, in Aram, saying, If Jehovah doth certainly bring me back to Jerusalem, then I have served Jehovah.'"
10015009,10,15,9,"And the king saith to him, `Go in peace;' and he riseth and goeth to Hebron,"
10015010,10,15,10,"and Absalom sendeth spies through all the tribes of Israel, saying, `At your hearing the voice of the trumpet, then ye have said, Absalom hath reigned in Hebron.'"
10015011,10,15,11,"And with Absalom have gone two hundred men, out of Jerusalem, invited ones, and they are going in their simplicity, and have not known anything;"
10015012,10,15,12,"and Absalom sendeth Ahithophel the Gilonite, a counsellor of David, out of his city, out of Gilo, in his sacrificing sacrifices; and the conspiracy is strong, and the people are going and increasing with Absalom."
10015013,10,15,13,"And he who is declaring tidings cometh in unto David, saying, `The heart of the men of Israel hath been after Absalom.'"
10015014,10,15,14,"And David saith to all his servants who `are' with him in Jerusalem, `Rise, and we flee, for we have no escape from the face of Absalom; haste to go, lest he hasten, and have overtaken us, and forced on us evil, and smitten the city by the mouth of the sword.'"
10015015,10,15,15,"And the servants of the king say unto the king, `According to all that my lord the king chooseth -- lo, thy servants `do'.'"
10015016,10,15,16,"And the king goeth out, and all his household at his feet, and the king leaveth ten women -- concubines -- to keep the house."
10015017,10,15,17,"And the king goeth out, and all the people at his feet, and they stand still at the farthest off house."
10015018,10,15,18,"And all his servants are passing on at his side, and all the Cherethite, and all the Pelethite, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came at his feet from Gath, are passing on at the front of the king."
10015019,10,15,19,"And the king saith unto Ittai the Gittite, `Why dost thou go -- thou also -- with us? turn back -- and abide with the king, for thou `art' a stranger, and also an exile thou -- to thy place."
10015020,10,15,20,"Yesterday `is' thy coming in, and to-day I move thee to go with us, and I am going on that which I am going! -- turn back, and take back thy brethren with thee, -- kindness and truth.'"
10015021,10,15,21,"And Ittai answereth the king and saith, `Jehovah liveth, and my lord the king liveth, surely in the place where my lord the king is -- if for death, if for life, surely there is thy servant.'"
10015022,10,15,22,"And David saith unto Ittai, `Go and pass over;' and Ittai the Gittite passeth over, and all his men, and all the infants who `are' with him."
10015023,10,15,23,"And all the land are weeping -- a great voice, and all the people are passing over; and the king is passing over through the brook Kidron, and all the people are passing over on the front of the way of the wilderness;"
10015024,10,15,24,"and lo, also Zadok, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God, and they make the ark of God firm, and Abiathar goeth up, till the completion of all the people to pass over out of the city."
10015025,10,15,25,"And the king saith to Zadok, `Take back the ark of God to the city; if I find grace in the eyes of Jehovah, then He hath brought me back, and shewn me it and His habitation;"
10015026,10,15,26,"and if thus He say, I have not delighted in thee; here `am' I, He doth to me as `is' good in His eyes.'"
10015027,10,15,27,"And the king saith unto Zadok the priest, `Art thou a seer? turn back to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar, your two sons with you;"
10015028,10,15,28,"see ye, I am tarrying in the plains of the wilderness till the coming in of a word from you to declare to me.'"
10015029,10,15,29,"And Zadok taketh back -- and Abiathar -- the ark of God to Jerusalem, and they abide there."
10015030,10,15,30,"And David is going up in the ascent of the olives, going up and weeping, and he hath the head covered, and he is going barefooted, and all the people who `are' with him have covered each his head, and have gone up, going up and weeping;"
10015031,10,15,31,"and David declared, saying, `Ahithophel `is' among the conspirators with Absalom;' and David saith, `Make foolish, I pray Thee, the counsel of Ahithophel, O Jehovah.'"
10015032,10,15,32,"And it cometh to pass, David hath come unto the top, where he boweth himself to God, and lo, to meet him `is' Hushai the Archite, his coat rent, and earth on his head;"
10015033,10,15,33,"and David saith to him, `If thou hast passed on with me then thou hast been on me for a burden,"
10015034,10,15,34,"and if to the city thou dost turn back, and hast said to Absalom, Thy servant I am, O king; servant of thy father I `am' also hitherto, and now, I `am' also thy servant; then thou hast made void for me the counsel of Ahithophel;"
10015035,10,15,35,"and are there not with thee there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it hath been, the whole of the matter that thou hearest from the house of the king thou dost declare to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests."
10015036,10,15,36,"Lo, there with them `are' their two sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok, and Jonathan to Abiathar, and ye have sent by their hand unto me anything that ye hear.'"
10015037,10,15,37,"And Hushai, David's friend, cometh in to the city, and Absalom cometh in to Jerusalem."
10016001,10,16,1,"And David hath passed on a little from the top, and lo, Ziba, servant of Mephibosheth -- to meet him, and a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred `of' summer-fruit, and a bottle of wine."
10016002,10,16,2,"And the king saith unto Ziba, `What -- these to thee?' and Ziba saith, `The asses for the household of the king to ride on, and the bread and the summer-fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for the wearied to drink in the wilderness.'"
10016003,10,16,3,"And the king saith, `And where `is' the son of thy lord?' and Ziba saith unto the king, `Lo, he is abiding in Jerusalem, for he said, To-day do the house of Israel give back to me the kingdom of my father.'"
10016004,10,16,4,"And the king saith to Ziba, `Lo, thine `are' all that Mephibosheth hath;' and Ziba saith, `I have bowed myself -- I find grace in thine eyes, my lord, O king.'"
10016005,10,16,5,"And king David hath come in unto Bahurim, and lo, thence a man is coming out, of the family of the house of Saul, and his name `is' Shimei, son of Gera, he cometh out, coming out and reviling;"
10016006,10,16,6,"and he stoneth David with stones, and all the servants of king David, and all the people, and all the mighty men on his right and on his left."
10016007,10,16,7,"And thus said Shimei in his reviling, `Go out, go out, O man of blood, and man of worthlessness!"
10016008,10,16,8,"Jehovah hath turned back on thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned, and Jehovah doth give the kingdom in to the hand of Absalom thy son; and lo, thou `art' in thine evil, for a man of blood thou `art'.'"
10016009,10,16,9,"And Abishai son of Zeruiah saith unto the king, `Why doth this dead dog revile my lord the king? let me pass over, I pray thee, and I turn aside his head.'"
10016010,10,16,10,"And the king saith, `What -- to me and to you, O sons of Zeruiah? for -- let him revile; even because Jehovah hath said to him, Revile David; and who saith, Wherefore hast Thou done so?'"
10016011,10,16,11,"And David saith unto Abishai, and unto all his servants, `Lo, my son who came out of my bowels is seeking my life, and also surely now the Benjamite; leave him alone, and let him revile, for Jehovah hath said `so' to him;"
10016012,10,16,12,"it may be Jehovah doth look on mine affliction, and Jehovah hath turned back to me good for his reviling this day.'"
10016013,10,16,13,"And David goeth with his men in the way, and Shimei is going at the side of the hill over-against him, going on, and he revileth, and stoneth with stones over-against him, and hath dusted with dust."
10016014,10,16,14,"And the king cometh in, and all the people who `are' with him, wearied, and they are refreshed there."
10016015,10,16,15,"And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, have come in to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him,"
10016016,10,16,16,"and it cometh to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, hath come unto Absalom, that Hushai saith unto Absalom, `Let the king live! let the king live!'"
10016017,10,16,17,"And Absalom saith unto Hushai, `This thy kindness with thy friend! why hast thou not gone with thy friend?'"
10016018,10,16,18,"And Hushai saith unto Absalom, `Nay, for he whom Jehovah hath chosen, and this people, even all the men of Israel, his I am, and with him I abide;"
10016019,10,16,19,"and secondly, for whom do I labour? is it not before his son? as I served before thy father so am I before thee.'"
10016020,10,16,20,"And Absalom saith unto Ahithophel, `Give for you counsel what we do.'"
10016021,10,16,21,"And Ahithophel saith unto Absalom, `Go in unto the concubines of thy father, whom he left to keep the house, and all Israel hath heard that thou hast been abhorred by thy father, and the hands of all who `are' with thee have been strong.'"
10016022,10,16,22,"And they spread out for Absalom the tent on the roof, and Absalom goeth in unto the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel."
10016023,10,16,23,And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those days `is' as `when' one inquireth at the word of God; so `is' all the counsel of Ahithophel both to David and to Absalom.
10017001,10,17,1,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, `Let me choose, I pray thee, twelve thousand men, and I arise and pursue after David to-night,"
10017002,10,17,2,"and come upon him, and he weary and feeble-handed, and I have caused him to tremble, and all the people have fled who `are' with him, and I have smitten the king by himself,"
10017003,10,17,3,and I bring back all the people unto thee -- as the turning back of the whole `is' the man whom thou art seeking -- all the people are peace.
10017004,10,17,4,"And the thing is right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel."
10017005,10,17,5,"And Absalom saith, `Call, I pray thee, also for Hushai the Archite, and we hear what `is' in his mouth -- even he.'"
10017006,10,17,6,"And Hushai cometh in unto Absalom, and Absalom speaketh unto him, saying, `According to this word hath Ahithophel spoken; do we do his word? if not, thou -- speak thou.'"
10017007,10,17,7,"And Hushai saith unto Absalom, `Not good `is' the counsel that Ahithophel hath counselled at this time.'"
10017008,10,17,8,"And Hushai saith, `Thou hast known thy father and his men, that they `are' heroes, and they are bitter in soul as a bereaved bear in a field, and thy father `is' a man of war, and doth not lodge with the people;"
10017009,10,17,9,"lo, now, he is hidden in one of the pits, or in one of the places, and it hath been, at the falling among them at the commencement, that the hearer hath heard, and said, There hath been a slaughter among the people who `are' after Absalom;"
10017010,10,17,10,"and he also, the son of valour, whose heart `is' as the heart of the lion, doth utterly melt, for all Israel doth know that thy father is a hero, and sons of valour `are' those with him."
10017011,10,17,11,"`So that I have counselled: Let all Israel be diligently gathered unto thee, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, as the sand that `is' by the sea for multitude, and thou thyself art going in the midst;"
10017012,10,17,12,"and we have come in unto him in one of the places where he is found, and we `are' upon him as the dew falleth on the ground, and there hath not been left of him and of all the men who `are' with him even one."
10017013,10,17,13,"And if unto a city he is gathered, then they have caused all Israel to bear unto that city ropes, and we have drawn it unto the brook till that there hath not been found there even a stone.'"
10017014,10,17,14,And Absalom saith -- and all the men of Israel -- `Better `is' the counsel of Hushai the Archite than the counsel of Ahithophel;' and Jehovah willed to make void the good counsel of Ahithophel for the sake of Jehovah's bringing unto Absalom the evil.
10017015,10,17,15,"And Hushai saith unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests, `Thus and thus hath Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus I have counselled;"
10017016,10,17,16,"and now, send hastily, and declare to David, saying, Lodge not to-night in the plains of the wilderness, and also, certainly pass over, lest there be a swallowing up of the king and of all the people who are with him.'"
10017017,10,17,17,"And Jonathan and Ahimaaz are standing at En-Rogel, and the maid-servant hath gone and declared to them -- and they go and have declared `it' to king David -- for they are not able to be seen to go in to the city."
10017018,10,17,18,"And a youth seeth them, and declareth to Absalom; and they go on both of them hastily, and come in unto the house of a man in Bahurim, and he hath a well in his court, and they go down there,"
10017019,10,17,19,"and the woman taketh and spreadeth the covering over the face of the well, and spreadeth on it the ground corn, and the thing hath not been known."
10017020,10,17,20,"And the servants of Absalom come in unto the woman to the house, and say, `Where `are' Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' and the woman saith to them, `They passed over the brook of water;' and they seek, and have not found, and turn back to Jerusalem."
10017021,10,17,21,"And it cometh to pass, after their going on, that they come up out of the well, and go and declare to king David, and say unto David, `Rise ye, and pass over hastily the waters, for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.'"
10017022,10,17,22,"And David riseth, and all the people who `are' with him, and they pass over the Jordan, till the light of the morning, till one hath not been lacking who hath not passed over the Jordan."
10017023,10,17,23,"And Ahithophel hath seen that his counsel was not done, and he saddleth the ass, and riseth and goeth unto his house, unto his city, and giveth charge unto his household, and strangleth himself, and dieth, and he is buried in the burying-place of his father."
10017024,10,17,24,"And David came to Mahanaim, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him;"
10017025,10,17,25,"and Amasa hath Absalom set instead of Joab over the host, and Amasa `is' a man's son whose name is Ithra the Israelite who hath gone in unto Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab;"
10017026,10,17,26,and Israel encampeth with Absalom `in' the land of Gilead.
10017027,10,17,27,"And it cometh to pass at the coming in of David to Mahanaim, that Shobi, son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel, from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, from Rogelim,"
10017028,10,17,28,"couch, and basin, and earthen vessel, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and roasted `corn', and beans, and lentiles, and roasted `pulse',"
10017029,10,17,29,"and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, have brought nigh for David, and for the people who `are' with him to eat, for they said, `Thy people `is' hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.'"
10018001,10,18,1,"And David inspecteth the people who `are' with him, and setteth over them heads of thousands and heads of hundreds,"
10018002,10,18,2,"and David sendeth the third of the people by the hand of Joab, and the third by the hand of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and the third by the hand of Ittai the Gittite, and the king saith unto the people, `I certainly go out -- I also -- with you.'"
10018003,10,18,3,"And the people say, `Thou dost not go out, for if we utterly flee, they do not set `their' heart upon us; and if half of us die, they do not set `their' heart unto us -- for now like us `are' ten thousand; and now, better that thou be to us from the city for an helper.'"
10018004,10,18,4,"And the king saith unto them, `That which is good in your eyes I do;' and the king standeth at the side of the gate, and all the people have gone out by hundreds and by thousands,"
10018005,10,18,5,"and the king chargeth Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, `Gently -- for me, for the youth, for Absalom;' and all the people heard in the king's charging all the heads concerning Absalom."
10018006,10,18,6,"And the people goeth out into the field to meet Israel, and the battle is in a forest of Ephraim;"
10018007,10,18,7,"and smitten there are the people of Israel before the servants of David, and the smiting there is great on that day -- twenty thousand;"
10018008,10,18,8,"and the battle is there scattered over the face of all the land, and the forest multiplieth to devour among the people more than those whom the sword hath devoured in that day."
10018009,10,18,9,"And Absalom meeteth before the servants of David, and Absalom is riding on the mule, and the mule cometh in under an entangled bough of the great oak, and his head taketh hold on the oak, and he is placed between the heavens and the earth, and the mule that `is' under him hath passed on."
10018010,10,18,10,"And one man seeth, and declareth to Joab, and saith, `Lo, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.'"
10018011,10,18,11,"And Joab saith to the man who is declaring `it' to him, `And lo, thou hast seen -- and wherefore didst thou not smite him there to the earth -- and on me to give to thee ten silverlings and one girdle?'"
10018012,10,18,12,"And the man saith unto Joab, `Yea, though I am weighing on my hand a thousand silverlings, I do not put forth my hand unto the son of the king; for in our ears hath the king charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Observe ye who `is' against the youth -- against Absalom;"
10018013,10,18,13,"or I had done against my soul a vain thing, and no matter is hid from the king, and thou -- thou dost station thyself over-against.'"
10018014,10,18,14,"And Joab saith, `Not right -- I tarry before thee;' and he taketh three darts in his hand, and striketh them into the heart of Absalom, while he `is' alive, in the midst of the oak."
10018015,10,18,15,"And they go round -- ten youths bearing weapons of Joab -- and smite Absalom, and put him to death."
10018016,10,18,16,"And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and the people turneth back from pursuing after Israel, for Joab hath kept back the people;"
10018017,10,18,17,"and they take Absalom and cast him in the forest unto the great pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones, and all Israel have fled -- each to his tent."
10018018,10,18,18,"And Absalom hath taken, and setteth up for himself in his life, the standing-pillar that `is' in the king's valley, for he said, `I have no son to cause my name to be remembered;' and he calleth the standing-pillar by his own name, and it is called `The monument of Absalom' unto this day."
10018019,10,18,19,"And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, `Let me run, I pray thee, and I bear the king tidings, for Jehovah hath delivered him out of the hand of his enemies;'"
10018020,10,18,20,"and Joab saith to him, `Thou art not a man of tidings this day, but thou hast borne tidings on another day, and this day thou dost not bear tidings, because the king's son `is' dead.'"
10018021,10,18,21,"And Joab saith to Cushi, `Go, declare to the king that which thou hast seen;' and Cushi boweth himself to Joab, and runneth."
10018022,10,18,22,"And Ahimaaz son of Zadok addeth again, and saith unto Joab, `And whatever it be, let me run, I pray thee, I also, after the Cushite.' And Joab saith, `Why `is' this -- thou art running, my son, and for thee there are no tidings found?' --"
10018023,10,18,23,"`And, whatever it be, `said he,' let me run.' And he saith to him, `Run;' and Ahimaaz runneth the way of the circuit, and passeth by the Cushite."
10018024,10,18,24,"And David is sitting between the two gates, and the watchman goeth unto the roof of the gate, unto the wall, and lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, a man running by himself."
10018025,10,18,25,"And the watchman calleth, and declareth to the king, and the king saith, `If by himself, tidings `are' in his mouth;' and he cometh, coming on and drawing near."
10018026,10,18,26,"And the watchman seeth another man running, and the watchman calleth unto the gatekeeper, and saith, `Lo, a man running by himself;' and the king saith, `Also this one is bearing tidings.'"
10018027,10,18,27,"And the watchman saith, `I see the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok.' And the king saith, `This `is' a good man, and with good tidings he cometh.'"
10018028,10,18,28,"And Ahimaaz calleth and saith unto the king, `Peace;' and he boweth himself to the king, on his face, to the earth, and saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah thy God who hath shut up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.'"
10018029,10,18,29,"And the king saith, `Peace to the youth -- to Absalom?' And Ahimaaz saith, `I saw the great multitude, at the sending away of the servant of the king, even thy servant `by' Joab, and I have not known what `it is'.'"
10018030,10,18,30,"And the king saith, `Turn round, station thyself here;' and he turneth round and standeth still."
10018031,10,18,31,"And lo, the Cushite hath come, and the Cushite saith, `Let tidings be proclaimed, my lord, O king; for Jehovah hath delivered thee to-day out of the hand of all those rising up against thee.'"
10018032,10,18,32,"And the king saith unto the Cushite, `Peace to the youth -- to Absalom?' And the Cushite saith, `Let them be -- as the youth -- the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen up against thee for evil.'"
10018033,10,18,33,"And the king trembleth, and goeth up on the upper chamber of the gate, and weepeth, and thus he hath said in his going, `My son! Absalom my son; my son Absalom; oh that I had died for thee, Absalom, my son, my son.'"
10019001,10,19,1,"And it is declared to Joab, `Lo, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom;'"
10019002,10,19,2,"and the salvation on that day becometh mourning to all the people, for the people hath heard on that day, saying, `The king hath been grieved for his son.'"
10019003,10,19,3,"And the people stealeth away, on that day, to go in to the city, as the people steal away, who are ashamed, in their fleeing in battle;"
10019004,10,19,4,"and the king hath covered his face, yea, the king crieth -- a loud voice -- `My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.'"
10019005,10,19,5,"And Joab cometh in unto the king to the house, and saith, `Thou hast put to shame to-day the faces of all thy servants, those delivering thy life to-day, and the life of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the life of thy wives, and the life of thy concubines,"
10019006,10,19,6,"to love thine enemies, and to hate those loving thee, for thou hast declared to-day that thou hast no princes and servants, for I have known to-day that if Absalom `were' alive, and all of us to-day dead, that then it were right in thine eyes."
10019007,10,19,7,"`And now, rise, go out and speak unto the heart of thy servants, for by Jehovah I have sworn, that -- thou art not going out -- there doth not lodge a man with thee to-night; and this `is' worse for thee than all the evil that hath come upon thee from thy youth till now.'"
10019008,10,19,8,"And the king riseth, and sitteth in the gate, and to all the people they have declared, saying, `Lo, the king is sitting in the gate;' and all the people come in before the king, and Israel hath fled, each to his tents."
10019009,10,19,9,"And it cometh to pass, all the people are contending through all the tribes of Israel, saying, `The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, yea, he himself delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he hath fled out of the land because of Absalom,"
10019010,10,19,10,"and Absalom whom we anointed over us `is' dead in battle, and now, why are ye silent -- to bring back the king?'"
10019011,10,19,11,"And king David sent unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests, saying, `Speak ye unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye last to bring back the king unto his house? (and the word of all Israel hath come unto the king, unto his house;)"
10019012,10,19,12,"my brethren ye `are', my bone and my flesh ye `are', and why are ye last to bring back the king?"
10019013,10,19,13,"And to Amasa say ye, Art not thou my bone and my flesh? Thus doth God do to me, and thus He doth add, if thou art not head of the host before me all the days instead of Joab.'"
10019014,10,19,14,"And he inclineth the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they send unto the king, `Turn back, thou, and all thy servants.'"
10019015,10,19,15,"And the king turneth back, and cometh in unto the Jordan, and Judah hath come to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan,"
10019016,10,19,16,"and Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite, who `is' from Bahurim, hasteth, and cometh down with the men of Judah, to meet king David,"
10019017,10,19,17,"and a thousand men `are' with him from Benjamin, and Ziba servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him, and they have gone prosperously over the Jordan before the king."
10019018,10,19,18,"And passed over hath the ferry-boat to carry over the household of the king, and to do that which `is' good in his eyes, and Shimei son of Gera hath fallen before the king in his passing over into Jordan,"
10019019,10,19,19,"and saith unto the king, `Let not my lord impute to me iniquity; neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely in the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, -- for the king to set `it' unto his heart;"
10019020,10,19,20,"for thy servant hath known that I have sinned; and lo, I have come to-day, first of all the house of Joseph, to go down to meet my lord the king.'"
10019021,10,19,21,"And Abishai son of Zeruiah answereth and saith, `For this is not Shimei put to death -- because he reviled the anointed of Jehovah?'"
10019022,10,19,22,"And David saith, `What -- to me and to you, O sons of Zeruiah, that ye are to me to-day for an adversary? to-day is any man put to death in Israel? for have I not known that to-day I `am' king over Israel?'"
10019023,10,19,23,"And the king saith unto Shimei, `Thou dost not die;' and the king sweareth to him."
10019024,10,19,24,"And Mephibosheth son of Saul hath come down to meet the king -- and he prepared not his feet, nor did he prepare his upper lip, yea, his garments he washed not, even from the day of the going away of the king, till the day that he came in peace --"
10019025,10,19,25,"and it cometh to pass, when he hath come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king saith to him, `Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?'"
10019026,10,19,26,"And he saith, `My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for thy servant said, I saddle for me the ass, and ride on it, and go with the king, for thy servant `is' lame;"
10019027,10,19,27,"and he uttereth slander against thy servant unto my lord the king, and my lord the king `is' as a messenger of God; and do thou that which is good in thine eyes,"
10019028,10,19,28,"for all the house of my father have been nothing except men of death before my lord the king, and thou dost set thy servant among those eating at thy table, and what right have I any more -- even to cry any more unto the king?'"
10019029,10,19,29,"And the king saith to him, `Why dost thou speak any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba -- share ye the field.'"
10019030,10,19,30,"And Mephibosheth saith unto the king, `Yea, the whole let him take, after that my lord the king hath come in peace unto his house.'"
10019031,10,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite hath gone down from Rogelim, and passeth over the Jordan with the king, to send him away over the Jordan;"
10019032,10,19,32,"and Barzillai `is' very aged, a son of eighty years, and he hath sustained the king in his abiding in Mahanaim, for he `is' a very great man;"
10019033,10,19,33,"and the king saith unto Barzillai, `Pass thou over with me, and I have sustained thee with me in Jerusalem.'"
10019034,10,19,34,"And Barzillai saith unto the king, `How many `are' the days of the years of my life, that I go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
10019035,10,19,35,"A son of eighty years I `am' to-day; do I know between good and evil? doth thy servant taste that which I am eating, and that which I drink? do I hearken any more to the voice of singers and songstresses? and why is thy servant any more for a burden unto my lord the king?"
10019036,10,19,36,"As a little thing, thy servant doth pass over the Jordan with the king, and why doth the king recompense me this recompense?"
10019037,10,19,37,"Let, I pray thee, thy servant turn back again, and I die in mine own city, near the burying-place of my father and of my mother, -- and lo, thy servant Chimham, let him pass over with my lord the king, and do thou to him that which `is' good in thine eyes.'"
10019038,10,19,38,"And the king saith, `With me doth Chimham go over, and I do to him that which `is' good in thine eyes, yea, all that thou dost fix on me I do to thee.'"
10019039,10,19,39,"And all the people pass over the Jordan, and the king hath passed over, and the king giveth a kiss to Barzillai, and blesseth him, and he turneth back to his place."
10019040,10,19,40,"And the king passeth over to Gilgal, and Chimham hath passed over with him, and all the people of Judah, and they bring over the king, and also the half of the people of Israel."
10019041,10,19,41,"And, lo, all the men of Israel are coming unto the king, and they say unto the king, `Wherefore have they stolen thee -- our brethren, the men of Judah?' (and they bring the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him)."
10019042,10,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answer against the men of Israel, `Because the king `is' near unto us, and why `is' this -- ye are displeased about this matter? have we at all eaten of the king's `substance?' a gift hath he lifted up to us?'"
10019043,10,19,43,"And the men of Israel answer the men of Judah, and say, `Ten parts we have in the king, and also in David more than you; and wherefore have ye lightly esteemed us, that our word hath not been first to bring back our king?' And the word of the men of Judah is sharper than the word of the men of Israel."
10020001,10,20,1,"And there hath been called there a man of worthlessness, and his name `is' Sheba, son of Bichri, a Benjamite, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and saith, `We have no portion in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel.'"
10020002,10,20,2,"And every man of Israel goeth up from after David, after Sheba son of Bichri, and the men of Judah have cleaved to their king, from the Jordan even unto Jerusalem."
10020003,10,20,3,"And David cometh in unto his house at Jerusalem, and the king taketh the ten women-concubines -- whom he had left to keep the house, and putteth them in a house of ward, and sustaineth them, and unto them he hath not gone in, and they are shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood living."
10020004,10,20,4,"And the king saith unto Amasa, `Call for me the men of Judah `in' three days, and thou, stand here,'"
10020005,10,20,5,"and Amasa goeth to call Judah, and tarrieth beyond the appointed time that he had appointed him;"
10020006,10,20,6,"and David saith unto Abishai, `Now doth Sheba son of Bichri do evil to us more than Absalom; thou, take the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he have found for himself fenced cities, and delivered himself `from' our eye.'"
10020007,10,20,7,"And the men of Joab go out after him, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and all the mighty men, and they go out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri;"
10020008,10,20,8,"they `are' near the great stone that `is' in Gibeon, and Amasa hath gone before them, and Joab `is' girded; his long robe he hath put on him, and upon it a girdle -- a sword `is' fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and he hath gone out, and it falleth."
10020009,10,20,9,"And Joab saith to Amasa, `Art thou `in' peace, my brother?' and the right hand of Joab layeth hold on the beard of Amasa to give a kiss to him;"
10020010,10,20,10,"and Amasa hath not been watchful of the sword that `is' in the hand of Joab, and he smiteth him with it unto the fifth `rib', and sheddeth out his bowels to the earth, and he hath not repeated `it' to him, and he dieth; and Joab and Abishai his brother have pursued after Sheba son of Bichri."
10020011,10,20,11,"And a man hath stood by him, of the young men of Joab, and saith, `He who hath delight in Joab, and he who `is' for David -- after Joab!'"
10020012,10,20,12,"And Amasa is rolling himself in blood, in the midst of the highway, and the man seeth that all the people have stood still, and he bringeth round Amasa out of the highway to the field, and casteth over him a garment, when he hath seen that every one who hath come by him -- hath stood still."
10020013,10,20,13,"When he hath been removed out of the highway, every man hath passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri."
10020014,10,20,14,"And he passeth over through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-Maachah, and to all the Berites, and they are assembled, and go in also after him,"
10020015,10,20,15,"and they go in and lay siege against him, in Abel of Beth-Maachah, and cast up a mount against the city, and it standeth in a trench, and all the people who are `are' with Joab are destroying, to cause the wall to fall."
10020016,10,20,16,"And a wise woman calleth out of the city, `Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, and I speak unto thee.'"
10020017,10,20,17,"And he cometh near unto her, and the woman saith, `Art thou Joab?' and he saith, `I `am'.' And she saith to him, `Hear the words of thy handmaid;' and he saith, `I am hearing.'"
10020018,10,20,18,"and she speaketh, saying, `They spake often in former times, saying, Let them diligently ask at Abel, and so they finished."
10020019,10,20,19,"I `am' of the peaceable -- faithful ones of Israel; thou art seeking to destroy a city, and a mother in Israel; why dost thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?"
10020020,10,20,20,"And Joab answereth and saith, `Far be it -- far be it from me; I do not swallow up nor destroy."
10020021,10,20,21,"The matter `is' not so; for a man of the hill-country of Ephraim -- Sheba son of Bichri his name -- hath lifted up his hand against the king, against David; give ye up him by himself, and I go away from the city.' And the woman saith unto Joab, `Lo, his head is cast unto thee over the wall.'"
10020022,10,20,22,"And the woman cometh unto all the people in her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and cast `it' unto Joab, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and they are scattered from the city, each to his tents, and Joab hath turned back to Jerusalem unto the king."
10020023,10,20,23,"And Joab `is' over all the host of Israel, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is' over the Cherethite, and over the Pelethite,"
10020024,10,20,24,"and Adoram `is' over the tribute, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud `is' the remembrancer,"
10020025,10,20,25,"and Sheva `is' scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar `are' priests,"
10020026,10,20,26,"and also, Ira the Jairite hath been minister to David."
10021001,10,21,1,"And there is a famine in the days of David three years, year after year, and David seeketh the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah saith, `For Saul and for the bloody house, because that he put to death the Gibeonites.'"
10021002,10,21,2,"And the king calleth for the Gibeonites, and saith unto them -- as to the Gibeonites, they `are' not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorite, and the sons of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul seeketh to smite them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah --"
10021003,10,21,3,"yea, David saith unto the Gibeonites, `What do I do for you? and with what do I make atonement? and bless ye the inheritance of Jehovah.'"
10021004,10,21,4,"And the Gibeonites say to him, `We have no silver and gold by Saul and by his house, and we have no man to put to death in Israel;' and he saith, `What ye are saying I do to you.'"
10021005,10,21,5,"And they say unto the king, `The man who consumed us, and who devised against us -- we have been destroyed from stationing ourselves in all the border of Israel --"
10021006,10,21,6,"let there be given to us seven men of his sons, and we have hanged them before Jehovah, in the height of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah.' And the king saith, `I do give;'"
10021007,10,21,7,"and the king hath pity on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that `is' between them, between David and Jonathan son of Saul;"
10021008,10,21,8,"and the king taketh the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal daughter of Saul whom she bare to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite,"
10021009,10,21,9,"and giveth them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they hang them in the hill before Jehovah; and the seven fall together, and they have been put to death in the days of harvest, in the first `days', the commencement of barley-harvest."
10021010,10,21,10,"And Rizpah daughter of Aiah taketh the sackcloth, and stretcheth it out for herself on the rock, from the commencement of harvest till water hath been poured out upon them from the heavens, and hath not suffered a fowl of the heavens to rest upon them by day, or the beast of the field by night."
10021011,10,21,11,"And it is declared to David that which Rizpah daughter of Aiah, concubine of Saul, hath done,"
10021012,10,21,12,"and David goeth and taketh the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the possessors of Jabesh-Gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines hanged them, in the day of the Philistines smiting Saul in Gilboa;"
10021013,10,21,13,"and he bringeth up thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gather the bones of those hanged,"
10021014,10,21,14,"and bury the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in Zelah, in the burying-place of Kish his father, and do all that the king commanded, and God is entreated for the land afterwards."
10021015,10,21,15,"And again have the Philistines war with Israel, and David goeth down, and his servants with him, and they fight with the Philistines; and David is weary,"
10021016,10,21,16,"and Ishbi-Benob, who `is' among the children of the giant -- the weight of his spear `is' three hundred `shekels' weight of brass, and he is girded with a new one -- speaketh of smiting David,"
10021017,10,21,17,"and Abishai son of Zeruiah giveth help to him, and smiteth the Philistine, and putteth him to death; then swear the men of David to him, saying, `Thou dost not go out again with us to battle, nor quench the lamp of Israel.'"
10021018,10,21,18,"And it cometh to pass afterwards, that the battle is again in Gob with the Philistines, then hath Sibbechai the Hushathite smitten Saph, who `is' among the children of the giant."
10021019,10,21,19,"And the battle is again in Gob with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim, the Beth-Lehemite, smiteth `a brother of' Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear `is' like a beam of weavers."
10021020,10,21,20,"And the battle is again in Gath, and there is a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands `are' six, and the toes of his feet `are' six, twenty and four in number, and he also hath been born to the giant,"
10021021,10,21,21,"and he reproacheth Israel, and smite him doth Jonathan son of Shimeah, brother of David;"
10021022,10,21,22,"these four have been born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10022001,10,22,1,"And David speaketh to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah hath delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,"
10022002,10,22,2,"and he saith: `Jehovah `is' my rock, And my bulwark, and a deliverer to me,"
10022003,10,22,3,"My God `is' my rock -- I take refuge in Him; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge! My Saviour, from violence Thou savest me!"
10022004,10,22,4,"The Praised One, I call Jehovah: And from mine enemies I am saved."
10022005,10,22,5,"When the breakers of death compassed me, The streams of the worthless terrify me,"
10022006,10,22,6,"The cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before me have been the snares of death."
10022007,10,22,7,"In mine adversity I call Jehovah, And unto my God I call, And He heareth from His temple my voice, And my cry `is' in His ears,"
10022008,10,22,8,"And shake and tremble doth the earth, Foundations of the heavens are troubled, And are shaken, for He hath wrath!"
10022009,10,22,9,"Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils. And fire from His mouth devoureth, Brands have been kindled by it."
10022010,10,22,10,"And He inclineth heaven, and cometh down, And thick darkness `is' under His feet."
10022011,10,22,11,"And He rideth on a cherub, and doth fly, And is seen on the wings of the wind."
10022012,10,22,12,"And He setteth darkness Round about Him -- tabernacles, Darkness of waters -- thick clouds of the skies."
10022013,10,22,13,From the brightness before Him Were brands of fire kindled!
10022014,10,22,14,"Thunder from the heavens doth Jehovah, And the Most High giveth forth His voice."
10022015,10,22,15,"And He sendeth forth arrows, And scattereth them; Lightning, and troubleth them;"
10022016,10,22,16,"And seen are the streams of the sea, Revealed are foundations of the world, By the rebuke of Jehovah, From the breath of the spirit of His anger."
10022017,10,22,17,"He sendeth from above -- He taketh me, He draweth me out of many waters."
10022018,10,22,18,"He delivereth me from my strong enemy, From those hating me, For they were stronger than I."
10022019,10,22,19,"They are before me in a day of my calamity, And Jehovah is my support,"
10022020,10,22,20,"And He bringeth me out to a large place, He draweth me out for He delighted in me."
10022021,10,22,21,"Jehovah recompenseth me, According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He doth return to me."
10022022,10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not done wickedly against my God."
10022023,10,22,23,"For all His judgments `are' before me, As to His statutes, I turn not from them."
10022024,10,22,24,"And I am perfect before Him, And I keep myself from mine iniquity."
10022025,10,22,25,"And Jehovah returneth to me, According to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes."
10022026,10,22,26,"With the kind Thou shewest Thyself kind, With the perfect man Thou shewest Thyself perfect,"
10022027,10,22,27,"With the pure Thou shewest Thyself pure, And with the perverse Thou shewest Thyself a wrestler."
10022028,10,22,28,"And the poor people Thou dost save, And Thine eyes on the high causest to fall."
10022029,10,22,29,"For Thou `art' my lamp, O Jehovah, And Jehovah doth lighten my darkness."
10022030,10,22,30,"For by Thee I run -- a troop, By my God I leap a wall."
10022031,10,22,31,"God! Perfect `is' His way, The saying of Jehovah is tried, A shield He `is' to all those trusting in Him."
10022032,10,22,32,For who is God save Jehovah? And who a Rock save our God?
10022033,10,22,33,"God -- my bulwark, `my' strength, And He maketh perfect my way;"
10022034,10,22,34,"Making my feet like hinds, And on my high places causeth me to stand,"
10022035,10,22,35,"Teaching my hands for battle, And brought down was a bow of brass by mine arms,"
10022036,10,22,36,"And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy salvation, And Thy lowliness maketh me great."
10022037,10,22,37,"Thou enlargest my step under me, And mine ankles have not slidden."
10022038,10,22,38,"I pursue mine enemies and destroy them, And I turn not till they are consumed."
10022039,10,22,39,"And I consume them, and smite them, And they rise not, and fall under my feet."
10022040,10,22,40,"And Thou girdest me `with' strength for battle, Thou causest my withstanders to bow under me."
10022041,10,22,41,"And mine enemies -- Thou givest to me the neck, Those hating me -- and I cut them off."
10022042,10,22,42,"They look, and there is no saviour; Unto Jehovah, and He hath not answered them."
10022043,10,22,43,"And I beat them as dust of the earth, As mire of the streets I beat them small -- I spread them out!"
10022044,10,22,44,"And -- Thou dost deliver me From the strivings of my people, Thou placest me for a head of nations; A people I have not known do serve me."
10022045,10,22,45,"Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me, At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me."
10022046,10,22,46,"Sons of a stranger fade away, And gird themselves by their close places."
10022047,10,22,47,"Jehovah liveth, and blessed `is' my Rock, And exalted is my God -- The Rock of my salvation."
10022048,10,22,48,"God -- who is giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me,"
10022049,10,22,49,"And bringing me forth from mine enemies, Yea, above my withstanders Thou raisest me up. From a man of violence Thou deliverest me."
10022050,10,22,50,"Therefore I confess Thee, O Jehovah, among nations. And to Thy name I sing praise."
10022051,10,22,51,"Magnifying the salvations of His king, And doing loving-kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed -- unto the age!'"
10023001,10,23,1,"And these `are' the last words of David: -- `The affirmation of David son of Jesse -- And the affirmation of the man raised up -- Concerning the Anointed of the God of Jacob, And the Sweetness of the Songs of Israel:"
10023002,10,23,2,"The Spirit of Jehovah hath spoken by me, And His word `is' on my tongue."
10023003,10,23,3,"He said -- the God of Israel -- to me, He spake -- the Rock of Israel: He who is ruling over man `is' righteous, He is ruling in the fear of God."
10023004,10,23,4,"And as the light of morning he riseth, A morning sun -- no clouds! By the shining, by the rain, Tender grass of the earth!"
10023005,10,23,5,"For -- not so `is' my house with God; For -- a covenant age-during He made with me, Arranged in all things, and kept; For -- all my salvation, and all desire, For -- He hath not caused `it' to spring up."
10023006,10,23,6,"As to the worthless -- As a thorn driven away `are' all of them, For -- not by hand are they taken;"

10023008,10,23,8,"These `are' the names of the mighty ones whom David hath: sitting in the seat `is' the Tachmonite, head of the captains -- he `is' Adino, who hardened himself against eight hundred -- wounded at one time."
10023009,10,23,9,"And after him `is' Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi, of the three mighty men with David; in their exposing themselves among the Philistines -- they have been gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel go up --"
10023010,10,23,10,"he hath arisen, and smiteth among the Philistines till that his hand hath been weary, and his hand cleaveth unto the sword, and Jehovah worketh a great salvation on that day, and the people turn back after him only to strip off."
10023011,10,23,11,"And after him `is' Shammah son of Agee the Hararite, and the Philistines are gathered into a company, and there is there a portion of the field full of lentiles, and the people hath fled from the presence of the Philistines,"
10023012,10,23,12,"and he stationeth himself in the midst of the portion, and delivereth it, and smiteth the Philistines, and Jehovah worketh a great salvation."
10023013,10,23,13,"And three of the thirty heads go down and come unto the harvest, unto David, unto the cave of Adullam, and the company of the Philistines are encamping in the valley of Rephaim,"

10023015,10,23,15,"and David longeth and saith, `Who doth give me a drink of the water of the well of Beth-Lehem, which `is' by the gate?'"
10023016,10,23,16,"And the three mighty ones cleave through the camp of the Philistines, and draw water out of the well of Beth-Lehem, which `is' by the gate, and take `it' up, and bring in unto David; and he was not willing to drink it, and poureth it out to Jehovah,"
10023017,10,23,17,"and saith, `Far be it from me, O Jehovah, to do this; is it the blood of the men who are going with their lives?' and he was not willing to drink it; these `things' did the three mighty ones."
10023018,10,23,18,"And Abishai brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, he `is' head of three, and he is lifting up his spear against three hundred -- wounded, and he hath a name among three."
10023019,10,23,19,Of the three is he not the honoured? and he becometh their head; and unto the `first' three he hath not come.
10023020,10,23,20,"And Benaiah son of Jehoiada (son of a man of valour, great in deeds from Kabzeel), he hath smitten two lion-like men of Moab, and he hath gone down and smitten the lion in the midst of the pit in a day of snow."
10023021,10,23,21,"And he hath smitten the Egyptian man, a man of appearance, and in the hand of the Egyptian `is' a spear, and he goeth down unto him with a rod, and taketh violently away the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slayeth him with his own spear."

11001006,11,1,6,"and his father hath not grieved him `all' his days, saying, `Wherefore thus hast thou done?' and he also `is' of a very good form, and `his mother' bare him after Absalom."
11001007,11,1,7,"And his words are with Joab son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest, and they help after Adonijah;"
11001008,11,1,8,"and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty ones whom David hath, have not been with Adonijah."
11001009,11,1,9,"And Adonijah sacrificeth sheep and oxen and fatlings near the stone of Zoheleth, that `is' by En-Rogel, and calleth all his brethren, sons of the king, and for all the men of Judah, servants of the king;"
11001010,11,1,10,"and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty ones, and Solomon his brother, he hath not called."
11001011,11,1,11,"And Nathan speaketh unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon, saying, `Hast thou not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith hath reigned, and our lord David hath not known?"
11001012,11,1,12,"and now, come, let me counsel thee, I pray thee, and deliver thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon;"
11001013,11,1,13,"go and enter in unto king David, and thou hast said unto him, Hast thou not, my lord, O king, sworn to thy handmaid, saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne? and wherefore hath Adonijah reigned?"
11001014,11,1,14,"Lo, thou are yet speaking there with the king, and I come in after thee, and have completed thy words.'"
11001015,11,1,15,"And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto the king, to the inner chamber, and the king `is' very aged, and Abishag the Shunammite is serving the king:"
11001016,11,1,16,"and Bath-Sheba boweth and doth obeisance to the king, and the king saith, `What -- to thee?'"
11001017,11,1,17,"And she saith to him, `My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid: Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne;"
11001018,11,1,18,"and now, lo, Adonijah hath reigned, and now, my lord, O king, thou hast not known;"
11001019,11,1,19,"and he sacrificeth ox, and fatling, and sheep in abundance, and calleth for all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab head of the host -- and for Solomon thy servant he hath not called."
11001020,11,1,20,"And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel `are' on thee, to declare to them who doth sit on the throne of my lord the king after him;"
11001021,11,1,21,"and it hath been, when my lord the king lieth with his fathers, that I have been, I and my son Solomon -- `reckoned' sinners.'"
11001022,11,1,22,"And lo, she is yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the prophet hath come in;"
11001023,11,1,23,"and they declare to the king, saying, `Lo, Nathan the prophet;' and he cometh in before the king, and boweth himself to the king, on his face to the earth."
11001024,11,1,24,"And Nathan saith, `My lord, O king, thou hast said, Adonijah doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne;"
11001025,11,1,25,"for he hath gone down to-day, and doth sacrifice ox, and fatling, and sheep, in abundance, and calleth for all the sons of the king, and for the heads of the host, and for Abiathar the priest, and lo, they are eating and drinking before him, and they say, Let king Adonijah live!"
11001026,11,1,26,"`And for me -- me, thy servant, and for Zadok the priest, and for Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and for Solomon thy servant, he hath not called;"
11001027,11,1,27,"if from my lord the king this thing hath been, then thou hast not caused thy servant to know who doth sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.'"
11001028,11,1,28,"And king David answereth and saith, `Call for me for Bath-Sheba;' and she cometh in before the king, and standeth before the king."
11001029,11,1,29,"And the king sweareth and saith, `Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity;"
11001030,11,1,30,"surely as I sware to thee by Jehovah, God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon thy son doth reign after me, and he doth sit on my throne in my stead; surely so I do this day.'"
11001031,11,1,31,"And Bath-Sheba boweth -- face to the earth -- and doth obeisance to the king, and saith, `Let my lord, king David, live to the age.'"
11001032,11,1,32,"And king David saith, `Call for me for Zadok the priest, and for Nathan the prophet, and for Benaiah son of Jehoiada;' and they come in before the king."
11001033,11,1,33,"And the king saith to them, `Take with you the servants of your lord, and ye have caused Solomon my son to ride on mine own mule, and caused him to go down unto Gihon,"
11001034,11,1,34,"and anointed him there hath Zadok the priest -- and Nathan the prophet -- for king over Israel, and ye have blown with a trumpet, and said, Let king Solomon live;"
11001035,11,1,35,"and ye have come up after him, and he hath come in and hath sat on my throne, and he doth reign in my stead, and him I have appointed to be leader over Israel, and over Judah.'"
11001036,11,1,36,"And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answereth the king, and saith, `Amen! so doth Jehovah, God of my lord the king, say;"
11001037,11,1,37,"as Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, so is He with Solomon, and doth make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.'"
11001038,11,1,38,"And Zadok the priest goeth down, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and they cause Solomon to ride on the mule of king David, and cause him to go unto Gihon,"
11001039,11,1,39,"and Zadok the priest taketh the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointeth Solomon, and they blow with a trumpet, and all the people say, `Let king Solomon live.'"
11001040,11,1,40,"And all the people come up after him, and the people are piping with pipes, and rejoicing -- great joy, and the earth rendeth with their voice."
11001041,11,1,41,"And Adonijah heareth, and all those called, who `are' with him, and they have finished to eat, and Joab heareth the noise of the trumpet, and saith, `Wherefore `is' the noise of the city roaring?'"
11001042,11,1,42,"He is yet speaking, and lo, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest hath come in, and Adonijah saith, `Come in, for a man of valour thou `art', and thou bearest good tidings.'"
11001043,11,1,43,"And Jonathan answereth and saith to Adonijah, `Verily our lord king David hath caused Solomon to reign,"
11001044,11,1,44,"and the king sendeth with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and they cause him to ride on the king's mule,"
11001045,11,1,45,"and they anoint him -- Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet -- for king in Gihon, and are come up thence rejoicing, and the city is moved; it `is' the noise that ye have heard."
11001046,11,1,46,"`And also Solomon hath sat on the throne of the kingdom,"
11001047,11,1,47,"and also the servants of the king have come into bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God doth make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and his throne greater than thy throne; and the king boweth himself on the bed,"
11001048,11,1,48,"and also thus hath the king said, Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath given to-day `one' sitting on my throne, and mine eyes seeing.'"
11001049,11,1,49,"And they tremble, and rise -- all those called who `are' for Adonijah -- and go, each on his way;"
11001050,11,1,50,"and Adonijah feareth because of Solomon, and riseth, and goeth, and layeth hold on the horns of the altar."
11001051,11,1,51,"And it is declared to Solomon, saying, `Lo, Adonijah feareth king Solomon, and lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me as to-day -- he doth not put to death his servant by the sword.'"
11001052,11,1,52,"And Solomon saith, `If he becometh a virtuous man -- there doth not fall of his hair to the earth, and if evil is found in him -- then he hath died.'"
11001053,11,1,53,"And king Solomon sendeth, and they bring him down from off the altar, and he cometh in and boweth himself to king Solomon, and Solomon saith to him, `Go to thy house.'"
11002001,11,2,1,"And draw near do the days of David to die, and he chargeth Solomon his son, saying,"
11002002,11,2,2,"`I am going in the way of all the earth, and thou hast been strong, and become a man,"
11002003,11,2,3,"and kept the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commands, and His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that thou dost wisely all that thou dost, and whithersoever thou turnest,"
11002004,11,2,4,"so that Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake unto me, saying, If thy sons observe their way to walk before Me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul; saying, There is not cut off a man of thine from the throne of Israel."
11002005,11,2,5,"`And also, thou hast known that which he did to me -- Joab son of Zeruiah -- that which he did to two heads of the hosts of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether -- that he slayeth them, and maketh the blood of war in peace, and putteth the blood of war in his girdle, that `is' on his loins, and in his sandals that `are' on his feet;"
11002006,11,2,6,"and thou hast done according to thy wisdom, and dost not let his old age go down in peace to Sheol."
11002007,11,2,7,"`And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou dost do kindness, and they have been among those eating at thy table, for so they drew near unto me in my fleeing from the face of Absalom thy brother."
11002008,11,2,8,"`And lo, with thee `is' Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, and he reviled me -- a grievous reviling -- in the day of my going to Mahanaim; and he hath come down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swear to him by Jehovah, saying, I do not put thee to death by the sword;"
11002009,11,2,9,"and now, acquit him not, for a wise man thou `art', and thou hast known that which thou dost to him, and hast brought down his old age with blood to Sheol.'"
11002010,11,2,10,"And David lieth down with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David,"
11002011,11,2,11,"and the days that David hath reigned over Israel `are' forty years, in Hebron he hath reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he hath reigned thirty and three years."
11002012,11,2,12,"And Solomon hath sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom is established greatly,"
11002013,11,2,13,"and Adonijah son of Haggith cometh in unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon, and she saith, `Is thy coming peace?' and he saith, `Peace.'"
11002014,11,2,14,"And he saith, `I have a word unto thee,' and she saith, `Speak.'"
11002015,11,2,15,"And he saith, `Thou hast known that the kingdom was mine, and towards me set their faces had all Israel for reigning, and the kingdom is turned round about, and is my brother's, for from Jehovah it was his;"
11002016,11,2,16,"and now, one petition I am asking of thee -- turn not back my face;' and she saith unto him, `Speak.'"
11002017,11,2,17,"And he saith, `Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, for he doth not turn back thy face, and he doth give to me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.'"
11002018,11,2,18,"And Bath-Sheba saith, `Good; I do speak for thee unto the king.'"
11002019,11,2,19,"And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, and the king riseth to meet her, and boweth himself to her, and sitteth on his throne, and placeth a throne for the mother of the king, and she sitteth at his right hand."
11002020,11,2,20,"And she saith, `One small petition I ask of thee, turn not back my face;' and the king saith to her, `Ask, my mother, for I do not turn back thy face.'"
11002021,11,2,21,"And she saith, `Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.'"
11002022,11,2,22,"And king Solomon answereth and saith to his mother, `And why art thou asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? also ask for him the kingdom -- for he `is' mine elder brother -- even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah.'"
11002023,11,2,23,"And king Solomon sweareth by Jehovah, saying, `Thus doth God to me, and thus He doth add -- surely against his soul hath Adonijah spoken this word;"
11002024,11,2,24,"and now, Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and causeth me to sit on the throne of David my father, and who hath made for me an house as He spake -- surely to-day is Adonijah put to death.'"
11002025,11,2,25,"And king Solomon sendeth by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he falleth upon him, and he dieth."
11002026,11,2,26,"And to Abiathar the priest said the king, `To Anathoth go, unto thy fields; for a man of death thou `art', but in this day I do not put thee to death, because thou hast borne the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all that my father was afflicted in.'"
11002027,11,2,27,"And Solomon casteth out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah which He spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
11002028,11,2,28,"And the report hath come unto Joab -- for Joab hath turned aside after Adonijah, though after Absalom he did not turn aside -- and Joab fleeth unto the tent of Jehovah, and layeth hold on the horns of the altar."
11002029,11,2,29,"And it is declared to king Solomon that Joab hath fled unto the tent of Jehovah, and lo, near the altar; and Solomon sendeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, `Go, fall upon him.'"
11002030,11,2,30,"And Benaiah cometh in unto the tent of Jehovah, and saith unto him, `Thus said the king, Come out;' and he saith, `Nay, but here I die.' And Benaiah bringeth back the king word, saying, `Thus spake Joab, yea, thus he answered me.'"
11002031,11,2,31,"And the king saith to him, `Do as he hath spoken, and fall upon him, and thou hast buried him, and turned aside the causeless blood which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the house of my father;"
11002032,11,2,32,"and Jehovah hath turned back his blood on his own head, who hath fallen on two men more righteous and better than he, and slayeth them with the sword, -- and my father David knew not -- Abner son of Ner, head of the host of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, head of the host of Judah;"
11002033,11,2,33,"yea, turned back hath their blood on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed to the age; and for David, and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there is peace unto the age, from Jehovah.'"
11002034,11,2,34,"And Benaiah son of Jehoiada goeth up and falleth upon him, and putteth him to death, and he is buried in his own house in the wilderness,"
11002035,11,2,35,"and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host, and Zadok the priest hath the king put in the stead of Abiathar."
11002036,11,2,36,"And the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith to him, `Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and thou hast dwelt there, and dost not go out thence any where;"
11002037,11,2,37,"and it hath been, in the day of thy going out, and thou hast passed over the brook Kidron, thou dost certainly know that thou dost surely die -- thy blood is on thy head.'"
11002038,11,2,38,"And Shimei saith to the king, `The word `is' good; as my lord the king hath spoken so doth thy servant do;' and Shimei dwelleth in Jerusalem many days."
11002039,11,2,39,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of three years, that flee do two of the servants of Shimei unto Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath, and they declare to Shimei, saying, `Lo, thy servants `are' in Gath;'"
11002040,11,2,40,"and Shimei riseth, and saddleth his ass, and goeth to Gath, unto Achish, to seek his servants, and Shimei goeth and bringeth his servants from Gath."
11002041,11,2,41,"And it is declared to Solomon that Shimei hath gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and doth return,"
11002042,11,2,42,"and the king sendeth and calleth for Shimei, and saith unto him, `Have I not caused thee to swear by Jehovah -- and I testify against thee, saying, In the day of thy going out, and thou hast gone anywhere, thou dost certainly know that thou dost surely die; and thou sayest unto me, The word I have heard `is' good?"
11002043,11,2,43,"and wherefore hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the charge that I charged upon thee?'"
11002044,11,2,44,"And the king saith unto Shimei, `Thou hast known all the evil that thy heart hath known, which thou didest to David my father, and Jehovah hath turned back thine evil on thy head,"
11002045,11,2,45,"and king Solomon `is' blessed, and the throne of David is established before Jehovah unto the age.'"
11002046,11,2,46,"And the king chargeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he goeth out and falleth on him, and he dieth, and the kingdom is established in the hand of Solomon."
11003001,11,3,1,"And Solomon joineth in marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and taketh the daughter of Pharaoh, and bringeth her in unto the city of David, till he completeth to build his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about."
11003002,11,3,2,"Only, the people are sacrificing in high places, for there hath not been built a house for the name of Jehovah till those days."
11003003,11,3,3,"And Solomon loveth Jehovah, to walk in the statutes of David his father -- only, in high places he is sacrificing and making perfume --"
11003004,11,3,4,"and the king goeth to Gibeon, to sacrifice there, for it `is' the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings cause to ascend doth Solomon on that altar."
11003005,11,3,5,"In Gibeon hath Jehovah appeared unto Solomon, in a dream of the night, and God saith, `Ask -- what do I give to thee?'"
11003006,11,3,6,"And Solomon saith, `Thou hast done with Thy servant David my father great kindness, as he walked before Thee in truth and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee, and Thou dost keep for him this great kindness, and dost give to him a son sitting on his throne, as `at' this day."
11003007,11,3,7,"And now, O Jehovah my God, Thou hast caused thy servant to reign instead of David my father; and I `am' a little child, I do not know to go out and to come in;"
11003008,11,3,8,"and Thy servant `is' in the midst of thy people, whom Thou hast chosen, a people numerous, that is not numbered nor counted for multitude,"
11003009,11,3,9,"and Thou hast given to Thy servant an understanding heart, to judge Thy people, to discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?'"
11003010,11,3,10,"And the thing is good in the eyes of the Lord, that Solomon hath asked this thing,"
11003011,11,3,11,"and God saith unto him, `Because that thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thee many days, nor asked for thee riches, nor asked the life of thine enemies, and hast asked for thee discernment to understand judgment,"
11003012,11,3,12,"lo, I have done according to thy words; lo, I have given to thee a heart, wise and understanding, that like thee there hath not been before thee, and after thee there doth not arise like thee;"
11003013,11,3,13,"and also, that which thou hast not asked I have given to thee, both riches and honour, that there hath not been like thee a man among the kings all thy days;"
11003014,11,3,14,"and if thou dost walk in My ways to keep My statutes, and My commands, as David thy father walked, then I have prolonged thy days.'"
11003015,11,3,15,"And Solomon awaketh, and lo, a dream; and he cometh in to Jerusalem, and standeth before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and causeth to ascend burnt-offerings, and maketh peace-offerings. And he maketh a banquet for all his servants,"
11003016,11,3,16,"then come in do two women, harlots, unto the king, and stand before him,"
11003017,11,3,17,"and the one woman saith, `O, my lord, I and this woman are dwelling in one house, and I bring forth with her, in the house;"
11003018,11,3,18,"and it cometh to pass on the third day of my bringing forth, that this woman also bringeth forth, and we `are' together, there is no stranger with us in the house, save we two, in the house."
11003019,11,3,19,"And the son of this woman dieth at night, because she hath lain upon it,"
11003020,11,3,20,"and she riseth in the middle of the night, and taketh my son from beside me -- and thy handmaid is asleep -- and layeth it in her bosom, and her dead son she hath laid in my bosom;"
11003021,11,3,21,"and I rise in the morning to suckle my son, and lo, dead; and I consider concerning it in the morning, and lo, it was not my son whom I did bear.'"
11003022,11,3,22,"And the other woman saith, `Nay, but my son `is' the living, and thy son the dead;' and this `one' saith, `Nay, but thy son `is' the dead, and my son the living.' And they speak before the king."
11003023,11,3,23,"And the king saith, `This `one' saith, This `is' my son, the living, and thy son `is' the dead; and that `one' saith, Nay, but thy son `is' the dead, and my son the living.'"
11003024,11,3,24,"And the king saith, `Take for me a sword;' and they bring the sword before the king,"
11003025,11,3,25,"and the king saith, `Cut the living child into two, and give the half to the one, and the half to the other.'"
11003026,11,3,26,"And the woman whose son `is' the living one saith unto the king (for her bowels yearned over her son), yea, she saith, `O, my lord, give to her the living child, and put it not at all to death;' and this `one' saith, `Let it be neither mine or thine -- cut `it'.'"
11003027,11,3,27,"And the king answereth and saith, `Give ye to her the living child, and put it not at all to death; she `is' its mother.'"
11003028,11,3,28,"And all Israel hear of the judgment that the king hath judged, and fear because of the king, for they have seen that the wisdom of God `is' in his heart, to do judgment."
11004001,11,4,1,"And king Solomon is king over all Israel,"
11004002,11,4,2,and these `are' the heads whom he hath: Azariah son of Zadok `is' the priest;

11004021,11,4,21,"And Solomon hath been ruling over all the kingdoms, from the River `to' the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt: they are bringing nigh a present, and serving Solomon, all days of his life."
11004022,11,4,22,"And the provision of Solomon for one day is thirty cors of flour, and sixty cors of meal;"
11004023,11,4,23,"ten fat oxen, and twenty feeding oxen, and a hundred sheep, apart from hart, and roe, and fallow-deer, and fatted beasts of the stalls,"

11004029,11,4,29,"And God giveth wisdom to Solomon, and understanding, very much, and breadth of heart, as the sand that `is' on the edge of the sea;"
11004030,11,4,30,"and the wisdom of Solomon is greater than the wisdom of any of the sons of the east, and than all the wisdom of Egypt;"

11004034,11,4,34,"and there come out of all the peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth who have heard of his wisdom."
11005001,11,5,1,"And Hiram king of Tyre sendeth his servants unto Solomon, for he heard that they had anointed him for king instead of his father, for Hiram was a lover of David all the days;"
11005002,11,5,2,"and Solomon sendeth unto Hiram, saying,"
11005003,11,5,3,"`Thou hast known David my father, that he hath not been able to build a house to the name of Jehovah his God, because of the wars that have been round about him, till Jehovah's putting them under the soles of his feet."
11005004,11,5,4,"`And now, Jehovah my God hath given rest to me round about, there is no adversary nor evil occurrence,"
11005005,11,5,5,"and lo, I am saying to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son whom I appoint in thy stead on thy throne, he doth build the house for My name."
11005006,11,5,6,"`And now, command, and they cut down for me cedars out of Lebanon, and my servants are with thy servants, and the hire of thy servants I give to thee according to all that thou sayest, for thou hast known that there is not among us a man acquainted with cutting wood, like the Sidonians.'"
11005007,11,5,7,"And it cometh to pass at Hiram's hearing the words of Solomon, that he rejoiceth exceedingly, and saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah to-day, who hath given to David a wise son over this numerous people.'"
11005008,11,5,8,"And Hiram sendeth unto Solomon, saying, I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me, I do all thy desire concerning cedar-wood, and fir-wood,"
11005009,11,5,9,"my servants bring down from Lebanon to the sea, and I make them floats in the sea unto the place that thou sendest unto me, and I have spread them out there; and thou dost take `them' up, and thou dost execute my desire, to give the food of my house.'"
11005010,11,5,10,"And Hiram is giving to Solomon cedar-trees, and fir-trees, all his desire,"
11005011,11,5,11,"and Solomon hath given to Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat, food for his house, and twenty cors of beaten oil; thus doth Solomon give to Hiram year by year."
11005012,11,5,12,"And Jehovah hath given wisdom to Solomon as He spake to him, and there is peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they make a covenant both of them."
11005013,11,5,13,"And king Solomon lifteth up a tribute out of all Israel, and the tribute is thirty thousand men,"
11005014,11,5,14,"and he sendeth them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month, by changes, a month they are in Lebanon, two months in their own house; and Adoniram `is' over the tribute."
11005015,11,5,15,"And king Solomon hath seventy thousand bearing burdens, and eighty thousand hewing in the mountain,"
11005016,11,5,16,"apart from the heads of the officers of Solomon, who `are' over the work, three thousand and three hundred, those ruling over the people who are working in the business."
11005017,11,5,17,"And the king commandeth, and they bring great stones, precious stone, to lay the foundation of the house, hewn stones;"
11005018,11,5,18,"and the builders of Solomon, and the builders of Hiram, and the Giblites hew, and prepare the wood and the stones to build the house."
11006001,11,6,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the four hundred and eightieth year of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year -- in the month of Zif, it `is' the second month -- of the reigning of Solomon over Israel, that he buildeth the house for Jehovah."
11006002,11,6,2,"As to the house that king Solomon hath built for Jehovah, sixty cubits `is' its length, and twenty its breadth, and thirty cubits its height."
11006003,11,6,3,"As to the porch on the front of the temple of the house, twenty cubits `is' its length on the front of the breadth of the house; ten by the cubit `is' its breadth on the front of the house;"
11006004,11,6,4,and he maketh for the house windows of narrow lights.
11006005,11,6,5,"And he buildeth against the wall of the house a couch round about, `even' the walls of the house round about, of the temple and of the oracle, and maketh sides round about."
11006006,11,6,6,"The lowest couch, five by the cubit `is' its breadth; and the middle, six by the cubit `is' its breadth; and the third, seven by the cubit `is' its breadth, for withdrawings he hath put to the house round about, without -- not to lay hold on the walls of the house."
11006007,11,6,7,"And the house, in its being built, of perfect stone brought `thither' hath been built, and hammer, and the axe -- any instrument of iron -- was not heard in the house, in its being built."
11006008,11,6,8,"The opening of the middle side `is' at the right shoulder of the house, and with windings they go up on the middle one, and from the middle one unto the third."
11006009,11,6,9,"And he buildeth the house, and completeth it, and covereth the house `with' beams and rows of cedars."
11006010,11,6,10,"And he buildeth the couch against all the house, five cubits `is' its height, and it taketh hold of the house by cedar-wood."
11006011,11,6,11,"And the word of Jehovah is unto Solomon, saying,"
11006012,11,6,12,"`This house that thou art building -- if thou dost walk in My statutes, and My judgments dost do, yea, hast done all My commands, to walk in them, then I have established My word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father,"
11006013,11,6,13,"and have tabernacled in the midst of the sons of Israel, and do not forsake My people Israel.'"
11006014,11,6,14,And Solomon buildeth the house and completeth it;
11006015,11,6,15,"and he buildeth the walls of the house within with beams of cedar, from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling; he hath overlaid with wood the inside, and covereth the floor of the house with ribs of fir."
11006016,11,6,16,"And he buildeth the twenty cubits on the sides of the house with ribs of cedar, from the floor unto the walls; and he buildeth for it within, for the oracle, for the holy of holies."
11006017,11,6,17,"And forty by the cubit was the house, it `is' the temple before `it'."
11006018,11,6,18,"And the cedar for the house within `is' carvings of knobs and openings of flowers; the whole `is' cedar, there is not a stone seen."
11006019,11,6,19,"And the oracle in the midst of the house within he hath prepared, to put there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah."
11006020,11,6,20,"And before the oracle `is' twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits `is' its height; and he overlayeth it with gold refined, and overlayeth the altar with cedar."
11006021,11,6,21,"And Solomon overlayeth the house within with gold refined, and causeth `it' to pass over in chains of gold before the oracle, and overlayeth it with gold."
11006022,11,6,22,"And the whole of the house he hath overlaid with gold, till the completion of all the house; and the whole of the altar that the oracle hath, he hath overlaid with gold."
11006023,11,6,23,"And he maketh within the oracle two cherubs, of the oil-tree, ten cubits `is' their height;"
11006024,11,6,24,"and five cubits `is' the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub, ten cubits from the ends of its wings even unto the ends of its wings;"
11006025,11,6,25,"and ten by the cubit `is' the second cherub, one measure and one form `are' to the two cherubs,"
11006026,11,6,26,"the height of the one cherub `is' ten by the cubit, and so `is' the second cherub;"
11006027,11,6,27,"and he setteth the cherubs in the midst of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubs, and a wing of the one cometh against the wall, and a wing of the second cherub is coming against the second wall, and their wings `are' unto the midst of the house, coming wing against wing;"
11006028,11,6,28,"and he overlayeth the cherubs with gold,"
11006029,11,6,29,"and all the walls of the house round about he hath carved with openings of carvings, cherubs, and palm trees, and openings of flowers, within and without."
11006030,11,6,30,"And the floor of the house he hath overlaid with gold, within and without;"
11006031,11,6,31,"as to the opening of the oracle, he made doors of the oil-tree; the lintel, side-posts, a fifth."
11006032,11,6,32,"And the two doors `are' of the oil-tree, and he hath carved upon them carvings of cherubs, and palm-trees, and openings of flowers, and overlaid with gold, and he causeth the gold to go down on the cherubs and on the palm-trees."
11006033,11,6,33,"And so he hath made for the opening of the temple, side-posts of the oil-tree, from the fourth."
11006034,11,6,34,"And the two doors `are' of fir-tree, the two sides of the one door are revolving, and the two hangings of the second door are revolving."
11006035,11,6,35,"And he hath carved cherubs, and palms, and openings of flowers, and overlaid with straightened gold the graved work."
11006036,11,6,36,"And he buildeth the inner court, three rows of hewn work, and a row of beams of cedar."
11006037,11,6,37,"In the fourth year hath the house of Jehovah been founded, in the month Zif,"
11006038,11,6,38,"and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul -- `that is' the eighth month -- hath the house been finished in all its matters, and in all its ordinances, and he buildeth it seven years."
11007001,11,7,1,"And his own house hath Solomon built thirteen years, and he finisheth all his house."
11007002,11,7,2,"And he buildeth the house of the forest of Lebanon; a hundred cubits `is' its length, and fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height, on four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar-beams on the pillars;"
11007003,11,7,3,"and `it is' covered with cedar above, on the sides that `are' on the forty and five pillars, fifteen in the row."
11007004,11,7,4,"And windows `are' in three rows, and sight `is' over-against sight three times."
11007005,11,7,5,And all the openings and the side-posts `are' square -- windows; and sight `is' over-against sight three times.
11007006,11,7,6,"And the porch of the pillars he hath made; fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth, and the porch `is' before them, and pillars and a thick place `are' before them."
11007007,11,7,7,"And the porch of the throne where he judgeth -- the porch of judgment -- he hath made, and `it is' covered with cedar from the floor unto the floor."
11007008,11,7,8,"As to his house where he dwelleth, the other court `is' within the porch -- as this work it hath been; and a house he maketh for the daughter of Pharaoh -- whom Solomon hath taken -- like this porch."
11007009,11,7,9,"All these `are' of precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, sawn with a saw, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and at the outside, unto the great court."
11007010,11,7,10,"And the foundation `is' of precious stone, great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits;"
11007011,11,7,11,"and above `are' precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, and cedar;"
11007012,11,7,12,"and the great court round about `is' three rows of hewn work, and a row of cedar-beams, even for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and for the porch of the house."
11007013,11,7,13,And king Solomon sendeth and taketh Hiram out of Tyre --
11007014,11,7,14,"he `is' son of a woman, a widow, of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and he is filled with the wisdom and the understanding, and the knowledge to do all work in brass -- and he cometh unto king Solomon, and doth all his work."
11007015,11,7,15,"And he formeth the two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits `is' the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits doth compass the second pillar."
11007016,11,7,16,"And two chapiters he hath made to put on the tops of the pillars, cast in brass; five cubits the height of the one chapiter, and five cubits the height of the second chapiter."
11007017,11,7,17,"Nets of net-work, wreaths of chain-work `are' for the chapiters that `are' on the top of the pillars, seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the second chapiter."
11007018,11,7,18,"And he maketh the pillars, and two rows round about on the one net-work, to cover the chapiters that `are' on the top, with the pomegranates, and so he hath made for the second chapiter."
11007019,11,7,19,"And the chapiters that `are' on the top of the pillars `are' of lily-work in the porch, four cubits;"
11007020,11,7,20,"and the chapiters on the two pillars also above, over-against the protuberance that `is' beside the net; and the pomegranates `are' two hundred, in rows round about on the second chapiter."
11007021,11,7,21,"And he raiseth up the pillars for the porch of the temple, and he raiseth up the right pillar, and calleth its name Jachin, and he raiseth up the left pillar, and calleth its name Boaz;"
11007022,11,7,22,and on the top of the pillars `is' lily-work; and the work of the pillars `is' completed.
11007023,11,7,23,"And he maketh the molten sea, ten by the cubit from its edge unto its edge; `it is' round all about, and five by the cubit `is' its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it round about;"
11007024,11,7,24,"and knops beneath its brim round about are compassing it, ten by the cubit, going round the sea round about; in two rows `are' the knops, cast in its being cast."
11007025,11,7,25,"It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea `is' upon them above, and all their hinder parts `are' inward."
11007026,11,7,26,"And its thickness `is' an handbreadth, and its edge as the work of the edge of a cup, flowers of lilies; two thousand baths it containeth."
11007027,11,7,27,"And he maketh the ten bases of brass; four by the cubit `is' the length of the one base, and four by the cubit its breadth, and three by the cubit its height."
11007028,11,7,28,"And this `is' the work of the base: they have borders, and the borders `are' between the joinings;"
11007029,11,7,29,"and on the borders that `are' between the joinings `are' lions, oxen, and cherubs, and on the joinings a base above, and beneath the lions and the oxen `are' additions -- sloping work."
11007030,11,7,30,"And four wheels of brass `are' to the one base, and axles of brass; and its four corners have shoulders -- under the laver `are' the molten shoulders, beside each addition."
11007031,11,7,31,"And its mouth within the chapiter and above `is' by the cubit, and its mouth `is' round, the work of the base, a cubit and half a cubit; and also on its mouth `are' carvings and their borders, square, not round."
11007032,11,7,32,"And the four wheels `are' under the borders, and the spokes of the wheels `are' in the base, and the height of the one wheel `is' a cubit and half a cubit."
11007033,11,7,33,"And the work of the wheels `is' as the work of the wheel of a chariot, their spokes, and their axles, and their felloes, and their naves; the whole `is' molten."
11007034,11,7,34,And four shoulders `are' unto the four corners of the one base; out of the base `are' its shoulders.
11007035,11,7,35,And in the top of the base `is' the half of a cubit in the height all round about; and on the top of the base its spokes and its borders `are' of the same.
11007036,11,7,36,"And he openeth on the tablets of its spokes, and on its borders, cherubs, lions, and palm-trees, according to the void space of each, and additions round about."
11007037,11,7,37,"Thus he hath made the ten bases; one casting, one measure, one form, have they all."
11007038,11,7,38,"And he maketh ten lavers of brass; forty baths doth the one laver contain, four by the cubit `is' the one laver, one laver on the one base `is' to the ten bases;"
11007039,11,7,39,"and he putteth the five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house, and the sea he hath put on the right side of the house, eastward -- over-against the south."
11007040,11,7,40,"And Hiram maketh the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls; and Hiram completeth to do all the work that he made for king Solomon, `for' the house of Jehovah;"
11007041,11,7,41,"pillars two, and bowls of the chapiters that `are' on the top of the pillars two, and the nets two, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that `are' on the top of the pillars;"
11007042,11,7,42,"and the pomegranates four hundred for the two nets, two rows of pomegranates for the one net, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that `are' on the front of the pillars;"
11007043,11,7,43,"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;"
11007044,11,7,44,"and the one sea, the twelve oxen under the sea,"
11007045,11,7,45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls; and all these vessels, that Hiram hath made to king Solomon `for' the house of Jehovah, `are' of brass -- polished."
11007046,11,7,46,"In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zarthan."
11007047,11,7,47,"And Solomon placeth the whole of the vessels; because of the very great abundance, the weight of the brass hath not been searched out."
11007048,11,7,48,"And Solomon maketh all the vessels that `are' in the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table -- on which `is' the bread of the Presence -- of gold,"
11007049,11,7,49,"and the candlesticks, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle, of refined gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,"
11007050,11,7,50,"and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of refined gold, and the hinges for the doors of the inner-house, for the holy of holies, for the doors of the house of the temple, of gold."
11007051,11,7,51,"And it is complete -- all the work that king Solomon hath made `for' the house of Jehovah, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of David his father; the silver, and the gold, and the vessels he hath put in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah."
11008001,11,8,1,"Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto king Solomon, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David -- it `is' Zion;"
11008002,11,8,2,"and all the men of Israel are assembled unto king Solomon, in the month of Ethanim, in the festival -- `is' the seventh month."
11008003,11,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel come in, and the priests lift up the ark,"
11008004,11,8,4,"and bring up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that `are' in the tent, yea, the priests and the Levites bring them up."
11008005,11,8,5,"And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are met unto him `are' with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered for multitude."
11008006,11,8,6,"And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;"
11008007,11,8,7,"for the cherubs are spreading forth two wings unto the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves from above;"
11008008,11,8,8,"and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen from the holy `place' on the front of the oracle, and are not seen without, and they are there unto this day."
11008009,11,8,9,"There is nothing in the ark, only the two tables of stone which Moses put there in Horeb, when Jehovah covenanted with the sons of Israel in their going out of the land of Egypt."
11008010,11,8,10,"And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from the holy `place', that the cloud hath filled the house of Jehovah,"
11008011,11,8,11,"and the priests have not been able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of Jehovah."
11008012,11,8,12,"Then said Solomon, `Jehovah hath said to dwell in thick darkness;"
11008013,11,8,13,I have surely built a house of habitation for Thee; a fixed place for Thine abiding to the ages.'
11008014,11,8,14,"And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel is standing."
11008015,11,8,15,"And he saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, who spake by His mouth with David my father, and by His hand hath fulfilled `it', saying,"
11008016,11,8,16,"From the day that I brought out My people, even Israel, from Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house for My name being there; and I fix on David to be over My people Israel."
11008017,11,8,17,"`And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,"
11008018,11,8,18,"and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast done well that it hath been with thy heart;"
11008019,11,8,19,"only, thou dost not build the house, but thy son who is coming out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name."
11008020,11,8,20,"`And Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake, and I am risen up instead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and build the house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,"
11008021,11,8,21,"and set there a place for the ark, where `is' the covenant of Jehovah which He made with our fathers in His bringing them out from the land of Egypt.'"
11008022,11,8,22,"And Solomon standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth his hands towards the heavens,"
11008023,11,8,23,"and saith, `Jehovah, God of Israel, there is not a God like Thee, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Thy servants, those walking before Thee with all their heart,"
11008024,11,8,24,"who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him; yea, Thou speakest with Thy mouth, and with Thy hand hast fulfilled `it', as `at' this day."
11008025,11,8,25,"`And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel -- only, if thy sons watch their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me."
11008026,11,8,26,"`And now, O God of Israel, let it be established, I pray Thee, Thy word which Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, David my father."
11008027,11,8,27,"But, is it true? -- God dwelleth on the earth! lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens do not contain Thee, how much less this house which I have builded!"
11008028,11,8,28,"`Then thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer which Thy servant is praying before Thee to-day,"
11008029,11,8,29,"for Thine eyes being open towards this house night and day, towards the place of which Thou hast said, My Name is there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant prayeth towards this place."
11008030,11,8,30,"`Then Thou hast hearkened unto the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, which they pray towards this place; yea, Thou dost hearken in the place of Thy dwelling, in the heavens -- and Thou hast hearkened, and hast forgiven,"
11008031,11,8,31,"that which a man sinneth against his neighbour, and he hath lifted up upon him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath hath come in before Thine altar in this house,"
11008032,11,8,32,"then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Thy servants, to declare wicked the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
11008033,11,8,33,"`In Thy people Israel being smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back unto Thee, and have confessed Thy name, and prayed, and made supplication unto Thee in this house,"
11008034,11,8,34,"then thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy people Israel, and brought them back unto the ground that Thou gavest to their fathers."
11008035,11,8,35,"`In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Thy name, and from their sin turn back, for Thou dost afflict them,"
11008036,11,8,36,"then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, for Thou directest them the good way in which they go, and hast given rain on Thy land which Thou hast given to Thy people for inheritance."
11008037,11,8,37,"`Famine -- when it is in the land; pestilence -- when it is; blasting, mildew, locust; caterpillar -- when it is; when its enemy hath distressed it in the land `in' its gates, any plague, any sickness, --"
11008038,11,8,38,"any prayer, any supplication that `is' of any man of all Thy people Israel, who know each the plague of his own heart, and hath spread his hands towards this house,"
11008039,11,8,39,"then Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast done, and hast given to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest, (for Thou hast known -- Thyself alone -- the heart of all the sons of man),"
11008040,11,8,40,so that they fear Thee all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.
11008041,11,8,41,"`And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and hath come from a land afar off for Thy name's sake --"
11008042,11,8,42,"(for they hear of Thy great name, and of Thy strong hand, and of Thy stretched-out arm) -- and he hath come in and prayed towards this house,"
11008043,11,8,43,"Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee like Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name hath been called on this house which I have builded."
11008044,11,8,44,"`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemy, in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto Jehovah the way of the city which thou hast fixed on, and of the house which I have builded for Thy name;"
11008045,11,8,45,"then Thou hast heard in the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause."
11008046,11,8,46,"`When they sin against Thee (for there is not a man who sinneth not), and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them up before an enemy, and they have taken captive their captivity unto the land of the enemy far off or near;"
11008047,11,8,47,"and they have turned `it' back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee, in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned and done perversely -- we have done wickedly;"
11008048,11,8,48,"yea, they have turned back unto Thee, with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed unto Thee the way of their land, which Thou gavest to their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have builded for Thy name:"
11008049,11,8,49,"`Then Thou hast heard in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause,"
11008050,11,8,50,"and hast forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee, even all their transgressions which they have transgressed against Thee, and hast given them mercies before their captors, and they have had mercy `on' them --"
11008051,11,8,51,"(for Thy people and Thy inheritance `are' they, whom Thou didst bring out of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron) --"
11008052,11,8,52,"for Thine eyes being open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all they call unto Thee for;"
11008053,11,8,53,"for Thou hast separated them to Thyself for an inheritance, out of all the peoples of the earth, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, in Thy bringing out our fathers from Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.'"
11008054,11,8,54,"And it cometh to pass, at Solomon's finishing to pray unto Jehovah all this prayer and supplication, he hath risen from before the altar of Jehovah, from bending on his knees, and his hands spread out to the heavens,"
11008055,11,8,55,"and he standeth and blesseth all the assembly of Israel `with' a loud voice, saying,"
11008056,11,8,56,"`Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He hath spoken; there hath not fallen one word of all His good word, which He spake by the hand of Moses his servant."
11008057,11,8,57,`Jehovah our God is with us as He hath been with our fathers; He doth not forsake us nor leave us;
11008058,11,8,58,"to incline our heart unto Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers;"
11008059,11,8,59,"and these my words with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, are near unto Jehovah our God by day and by night, to maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, the matter of a day in its day;"
11008060,11,8,60,"for all the peoples of the earth knowing that Jehovah, He `is' God; there is none else;"
11008061,11,8,61,"and your heart hath been perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commands, as `at' this day.'"
11008062,11,8,62,And the king and all Israel with him are sacrificing a sacrifice before Jehovah;
11008063,11,8,63,"and Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he hath sacrificed to Jehovah, oxen, twenty and two thousand, and sheep, a hundred and twenty thousand; and the king and all the sons of Israel dedicate the house of Jehovah."
11008064,11,8,64,"On that day hath the king sanctified the middle of the court that `is' before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peace-offerings; for the altar of brass that `is' before Jehovah `is' too little to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peace-offerings."
11008065,11,8,65,"And Solomon maketh, at that time, the festival -- and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt -- before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days; fourteen days."
11008066,11,8,66,"On the eighth day he hath sent the people away, and they bless the king, and go to their tents, rejoicing and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah hath done to David His servant, and to Israel His people."
11009001,11,9,1,"And it cometh to pass, at Solomon's finishing to build the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the desire of Solomon that he delighted to do,"
11009002,11,9,2,"that Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon a second time, as He appeared unto him in Gibeon,"
11009003,11,9,3,"and Jehovah saith unto him, `I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication with which thou hast made supplication before Me; I have hallowed this house that thou hast built to put My name there -- unto the age, and Mine eyes and My heart have been there all the days."
11009004,11,9,4,"`And thou -- if thou dost walk before Me as David thy father walked, in simplicity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee -- My statutes and My judgments thou dost keep --"
11009005,11,9,5,"then I have established the throne of thy kingdom over Israel -- to the age, as I spake unto David thy father, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from `being' on the throne of Israel."
11009006,11,9,6,"`If ye at all turn back -- you and your sons -- from after Me, and keep not My commands -- My statutes, that I have set before you, and ye have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them,"
11009007,11,9,7,"then I have cut off Israel from the face of the ground that I have given to them, and the house that I have hallowed for My name I send away from My presence, and Israel hath been for a simile and for a byword among all the peoples;"
11009008,11,9,8,"as to this house, `that' is high, every one passing by it is astonished, and hath hissed, and they have said, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?"
11009009,11,9,9,"and they have said, Because that they have forsaken Jehovah their God, who brought out their fathers from the land of Egypt, and they lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves to them, and serve them; therefore hath Jehovah brought in upon them all this evil.'"
11009010,11,9,10,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of twenty years, that Solomon hath built the two houses, the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king."
11009011,11,9,11,"Hiram king of Tyre hath assisted Solomon with cedar-trees, and with fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire; then doth king Solomon give to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
11009012,11,9,12,"And Hiram cometh out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon hath given to him, and they have not been right in his eyes,"
11009013,11,9,13,"and he saith, `What `are' these cities that thou hast given to me, my brother?' and one calleth them the land of Cabul unto this day."
11009014,11,9,14,And Hiram sendeth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
11009015,11,9,15,"And this `is' the matter of the tribute that king Solomon hath lifted up, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer,"
11009016,11,9,16,"(Pharaoh king of Egypt hath gone up and doth capture Gezer, and doth burn it with fire, and the Canaanite who is dwelling in the city he hath slain, and giveth it `with' presents to his daughter, wife of Solomon.)"
11009017,11,9,17,"And Solomon buildeth Gezer, and Beth-Horon the lower,"
11009018,11,9,18,"and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land;"
11009019,11,9,19,"and all the cities of stores that king Solomon hath, and the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
11009020,11,9,20,"The whole of the people that is left of the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who `are' not of the sons of Israel --"
11009021,11,9,21,"their sons who are left behind them in the land, whom the sons of Israel have not been able to devote -- he hath even lifted up `on' them a tribute of service unto this day."
11009022,11,9,22,"And out of the sons of Israel Solomon hath not appointed a servant, for they `are' the men of war, and his servants, and his heads, and his captains, and the heads of his chariots, and his horsemen."
11009023,11,9,23,"These `are' the heads of the officers who `are' over the work of Solomon, fifty and five hundred, those ruling among the people who are labouring in the work."
11009024,11,9,24,"Only, the daughter of Pharaoh went up out of the city of David unto her house that `Solomon' built for her; then he built Millo."
11009025,11,9,25,"And Solomon caused to ascend, three times in a year, burnt-offerings and peace-offerings on the altar that he built to Jehovah, and he perfumed it with that which `is' before Jehovah, and finished the house."
11009026,11,9,26,"And a navy hath king Solomon made in Ezion-Geber, that is beside Eloth, on the edge of the Sea of Suph, in the land of Edom."
11009027,11,9,27,"And Hiram sendeth in the navy his servants, shipmen knowing the sea, with servants of Solomon,"
11009028,11,9,28,"and they come in to Ophir and take thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and bring `it' in unto king Solomon."
11010001,11,10,1,"And the queen of Sheba is hearing of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, and cometh to try him with enigmas,"
11010002,11,10,2,"and she cometh to Jerusalem, with a very great company, camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stone, and she cometh unto Solomon, and speaketh unto him all that hath been with her heart."
11010003,11,10,3,And Solomon declareth to her all her matters -- there hath not been a thing hid from the king that he hath not declared to her.
11010004,11,10,4,"And the queen of Sheba seeth all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he built,"
11010005,11,10,5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his butlers, and his burnt-offering that he causeth to ascend in the house of Jehovah, and there hath not been in her any more spirit."
11010006,11,10,6,"And she saith unto the king, `True hath been the word that I heard in my land, concerning thy matters and thy wisdom;"
11010007,11,10,7,"and I gave no credence to the words till that I have come, and my eyes see, and lo, it was not declared to me -- the half; thou hast added wisdom and goodness unto the report that I heard."
11010008,11,10,8,"O the happiness of thy men, O the happiness of thy servants -- these -- who are standing before thee continually, who are hearing thy wisdom!"
11010009,11,10,9,"Jehovah thy God is blessed who delighted in thee, to put thee on the throne of Israel; in Jehovah's loving Israel to the age He doth set thee for king, to do judgment and righteousness."
11010010,11,10,10,"And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came not like that spice any more for abundance that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
11010011,11,10,11,"And also, the navy of Hiram that bore gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir almug-trees very many, and precious stone;"
11010012,11,10,12,"and the king maketh the almug-trees a support for the house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and psalteries for singers; there have not come such almug-trees, nor have there been seen `such' unto this day."
11010013,11,10,13,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which he gave to her as a memorial of king Solomon, and she turneth and goeth to her land, she and her servants."
11010014,11,10,14,"And the weight of the gold that hath come to Solomon in one year is six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,"
11010015,11,10,15,"apart from `that of' the tourists, and of the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the land."
11010016,11,10,16,And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold -- six hundred of gold go up on the one target;
11010017,11,10,17,and three hundred shields of alloyed gold -- three pounds of gold go up on the one shield; and the king putteth them `in' the house of the forest of Lebanon.
11010018,11,10,18,"And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and overlayeth it with refined gold;"
11010019,11,10,19,"six steps hath the throne, and a round top `is' to the throne behind it, and hands `are' on this `side' and on that, unto the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,"
11010020,11,10,20,"and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps, on this `side' and on that; it hath not been made so for any kingdom."
11010021,11,10,21,"And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon `are' of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon `are' of refined gold -- there are none of silver; it was not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything,"
11010022,11,10,22,"for a navy of Tarshish hath the king at sea with a navy of Hiram; once in three years cometh the navy of Tarshish, bearing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
11010023,11,10,23,"And king Solomon is greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom,"
11010024,11,10,24,"and all the earth is seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom that God hath put into his heart,"
11010025,11,10,25,"and they are bringing each his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, the matter of a year in a year."
11010026,11,10,26,"And Solomon gathereth chariots, and horsemen, and he hath a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem."
11010027,11,10,27,"And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he hath made as the sycamores that `are' in the low country, for abundance."
11010028,11,10,28,"And the outgoing of the horses that king Solomon hath `is' from Egypt, and from Keveh; merchants of the king take from Keveh at a price;"
11010029,11,10,29,"and a chariot cometh up and cometh out of Egypt for six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram; by their hand they bring out."
11011001,11,11,1,"And king Solomon hath loved many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh, females of Moab, Ammon, Edom, Zidon, `and' of the Hittites,"
11011002,11,11,2,"of the nations of which Jehovah said unto the sons of Israel, `Ye do not go in to them, and they do not go in to you; surely they turn aside your heart after their gods;' to them hath Solomon cleaved for love."
11011003,11,11,3,"And he hath women, princesses, seven hundred, and concubines three hundred; and his wives turn aside his heart."
11011004,11,11,4,"And it cometh to pass, at the time of the old age of Solomon, his wives have turned aside his heart after other gods, and his heart hath not been perfect with Jehovah his God, like the heart of David his father."
11011005,11,11,5,"And Solomon goeth after Ashtoreth god`dess' of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites;"
11011006,11,11,6,"and Solomon doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and hath not been fully after Jehovah, like David his father."
11011007,11,11,7,"Then doth Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the hill that `is' on the front of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon;"
11011008,11,11,8,"and so he hath done for all his strange women, who are perfuming and sacrificing to their gods."
11011009,11,11,9,"And Jehovah sheweth Himself angry with Solomon, for his heart hath turned aside from Jehovah, God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,"
11011010,11,11,10,"and given a charge unto him concerning this thing, not to go after other gods; and he hath not kept that which Jehovah commanded,"
11011011,11,11,11,"and Jehovah saith to Solomon, `Because that this hath been with thee, and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes that I charged upon thee, I surely rend the kingdom from thee, and have given it to thy servant."
11011012,11,11,12,"`Only, in thy days I do it not, for the sake of David thy father; out of the hand of thy son I rend it;"
11011013,11,11,13,"only all the kingdom I do not rend away; one tribe I give to thy son, for the sake of David My servant, and for the sake of Jerusalem, that I have chosen.'"
11011014,11,11,14,"And Jehovah raiseth up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; of the seed of the king `is' he in Edom;"
11011015,11,11,15,"and it cometh to pass, in David's being with Edom, in the going up of Joab head of the host to bury the slain, that he smiteth every male in Edom --"
11011016,11,11,16,"for six months did Joab abide there, and all Israel, till the cutting off of every male in Edom --"
11011017,11,11,17,"and Hadad fleeth, he and certain Edomites, of the servants of his father, with him, to go in to Egypt, and Hadad `is' a little youth,"
11011018,11,11,18,"and they rise out of Midian, and come into Paran, and take men with them out of Paran, and come in to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he giveth to him a house, and bread hath commanded for him, and land hath given to him."
11011019,11,11,19,"And Hadad findeth grace in the eyes of Pharaoh exceedingly, and he giveth to him a wife, the sister of his own wife, sister of Tahpenes the mistress;"
11011020,11,11,20,"and the sister of Tahpenes beareth to him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes weaneth him within the house of Pharaoh, and Genubath is in the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the sons of Pharaoh."
11011021,11,11,21,"And Hadad hath heard in Egypt that David hath lain with his fathers, and that Joab head of the host is dead, and Hadad saith unto Pharaoh, `Send me away, and I go unto my land.'"
11011022,11,11,22,"And Pharaoh saith to him, `But, what art thou lacking with me, that lo, thou art seeking to go unto thine own land?' and he saith, `Nay, but thou dost certainly send me away.'"
11011023,11,11,23,"And God raiseth to him an adversary, Rezon son of Eliadah, who hath fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his lord,"
11011024,11,11,24,"and gathereth unto himself men, and is head of a troop in David's slaying them, and they go to Damascus, and dwell in it, and reign in Damascus;"
11011025,11,11,25,"and he is an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, (besides the evil that Hadad `did'), and he cutteth off in Israel, and reigneth over Aram."
11011026,11,11,26,"And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda -- the name of whose mother `is' Zeruah, a widow woman -- servant to Solomon, he also lifteth up a hand against the king;"
11011027,11,11,27,"and this `is' the thing `for' which he lifted up a hand against the king: Solomon built Millo -- he shut up the breach of the city of David his father,"
11011028,11,11,28,"and the man Jeroboam `is' mighty in valour, and Solomon seeth the young man that he is doing business, and appointeth him over all the burden of the house of Joseph."
11011029,11,11,29,"And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Jeroboam hath gone out from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite, the prophet, findeth him in the way, and he is covering himself with a new garment; and both of them `are' by themselves in a field,"
11011030,11,11,30,"and Ahijah layeth hold on the new garment that `is' on him, and rendeth it -- twelve pieces,"
11011031,11,11,31,"and saith to Jeroboam, `Take to thee ten pieces, for thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, lo, I am rending the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and have given to thee the ten tribes,"
11011032,11,11,32,"and the one tribe he hath for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have fixed on, out of all the tribes of Israel."
11011033,11,11,33,"`Because they have forsaken Me, and bow themselves to Ashtoreth, god`dess' of the Zidonians, to Chemosh god of Moab, and to Milcom god of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do that which `is' right in Mine eyes, and My statutes and My judgments, like David his father."
11011034,11,11,34,"`And I do not take the whole of the kingdom out of his hand, for prince I make him all days of his life, for the sake of David My servant whom I chose, who kept My commands and My statutes;"
11011035,11,11,35,"and I have taken the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and given it to thee -- the ten tribes;"
11011036,11,11,36,"and to his son I give one tribe, for there being a lamp to David My servant all the days before Me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen to Myself to put My name there."
11011037,11,11,37,"`And thee I take, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul desireth, and thou hast been king over Israel;"
11011038,11,11,38,"and it hath been, if thou dost hear all that I command thee, and hast walked in My ways, and done that which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commands, as did David My servant, that I have been with thee, and have built for thee a stedfast house, as I built for David, and have given to thee Israel,"
11011039,11,11,39,"and I humble the seed of David for this; only, not all the days.'"
11011040,11,11,40,"And Solomon seeketh to put Jeroboam to death, and Jeroboam riseth and fleeth to Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and he is in Egypt till the death of Solomon."
11011041,11,11,41,"And the rest of the matters of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written on the book of the matters of Solomon?"
11011042,11,11,42,"And the days that Solomon hath reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel `are' forty years,"
11011043,11,11,43,"and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David his father, and reign doth Rehoboam his son in his stead."
11012001,11,12,1,"And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for to Shechem hath all Israel come to make him king."
11012002,11,12,2,"And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's hearing (and he `is' yet in Egypt where he hath fled from the presence of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelleth in Egypt),"
11012003,11,12,3,"that they send and call for him; and they come -- Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel -- and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,"
11012004,11,12,4,"`Thy father made hard our yoke, and thou, now, make light `some' of the hard service of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.'"
11012005,11,12,5,"And he saith unto them, `Go -- yet three days, and come back unto me;' and the people go."
11012006,11,12,6,"And king Rehoboam consulteth with the elders who have been standing in the presence of Solomon his father, in his being alive, saying, `How are ye counselling to answer this people?'"
11012007,11,12,7,"And they speak unto him, saying, `If, to-day, thou art servant to this people, and hast served them, and answered them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.'"
11012008,11,12,8,"And he forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, who are standing before him;"
11012009,11,12,9,"and he saith unto them, `What are ye counselling, and we answer this people, who have spoken unto me, saying, Lighten `somewhat' of the yoke that thy father put upon us?'"
11012010,11,12,10,"And they speak unto him -- the lads who had grown up with him -- saying, `Thus dost thou say to this people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and thou, make `it' light upon us; thus dost thou speak unto them, My little `finger' is thicker than the loins of my father;"
11012011,11,12,11,"and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I -- I chastise you with scorpions.'"
11012012,11,12,12,"And they come -- Jeroboam and all the people -- unto Rehoboam, on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, `Come back unto me on the third day.'"
11012013,11,12,13,"And the king answereth the people sharply, and forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him,"
11012014,11,12,14,"and speaketh unto them, according to the counsel of the lads, saying, `My father made your yoke heavy, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I -- I chastise you with scorpions;'"
11012015,11,12,15,"and the king hearkened not unto the people, for the revolution was from Jehovah, in order to establish His word that Jehovah spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat."
11012016,11,12,16,"And all Israel see that the king hath not hearkened unto them, and the people send the king back word, saying, `What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse; to thy tents, O Israel; now see thy house, O David!' and Israel goeth to its tents."
11012017,11,12,17,"As to the sons of Israel, those dwelling in the cities of Judah -- over them reign doth Rehoboam."
11012018,11,12,18,"And king Rehoboam sendeth Adoram who `is' over the tribute, and all Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam hath strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;"
11012019,11,12,19,and Israel transgresseth against the house of David unto this day.
11012020,11,12,20,"And it cometh to pass, at all Israel's hearing that Jeroboam hath returned, that they send and call him unto the company, and cause him to reign over all Israel; none hath been after the house of David save the tribe of Judah alone."
11012021,11,12,21,"And Rehoboam cometh to Jerusalem, and assembleth all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight with the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon."
11012022,11,12,22,"And the word of God is unto Shemaiah a man of God, saying,"
11012023,11,12,23,"`Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying,"
11012024,11,12,24,"Thus said Jehovah, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren the sons of Israel; turn back each to his house, for from Me hath this thing been;' and they hear the word of Jehovah, and turn back to go according to the word of Jehovah."
11012025,11,12,25,"And Jeroboam buildeth Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelleth in it, and goeth out thence, and buildeth Penuel;"
11012026,11,12,26,"and Jeroboam saith in his heart, `Now doth the kingdom turn back to the house of David --"
11012027,11,12,27,"if this people go up to make sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, then hath the heart of this people turned back unto their lord, unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they have slain me, and turned back unto Rehoboam king of Judah.'"
11012028,11,12,28,"And the king taketh counsel, and maketh two calves of gold, and saith unto them, `Enough to you of going up to Jerusalem; lo, thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'"
11012029,11,12,29,"And he setteth the one in Beth-El, and the other he hath put in Dan,"
11012030,11,12,30,"and this thing becometh a sin, and the people go before the one -- unto Dan."
11012031,11,12,31,"And he maketh the house of high places, and maketh priests of the extremities of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi;"
11012032,11,12,32,"and Jeroboam maketh a festival in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival that `is' in Judah, and he offereth on the altar -- so did he in Beth-El -- to sacrifice to the calves which he made, and he hath appointed in Beth-El the priests of the high places that he made."
11012033,11,12,33,"And he offereth up on the altar that he made in Beth-El, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month that he devised of his own heart, and he maketh a festival to the sons of Israel, and offereth on the altar -- to make perfume."
11013001,11,13,1,"And lo, a man of God hath come from Judah, by the word of Jehovah, unto Beth-El, and Jeroboam is standing by the altar -- to make perfume;"
11013002,11,13,2,"and he calleth against the altar, by the word of Jehovah, and saith, `Altar! altar! thus said Jehovah, Lo, a son is born to the house of David -- Josiah his name -- and he hath sacrificed on thee the priests of the high places who are making perfume on thee, and bones of man are burnt on thee.'"
11013003,11,13,3,"And he hath given on that day a sign, saying, `This `is' the sign that Jehovah hath spoken, Lo, the altar is rent, and the ashes poured forth that `are' on it.'"
11013004,11,13,4,"And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the word of the man of God that he calleth against the altar in Beth-El, that Jeroboam putteth forth his hand from off the altar, saying, `Catch him;' and his hand is dried up that he hath put forth against him, and he is not able to bring it back unto him,"
11013005,11,13,5,"and the altar is rent, and the ashes poured forth from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah."
11013006,11,13,6,"And the king answereth and saith unto the man of God, `Appease, I pray thee, the face of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, and my hand doth come back unto me;' and the man of God appeaseth the face of Jehovah, and the hand of the king cometh back unto him, and it is as at the beginning."
11013007,11,13,7,"And the king speaketh unto the man of God, `Come in with me to the house, and refresh thyself, and I give to thee a gift.'"
11013008,11,13,8,"And the man of God saith unto the king, `If thou dost give to me the half of thine house, I do not go in with thee, nor do I eat bread, nor do I drink water, in this place;"
11013009,11,13,9,"for so He commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou dost not eat bread nor drink water, nor turn back in the way that thou hast come.'"
11013010,11,13,10,"And he goeth on in another way, and hath not turned back in the way in which he came in unto Beth-El."
11013011,11,13,11,"And a certain aged prophet is dwelling in Beth-El, and his son cometh and recounteth to him all the deed that the man of God hath done to-day in Beth-El, the words that he hath spoken unto the king, -- yea, they recount them to their father."
11013012,11,13,12,"And their father saith unto them, `Where `is' this -- the way he hath gone?' and his sons see the way that the man of God hath gone who came from Judah."
11013013,11,13,13,"And he saith unto his sons, `Saddle for me the ass,' and they saddle for him the ass, and he rideth on it,"
11013014,11,13,14,"and goeth after the man of God, and findeth him sitting under the oak, and saith unto him, `Art thou the man of God who hast come from Judah?' and he saith, `I `am'.'"
11013015,11,13,15,"And he saith unto him, `Come with me to the house, and eat bread.'"
11013016,11,13,16,"And he saith, `I am not able to turn back with thee, and to go in with thee, nor do I eat bread or drink with thee water in this place,"
11013017,11,13,17,"for a word `is' unto me by the word of Jehovah, Thou dost not eat bread nor drink there water, thou dost not turn back to go in the way in which thou camest.'"
11013018,11,13,18,"And he saith to him, `I also `am' a prophet like thee, and a messenger spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee unto thy house, and he doth eat bread and drink water;' -- he hath lied to him."
11013019,11,13,19,"And he turneth back with him, and eateth bread in his house, and drinketh water."
11013020,11,13,20,"And it cometh to pass -- they are sitting at the table -- and a word of Jehovah is unto the prophet who brought him back,"
11013021,11,13,21,"and he calleth unto the man of God who came from Judah, saying, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that thou hast provoked the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the command that Jehovah thy God charged thee,"
11013022,11,13,22,"and turnest back and dost eat bread and drink water in the place of which He said unto thee, Thou dost not eat bread nor drink water -- thy carcase cometh not in unto the burying-place of thy fathers.'"
11013023,11,13,23,"And it cometh to pass, after his eating bread, and after his drinking, that he saddleth for him the ass, for the prophet whom he had brought back,"
11013024,11,13,24,"and he goeth, and a lion findeth him in the way, and putteth him to death, and his carcase is cast in the way, and the ass is standing near it, and the lion is standing near the carcase."
11013025,11,13,25,"And lo, men are passing by, and see the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing near the carcase, and they come and speak `of it' in the city in which the old prophet is dwelling."
11013026,11,13,26,"And the prophet who brought him back out of the way heareth and saith, `It `is' the man of God who provoked the mouth of Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth him to the lion, and it destroyeth him, and putteth him to death, according to the word of Jehovah that he spake to him.'"
11013027,11,13,27,"And he speaketh unto his sons saying, `Saddle for me the ass,' and they saddle `it'."
11013028,11,13,28,"And he goeth and findeth his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion are standing near the carcase -- the lion hath not eaten the carcase nor destroyed the ass."
11013029,11,13,29,"And the prophet taketh up the carcase of the man of God, and placeth it on the ass, and bringeth it back, and the old prophet cometh in unto the city to mourn and to bury him,"
11013030,11,13,30,"and he placeth his carcase in his own grave, and they mourn for him, `Oh, my brother!'"
11013031,11,13,31,"And it cometh to pass, after his burying him, that he speaketh unto his sons, saying, `At my death -- ye have buried me in the burying-place in which the man of God is buried; near his bones place my bones;"
11013032,11,13,32,"for the word certainly cometh to pass that he called by the word of Jehovah concerning the altar which `is' Beth-El, and concerning all the houses of the high places that `are' in cities of Samaria.'"
11013033,11,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam hath not turned from his evil way, and turneth back, and maketh of the extremities of the people priests of high places; he who is desirous he consecrateth his hand, and he is of the priests of the high places."
11013034,11,13,34,"And in this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam, even to cut `it' off, and to destroy `it' from off the face of the ground."
11014001,11,14,1,"At that time was Abijah son of Jeroboam sick,"
11014002,11,14,2,"and Jeroboam saith to his wife, `Rise, I pray thee, and change thyself, and they know not that thou `art' wife of Jeroboam, and thou hast gone to Shiloh; lo, there `is' Ahijah the prophet; he spake unto me of `being' king over this people;"
11014003,11,14,3,"and thou hast taken in thy hand ten loaves, and crumbs, and a bottle of honey, and hast gone in unto him; he doth declare to thee what becometh of the youth.'"
11014004,11,14,4,"And the wife of Jeroboam doth so, and riseth, and goeth to Shiloh, and entereth the house of Ahijah, and Ahijah is not able to see, for his eyes have stood because of his age."
11014005,11,14,5,"And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, `Lo, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from thee concerning her son, for he is sick; thus and thus thou dost speak unto her, and it cometh to pass at her coming in, that she is making herself strange.'"
11014006,11,14,6,"And it cometh to pass, at Ahijah's hearing the sound of her feet `as' she came in to the opening, that he saith, `Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why is this -- thou art making thyself strange? and I am sent unto thee `with' a sharp thing:"
11014007,11,14,7,"Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Because that I have made thee high out of the midst of the people, and appoint thee leader over my people Israel,"
11014008,11,14,8,"and rend the kingdom from the house of David, and give it to thee, -- and thou hast not been as My servant David who kept My commands, and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do only that which `is' right in Mine eyes,"
11014009,11,14,9,"and thou dost evil above all who have been before thee, and goest, and makest to thee other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and Me thou hast cast behind thy back:"
11014010,11,14,10,"`Therefore, lo, I am bringing in evil unto the house of Jeroboam, and have cut off to Jeroboam those sitting on the wall -- shut up and left -- in Israel, and have put away the posterity of the house of Jeroboam, as one putteth away the dung till its consumption;"
11014011,11,14,11,"him who dieth of Jeroboam in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth in a field do fowl of the heavens eat, for Jehovah hath spoken."
11014012,11,14,12,"`And thou, rise, go to thy house; in the going in of thy feet to the city -- hath the lad died;"
11014013,11,14,13,"and all Israel have mourned for him, and buried him, for this one -- by himself -- cometh of Jeroboam unto a grave, because there hath been found in him a good thing towards Jehovah, God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam."
11014014,11,14,14,`And Jehovah hath raised up for Him a king over Israel who cutteth off the house of Jeroboam this day -- and what? -- even now!
11014015,11,14,15,"And Jehovah hath smitten Israel as the reed is moved by the waters, and hath plucked Israel from off this good ground that He gave to their fathers, and scattered them beyond the River, because that they made their shrines, provoking Jehovah to anger;"
11014016,11,14,16,"and He giveth up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin.'"
11014017,11,14,17,"And the wife of Jeroboam riseth, and goeth, and cometh to Tirzah; she hath come in to the threshold of the house, and the youth dieth;"
11014018,11,14,18,"and they bury him, and mourn for him do all Israel, according to the word of Jehovah, that he spake by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet."
11014019,11,14,19,"And the rest of the matters of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, lo, they are written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel."
11014020,11,14,20,"And the days that Jeroboam reigned `are' twenty and two years, and he lieth with his fathers, and reign doth Nadab his son in his stead."
11014021,11,14,21,"And Rehoboam son of Solomon hath reigned in Judah; a son of forty and one years `is' Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah chose to set His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel, and the name of his mother `is' Naamah the Ammonitess."
11014022,11,14,22,"And Judah doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and they make Him zealous above all that their fathers did by their sins that they have sinned."
11014023,11,14,23,"And they build -- also they -- for themselves high places, and standing-pillars, and shrines, on every high height, and under every green tree;"
11014024,11,14,24,and also a whoremonger hath been in the land; they have done according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel.
11014025,11,14,25,"And it cometh to pass, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, gone up hath Shishak king of Egypt against Jerusalem,"
11014026,11,14,26,"and he taketh the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king, yea, the whole he hath taken; and he taketh all the shields of gold that Solomon made."
11014027,11,14,27,"And king Rehoboam maketh in their stead shields of brass, and hath made `them' a charge on the hand of the heads of the runners, those keeping the opening of the house of the king,"
11014028,11,14,28,"and it cometh to pass, from the going in of the king to the house of Jehovah, the runners bear them, and have brought them back unto the chamber of the runners."
11014029,11,14,29,"And the rest of the matters of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11014030,11,14,30,And war hath been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days;
11014031,11,14,31,"and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers, in the city of David, and the name of his mother `is' Naamah the Ammonitess, and reign doth Abijam his son in his stead."
11015001,11,15,1,"And in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam son of Nebat, reigned hath Abijam over Judah;"
11015002,11,15,2,"three years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Maachah daughter of Abishalom;"
11015003,11,15,3,"and he walketh in all the sins of his father, that he did before him, and his heart hath not been perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father;"
11015004,11,15,4,"but for David's sake hath Jehovah his God given to him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,"
11015005,11,15,5,"in that David did that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from all that He commanded him all days of his life -- only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite;"
11015006,11,15,6,and war hath been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
11015007,11,15,7,"And the rest of the matters of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? And war hath been between Abijam and Jeroboam;"
11015008,11,15,8,"and Abijam lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Asa his son in his stead."
11015009,11,15,9,"And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned hath Asa over Judah,"
11015010,11,15,10,"and forty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Maachah daughter of Abishalom."
11015011,11,15,11,"And Asa doth that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father,"
11015012,11,15,12,"and removeth the whoremongers out of the land, and turneth aside all the idols that his fathers made;"
11015013,11,15,13,"and also Maachah his mother -- he turneth her aside from being mistress, in that she made a horrible thing for a shrine, and Asa cutteth down her horrible thing, and burneth `it' by the brook Kidron;"
11015014,11,15,14,"and the high places have not turned aside; only, the heart of Asa hath been perfect with Jehovah all his days,"
11015015,11,15,15,"and he bringeth in the sanctified things of his father, and his own sanctified things, to the house of Jehovah, silver, and gold, and vessels."
11015016,11,15,16,"And war hath been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days,"
11015017,11,15,17,"and Baasha king of Israel goeth up against Judah, and buildeth Ramah, not to permit any one going out and coming in to Asa king of Judah."
11015018,11,15,18,"And Asa taketh all the silver and the gold that are left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king, and giveth them into the hand of his servants, and king Asa sendeth them unto Ben-Hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus, saying,"
11015019,11,15,19,"`A covenant `is' between me and thee, between my father and thy father; lo, I have sent to thee a reward of silver and gold; go, break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he goeth up from off me.'"
11015020,11,15,20,"And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sendeth the heads of the forces that he hath against cities of Israel, and smiteth Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Beth-Maachah, and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali;"
11015021,11,15,21,"and it cometh to pass at Baasha's hearing, that he ceaseth from building Ramah, and dwelleth in Tirzah."
11015022,11,15,22,"And king Asa hath summoned all Judah -- there is none exempt -- and they lift up the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha hath built, and king Asa buildeth with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."
11015023,11,15,23,"And the rest of all the matters of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? Only, at the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet;"
11015024,11,15,24,"and Asa lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead."
11015025,11,15,25,"And Nadab son of Jeroboam hath reigned over Israel, in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigneth over Israel two years,"
11015026,11,15,26,"and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and goeth in the way of his father, and in his sin that he made Israel to sin."
11015027,11,15,27,"And conspire against him doth Baasha son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, and Baasha smiteth him in Gibbethon, which `is' to the Philistines -- and Nadab and all Israel are laying siege against Gibbethon --"
11015028,11,15,28,"yea, Baasha putteth him to death in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigneth in his stead."
11015029,11,15,29,"And it cometh to pass, at his reigning, he hath smitten the whole house of Jeroboam, he hath not left any breathing to Jeroboam till his destroying him, according to the word of Jehovah, that He spake by the hand of His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,"
11015030,11,15,30,"because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin, by his provocation with which he provoked to anger Jehovah, God of Israel."
11015031,11,15,31,"And the rest of the matters of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11015032,11,15,32,And war hath been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
11015033,11,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Baasha son of Ahijah over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years,"
11015034,11,15,34,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and walketh in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin."
11016001,11,16,1,"And a word of Jehovah is unto Jehu son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying,"
11016002,11,16,2,"`Because that I have raised thee up out of the dust, and appoint thee leader over My people Israel, and thou walkest in the way of Jeroboam, and causest My people Israel to sin -- to provoke Me to anger with their sins;"
11016003,11,16,3,"lo, I am putting away the posterity of Baasha, even the posterity of his house, and have given up thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat;"
11016004,11,16,4,"him who dieth of Baasha in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth of his in a field do fowl of the heavens eat.'"
11016005,11,16,5,"And the rest of the matters of Baasha, and that which he did, and his might, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11016006,11,16,6,"And Baasha lieth with his fathers, and is buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son reigneth in his stead."
11016007,11,16,7,"And also by the hand of Jehu son of Hanani the prophet a word of Jehovah hath been concerning Baasha, and concerning his house, and concerning all the evil that he did in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, to be like the house of Jeroboam, and concerning that for which he smote him."
11016008,11,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Elah son of Baasha over Israel in Tirzah, two years;"
11016009,11,16,9,"and conspire against him doth his servant Zimri (head of the half of the chariots) and he `is' in Tirzah drinking -- a drunkard in the house of Arza, who `is' over the house in Tirzah."
11016010,11,16,10,"And Zimri cometh in and smiteth him, and putteth him to death, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigneth in his stead;"
11016011,11,16,11,"and it cometh to pass in his reigning, at his sitting on his throne, he hath smitten the whole house of Baasha; he hath not left to him any sitting on the wall, and of his redeemers, and of his friends."
11016012,11,16,12,"And Zimri destroyeth the whole house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, that He spake concerning Baasha, by the hand of Jehu the prophet:"
11016013,11,16,13,"concerning all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, that they sinned, and that they caused Israel to sin to provoke Jehovah, God of Israel, with their vanities."
11016014,11,16,14,"And the rest of the matters of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11016015,11,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, reigned hath Zimri seven days in Tirzah; and the people are encamping against Gibbethon, which `is' to the Philistines;"
11016016,11,16,16,"and the people who are encamping hear, saying, `Zimri hath conspired, and also hath smitten the king;' and all Israel cause Omri head of the host to reign over Israel on that day in the camp."
11016017,11,16,17,"And Omri goeth up, and all Israel with him, from Gibbethon, and they lay siege to Tirzah."
11016018,11,16,18,"And it cometh to pass, at Zimri's seeing that the city hath been captured, that he cometh in unto a high place of the house of the king, and burneth over him the house of the king with fire, and dieth,"
11016019,11,16,19,"for his sins that he sinned, to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to walk in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he did, to cause Israel to sin;"
11016020,11,16,20,"and the rest of the matters of Zimri, and his conspiracy that he made, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11016021,11,16,21,"Then are the sons of Israel parted into halves; half of the people hath been after Tibni son of Ginath to cause him to reign, and the half after Omri;"
11016022,11,16,22,"and stronger are the people that are after Omri than the people that are after Tibni son of Ginath, and Tibni dieth, and Omri reigneth."
11016023,11,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah reigned hath Omri over Israel twelve years; in Tirzah he hath reigned six years,"
11016024,11,16,24,"and he buyeth the mount Samaria from Shemer, with two talents of silver, and buildeth `on' the mount, and calleth the name of the city that he hath built by the name of Shemer, lord of the hill -- Samaria."
11016025,11,16,25,"And Omri doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and doth evil above all who `are' before him,"
11016026,11,16,26,"and walketh in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, God of Israel, with their vanities."
11016027,11,16,27,"And the rest of the matters of Omri that he did, and his might that he got, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11016028,11,16,28,"And Omri lieth with his fathers, and is buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigneth in his stead."
11016029,11,16,29,"And Ahab son of Omri hath reigned over Israel in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab son of Omri reigneth over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years,"
11016030,11,16,30,and Ahab son of Omri doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah above all who `are' before him.
11016031,11,16,31,"And it cometh to pass -- hath it been light his walking in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat? -- then he taketh a wife, Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, and goeth and serveth Baal, and boweth himself to it,"
11016032,11,16,32,"and raiseth up an altar for Baal, in the house of the Baal, that he built in Samaria;"
11016033,11,16,33,"and Ahab maketh the shrine, and Ahab addeth to do so as to provoke Jehovah, God of Israel, above all the kings of Israel who have been before him."
11016034,11,16,34,"In his days hath Hiel the Beth-Elite built Jericho; in Abiram his first-born he laid its foundation, and in Segub his youngest he set up its doors, according to the word of Jehovah that He spake by the hand of Joshua son of Nun."
11017001,11,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, saith unto Ahab, `Jehovah, God of Israel, liveth, before whom I have stood, there is not these years dew and rain, except according to my word.'"
11017002,11,17,2,"And the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying,"
11017003,11,17,3,"`Go from this `place'; and thou hast turned for thee eastward, and been hidden by the brook Cherith, that `is' on the front of the Jordan,"
11017004,11,17,4,"and it hath been, from the brook thou dost drink, and the ravens I have commanded to sustain thee there.'"
11017005,11,17,5,"And he goeth and doth according to the word of Jehovah, yea, he goeth and dwelleth by the brook Cherith, that `is' on the front of the Jordan,"
11017006,11,17,6,"and the ravens are bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and of the brook he drinketh."
11017007,11,17,7,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of days, that the brook drieth up, for there hath been no rain in the land,"
11017008,11,17,8,"and the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying,"
11017009,11,17,9,"`Rise, go to Zarephath, that `is' to Zidon, and thou hast dwelt there; lo, I have commanded there a widow woman to sustain thee.'"
11017010,11,17,10,"And he riseth, and goeth to Zarephath, and cometh in unto the opening of the city, and lo there, a widow woman gathering sticks, and he calleth unto her, and saith, `Bring, I pray thee, to me, a little water in a vessel, and I drink.'"
11017011,11,17,11,"And she goeth to bring `it', and he calleth unto her and saith, `Bring, I pray thee, to me a morsel of bread in thy hand.'"
11017012,11,17,12,"And she saith, `Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but the fulness of the hand of meal in a pitcher, and a little oil in a dish; and lo, I am gathering two sticks, and have gone in and prepared it for myself, and for my son, and we have eaten it -- and died.'"
11017013,11,17,13,"And Elijah saith unto her, `Fear not, go, do according to thy word, only make for me thence a little cake, in the first place, and thou hast brought out to me; and for thee and for thy son make -- last;"
11017014,11,17,14,"for thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The pitcher of meal is not consumed, and the dish of oil is not lacking, till the day of Jehovah's giving a shower on the face of the ground.'"
11017015,11,17,15,"And she goeth, and doth according to the word of Elijah, and she eateth, she and he, and her household -- days;"
11017016,11,17,16,"the pitcher of meal was not consumed, and the dish of oil did not lack, according to the word of Jehovah that He spake by the hand of Elijah."
11017017,11,17,17,"And it cometh to pass, after these things, the son of the woman, mistress of the house, hath been sick, and his sickness is very severe till that no breath hath been left in him."
11017018,11,17,18,"And she saith unto Elijah, `What -- to me and to thee, O man of God? thou hast come unto me to cause mine iniquity to be remembered, and to put my son to death!'"
11017019,11,17,19,"And he saith unto her, `Give to me thy son;' and he taketh him out of her bosom, and taketh him up unto the upper chamber where he is abiding, and layeth him on his own bed,"
11017020,11,17,20,"and crieth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Jehovah my God, also on the widow with whom I am sojourning hast Thou done evil -- to put her son to death?'"
11017021,11,17,21,"And he stretcheth himself out on the lad three times, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `O Jehovah my God, let turn back, I pray Thee, the soul of this lad into his midst;'"
11017022,11,17,22,"and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the lad turneth back into his midst, and he liveth."
11017023,11,17,23,"And Elijah taketh the lad, and bringeth him down from the upper chamber of the house, and giveth him to his mother, and Elijah saith, `See, thy son liveth!'"
11017024,11,17,24,"And the woman saith unto Elijah, `Now, this I have known, that a man of God thou `art', and the word of Jehovah in thy mouth `is' truth.'"
11018001,11,18,1,"And the days are many, and the word of Jehovah hath been unto Elijah in the third year, saying, `Go, appear unto Ahab, and I give rain on the face of the ground;'"
11018002,11,18,2,"and Elijah goeth to appear unto Ahab. And the famine is severe in Samaria,"
11018003,11,18,3,"and Ahab calleth unto Obadiah, who `is' over the house -- and Obadiah hath been fearing Jehovah greatly,"
11018004,11,18,4,"and it cometh to pass, in Jezebel's cutting off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah taketh a hundred prophets, and hideth them, fifty men in a cave, and hath sustained them with bread and water --"
11018005,11,18,5,"and Ahab saith unto Obadiah, `Go through the land, unto all fountains of waters, and unto all the brooks, if so be we find hay, and keep alive horse and mule, and do not cut off any of the cattle.'"
11018006,11,18,6,"And they apportion to themselves the land, to pass over into it; Ahab hath gone in one way by himself, and Obadiah hath gone in another way by himself;"
11018007,11,18,7,"and Obadiah `is' in the way, and lo, Elijah -- to meet him; and he discerneth him, and falleth on his face, and saith, `Art thou he -- my lord Elijah?'"
11018008,11,18,8,"And he saith to him, `I `am'; go, say to thy lord, Lo, Elijah.'"
11018009,11,18,9,"And he saith, `What have I sinned, that thou art giving thy servant into the hand of Ahab -- to put me to death?"
11018010,11,18,10,"Jehovah thy God liveth, if there is a nation and kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and they said, He is not, then he caused the kingdom and the nation to swear, that it doth not find thee;"
11018011,11,18,11,"and now, thou art saying, Go, say to thy lord, Lo, Elijah;"
11018012,11,18,12,"and it hath been, I go from thee, and the Spirit of Jehovah doth lift thee up, whither I know not, and I have come to declare to Ahab, and he doth not find thee, and he hath slain me; and thy servant is fearing Jehovah from my youth."
11018013,11,18,13,"`Hath it not been declared to my lord that which I have done in Jezebel's slaying the prophets of Jehovah, that I hide of the prophets of Jehovah a hundred men, fifty by fifty in a cave, and sustained them with bread and water?"
11018014,11,18,14,"and now thou art saying, Go, say to my lord, Lo, Elijah -- and he hath slain me!'"
11018015,11,18,15,"And Elijah saith, `Jehovah of Hosts liveth, before whom I have stood, surely to-day I appear unto him.'"
11018016,11,18,16,"And Obadiah goeth to meet Ahab, and declareth `it' to him, and Ahab goeth to meet Elijah,"
11018017,11,18,17,"and it cometh to pass at Ahab's seeing Elijah, that Ahab saith unto him, `Art thou he -- the troubler of Israel?'"
11018018,11,18,18,"And he saith, `I have not troubled Israel, but thou and the house of thy father, in your forsaking the commands of Jehovah, and thou goest after the Baalim;"
11018019,11,18,19,"and now, send, gather unto me all Israel, unto the mount of Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the shrine, four hundred -- eating at the table of Jezebel.'"
11018020,11,18,20,"And Ahab sendeth among all the sons of Israel, and gathereth the prophets unto the mount of Carmel;"
11018021,11,18,21,"and Elijah cometh nigh unto all the people, and saith, `Till when are ye leaping on the two branches? -- if Jehovah `is' God, go after Him; and if Baal, go after him;' and the people have not answered him a word."
11018022,11,18,22,"And Elijah saith unto the people, `I -- I have been left a prophet of Jehovah -- by myself; and the prophets of Baal `are' four hundred and fifty men;"
11018023,11,18,23,"and let them give to us two bullocks, and they choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces, and place `it' on the wood, and place no fire; and I -- I prepare the other bullock, and have put `it' on the wood, and fire I do not place; --"
11018024,11,18,24,"and ye have called in the name of your god, and I -- I call in the name of Jehovah, and it hath been, the god who answereth by fire -- He `is' the God.' And all the people answer and say, `Good `is' the word.'"
11018025,11,18,25,"And Elijah saith to the prophets of Baal, `Choose for you the one bullock, and prepare first, for ye `are' the multitude, and call ye in the name of your god, and place no fire.'"
11018026,11,18,26,"And they take the bullock that `one' gave to them, and prepare, and call in the name of Baal from the morning even till the noon, saying, `O Baal, answer us!' and there is no voice, and there is none answering; and they leap on the altar that one had made."
11018027,11,18,27,"And it cometh to pass, at noon, that Elijah playeth on them, and saith, `Call with a loud voice, for he `is' a god, for he is meditating, or pursuing, or on a journey; it may be he is asleep, an doth awake.'"
11018028,11,18,28,"And they call with a loud voice, and cut themselves, according to their ordinance, with swords and with spears, till a flowing of blood `is' on them;"
11018029,11,18,29,"and it cometh to pass, at the passing by of the noon, that they feign themselves prophets till the going up of the present, and there is no voice, and there is none answering, and there is none attending."
11018030,11,18,30,"And Elijah saith to all the people, `Come nigh unto me;' and all the people come nigh unto him, and he repaireth the altar of Jehovah that is broken down;"
11018031,11,18,31,"and Elijah taketh twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah was, saying, `Israel is thy name;'"
11018032,11,18,32,"and he buildeth with the stones an altar, in the name of Jehovah, and maketh a trench, as about the space of two measures of seed, round about the altar."
11018033,11,18,33,"And he arrangeth the wood, and cutteth in pieces the bullock, and placeth `it' on the wood, and saith, `Fill ye four pitchers of water, and pour on the burnt-offering, and on the wood;"
11018034,11,18,34,"and he saith, `Do `it' a second time;' and they do `it' a second time; and he saith, `Do `it' a third time;' and they do `it' a third time;"
11018035,11,18,35,"and the water goeth round about the altar, and also, the trench he hath filled with water."
11018036,11,18,36,"And it cometh to pass, at the going up of the `evening-'present, that Elijah the prophet cometh nigh and saith, `Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to-day let it be known that Thou `art' God in Israel, and I Thy servant, that by Thy word I have done the whole of these things;"
11018037,11,18,37,"answer me, O Jehovah, answer me, and this people doth know that Thou `art' Jehovah God; and Thou hast turned their heart backward.'"
11018038,11,18,38,"And there falleth a fire of Jehovah, and consumeth the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and the water that `is' in the trench it hath licked up."
11018039,11,18,39,"And all the people see, and fall on their faces, and say, `Jehovah, He `is' the God, Jehovah, He `is' the God.'"
11018040,11,18,40,"And Elijah saith to them, `Catch ye the prophets of Baal; let not a man escape of them;' and they catch them, and Elijah bringeth them down unto the stream Kishon, and doth slaughter them there."
11018041,11,18,41,"And Elijah saith to Ahab, `Go up, eat and drink, because of the sound of the noise of the shower.'"
11018042,11,18,42,"And Ahab goeth up to eat, and to drink, and Elijah hath gone up unto the top of Carmel, and he stretcheth himself out on the earth, and he placeth his face between his knees,"
11018043,11,18,43,"and saith unto his young man, `Go up, I pray thee, look attentively the way of the sea;' and he goeth up and looketh attentively, and saith, `There is nothing;' and he saith, `Turn back,' seven times."
11018044,11,18,44,"And it cometh to pass, at the seventh, that he saith, `Lo, a little thickness as the palm of a man is coming up out of the sea.' And he saith, `Go up, say unto Ahab, `Bind -- and go down, and the shower doth not restrain thee.'"
11018045,11,18,45,"And it cometh to pass, in the meantime, that the heavens have become black -- thick clouds and wind -- and the shower is great; and Ahab rideth, and goeth to Jezreel,"
11018046,11,18,46,"and the hand of Jehovah hath been on Elijah, and he girdeth up his loins, and runneth before Ahab, till thine entering Jezreel."
11019001,11,19,1,"And Ahab declareth to Jezebel all that Elijah did, and all how he slew all the prophets by the sword,"
11019002,11,19,2,"and Jezebel sendeth a messenger unto Elijah, saying, `Thus doth the gods, and thus do they add, surely about this time to-morrow, I make thy life as the life of one of them.'"
11019003,11,19,3,"And he feareth, and riseth, and goeth for his life, and cometh in to Beer-Sheba, that `is' Judah's, and leaveth his young man there,"
11019004,11,19,4,"and he himself hath gone into the wilderness a day's Journey, and cometh and sitteth under a certain retem-tree, and desireth his soul to die, and saith, `Enough, now, O Jehovah, take my soul, for I `am' not better than my fathers.'"
11019005,11,19,5,"And he lieth down and sleepeth under a certain retem-tree, and lo, a messenger cometh against him, and saith to him, `Rise, eat;'"
11019006,11,19,6,"and he looketh attentively, and lo, at his bolster a cake `baken on' burning stones, and a dish of water, and he eateth, and drinketh, and turneth, and lieth down."
11019007,11,19,7,"And the messenger of Jehovah turneth back a second time, and cometh against him, and saith, `Rise, eat, for the way is too great for thee;'"
11019008,11,19,8,"and he riseth, and eateth, and drinketh, and goeth in the power of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God -- Horeb."
11019009,11,19,9,"And he cometh in there, unto the cave, and lodgeth there, and lo, the word of Jehovah `is' unto him, and saith to him, `What -- to thee, here, Elijah?'"
11019010,11,19,10,"And he saith, `I have been very zealous for Jehovah, God of Hosts, for the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant -- Thine altars they have thrown down, and Thy prophets they have slain by the sword, and I am left, I, by myself, and they seek my life -- to take it.'"
11019011,11,19,11,"And He saith, `Go out, and thou hast stood in the mount before Jehovah.' And lo, Jehovah is passing by, and a wind -- great and strong -- is rending mountains, and shivering rocks before Jehovah: -- not in the wind `is' Jehovah; and after the wind a shaking: -- not in the shaking `is' Jehovah;"
11019012,11,19,12,and after the shaking a fire: -- not in the fire `is' Jehovah; and after the fire a voice still small;
11019013,11,19,13,"and it cometh to pass, at Elijah's hearing `it', that he wrappeth his face in his robe, and goeth out, and standeth at the opening of the cave, and lo, unto him `is' a voice, and it saith, `What -- to thee, here, Elijah?'"
11019014,11,19,14,"And he saith, `I have been very zealous for Jehovah, God of Hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, Thine altars they have thrown down, and Thy prophets they have slain by the sword, and I am left, I, by myself, and they seek my life -- to take it.'"
11019015,11,19,15,"And Jehovah saith unto him, `Go turn back on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus, and thou hast gone in, and anointed Hazael for king over Aram,"
11019016,11,19,16,"and Jehu son of Nimshi thou dost anoint for king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat, of Abel-Meholah, thou dost anoint for prophet in thy stead."
11019017,11,19,17,"`And it hath been, him who is escaped from the sword of Hazael, put to death doth Jehu, and him who is escaped from the sword of Jehu put to death doth Elisha;"
11019018,11,19,18,"and I have left in Israel seven thousand, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him.'"
11019019,11,19,19,"And he goeth thence, and findeth Elisha son of Shaphat, and he is plowing; twelve yoke `are' before him, and he `is' with the twelfth; and Elijah passeth over unto him, and casteth his robe upon him,"
11019020,11,19,20,"and he forsaketh the oxen, and runneth after Elijah, and saith, `Let me give a kiss, I pray thee, to my father and to my mother, and I go after thee.' And he saith to him, `Go, turn back, for what have I done to thee?'"
11019021,11,19,21,"And he turneth back from after him, and taketh the yoke of oxen, and sacrificeth it, and with instruments of the oxen he hath boiled their flesh, and giveth to the people, and they eat, and he riseth, and goeth after Elijah, and serveth him."
11020001,11,20,1,"And Ben-Hadad king of Aram hath gathered all his force, and thirty and two kings `are' with him, and horse and chariot, and he goeth up and layeth siege against Samaria, and fighteth with it,"
11020002,11,20,2,"and sendeth messengers unto Ahab king of Israel, to the city,"
11020003,11,20,3,"and saith to him, `Thus said Ben-Hadad, `Thy silver and thy gold are mine, and thy wives and thy sons -- the best -- are mine.'"
11020004,11,20,4,"And the king of Israel answereth and saith, `According to thy word, my lord, O king: I `am' thine, and all that I have.'"
11020005,11,20,5,"And the messengers turn back and say, `Thus spake Ben-Hadad, saying, Surely I sent unto thee, saying, Thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy sons, to me thou dost give;"
11020006,11,20,6,"for if, at this time to-morrow, I send my servants unto thee then they have searched thy house, and the houses of thy servants, and it hath been, every desirable thing of thine eyes they place in their hand, and have taken away.'"
11020007,11,20,7,"And the king of Israel calleth to all the elders of the land, and saith, `Know, I pray you, and see that evil this `one' is seeking, for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I withheld not from him.'"
11020008,11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people say unto him, `Do not hearken, nor consent.'"
11020009,11,20,9,"And he saith to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, `Say to my lord the king, All that thou didst send for unto thy servant at the first I do, and this thing I am not able to do;' and the messengers go and take him back word."
11020010,11,20,10,"And Ben-Hadad sendeth unto him, and saith, `Thus do the gods to me, and thus do they add, if the dust of Samaria suffice for handfuls for all the people who `are' at my feet.'"
11020011,11,20,11,"And the king of Israel answereth and saith, `Speak ye: let not him who is girding on boast himself as him who is loosing `his armour'.'"
11020012,11,20,12,"And it cometh to pass at the hearing of this word -- and he is drinking, he and the kings, in the booths -- that he saith unto his servants, `Set yourselves;' and they set themselves against the city."
11020013,11,20,13,"And lo, a certain prophet hath come nigh unto Ahab king of Israel, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, `Hast thou seen all this great multitude? lo, I am giving it into thy hand to-day, and thou hast known that I `am' Jehovah.'"
11020014,11,20,14,"And Ahab saith, `By whom?' and he saith, `Thus said Jehovah, By the young men of the heads of the provinces;' and he saith, `Who doth direct the battle?' and he saith, `Thou.'"
11020015,11,20,15,"And he inspecteth the young men of the heads of the provinces, and they are two hundred, two and thirty, and after them he hath inspecteth the whole of the people, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand,"
11020016,11,20,16,"and they go out at noon, and Ben-Hadad is drinking -- drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings, helping him."
11020017,11,20,17,"And the young men of the heads of the provinces go out at the first, and Ben-Hadad sendeth, and they declare to him, saying, `Men have come out of Samaria.'"
11020018,11,20,18,"And he saith, `If for peace they have come out -- catch them alive; and if for battle they have come out -- alive catch them.'"
11020019,11,20,19,"And these have gone out of the city -- the young men of the heads of the provinces -- and the force that `is' after them,"
11020020,11,20,20,"and smite each his man, and Aram fleeth, and Israel pursueth them, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram escapeth on a horse, and the horsemen;"
11020021,11,20,21,"and the king of Israel goeth out, and smiteth the horses, and the charioteers, and hath smitten among the Aramaeans a great smiting."
11020022,11,20,22,"And the prophet cometh nigh unto the king of Israel, and saith to him, `Go, strengthen thyself, and know and see that which thou dost, for at the turn of the year the king of Aram is coming up against thee.'"
11020023,11,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him, `Gods of hills `are' their gods, therefore they were stronger than we; and yet, we fight with them in the plain -- are we not stronger than they?"
11020024,11,20,24,"`And this thing do thou: turn aside the kings each out of his place, and set captains in their stead;"
11020025,11,20,25,"and thou, number to thee a force as the force that is fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariot for chariot, and we fight with them in the plain; are we not stronger than they?' and he hearkeneth to their voice, and doth so."
11020026,11,20,26,"And it cometh to pass at the turn of the year, that Ben-Hadad inspecteth the Aramaeans, and goeth up to Aphek, to battle with Israel,"
11020027,11,20,27,"and the sons of Israel have been inspected, and supported, and go to meet them, and the sons of Israel encamp before them, like two flocks of goats, and the Aramaeans have filled the land."
11020028,11,20,28,"And there cometh nigh a man of God, and speaketh unto the king of Israel, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that the Aramaeans have said, God of hills `is' Jehovah, and He `is' not God of valleys -- I have given the whole of this great multitude into thy hand, and ye have known that I `am' Jehovah.'"
11020029,11,20,29,"And they encamp one over-against another seven days, and it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the battle draweth near, and the sons of Israel smite Aram -- a hundred thousand footmen in one day."
11020030,11,20,30,"And those left flee to Aphek, unto the city, and the wall falleth on twenty and seven chief men who are left, and Ben-Hadad hath fled, and cometh in unto the city, into the innermost part."
11020031,11,20,31,"And his servants say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel -- that they are kind kings; let us put, we pray thee, sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and we go out unto the king of Israel; it may be he doth keep thee alive.'"
11020032,11,20,32,"And they gird sackcloth on their loins, and ropes `are' on their heads, and they come in unto the king of Israel, and say, `Thy servant Ben-Hadad hath said, Let me live, I pray thee;' and he saith, `Is he yet alive? he `is' my brother.'"
11020033,11,20,33,"And the men observe diligently, and hasten, and catch it from him, and say, `Thy brother Ben-Hadad;' and he saith, `Go ye in, bring him;' and Ben-Hadad cometh out unto him, and he causeth him to come up on the chariot."
11020034,11,20,34,"And he saith unto him, `The cities that my father took from thy father, I give back, and streets thou dost make for thee in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria;' -- `and I, with a covenant, send thee away;' and he maketh with him a covenant, and sendeth him away."
11020035,11,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour by the word of Jehovah, `Smite me, I pray thee;' and the man refuseth to smite him,"
11020036,11,20,36,"and he saith to him, `Because that thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, lo, thou art going from me, and the lion hath smitten thee;' and he goeth from him, and the lion findeth him, and smiteth him."
11020037,11,20,37,"And he findeth another man, and saith, `Smite me, I pray thee;' and the man smiteth him, smiting and wounding,"
11020038,11,20,38,"and the prophet goeth and standeth for the king on the way, and disguiseth himself with ashes on his eyes."
11020039,11,20,39,"And it cometh to pass -- the king is passing by -- that he hath cried unto the king, and saith, `Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle, and lo, a man hath turned aside and bringeth in unto me a man, and saith, Keep this man; if he be at all missing, then hath thy life been for his life, or a talent of silver thou dost weigh out;"
11020040,11,20,40,"and it cometh to pass, thy servant is working hither and thither, and he is not!' and the king of Israel saith unto him, Right `is' thy judgment; thou hast determined `it'.'"
11020041,11,20,41,"And he hasteth and turneth aside the ashes from off his eyes, and the king of Israel discerneth him, that he `is' of the prophets,"
11020042,11,20,42,"and he saith unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Because thou hast sent away the man I devoted, out of `thy' hand, even thy life hath been for his life, and thy people for his people;'"
11020043,11,20,43,"and the king of Israel goeth unto his house, sulky and wroth, and cometh in to Samaria."
11021001,11,21,1,"And it cometh to pass, after these things, a vineyard hath been to Naboth the Jezreelite, that `is' in Jezreel, near the palace of Ahab king of Samaria,"
11021002,11,21,2,"and Ahab speaketh unto Naboth, saying, `Give to me thy vineyard, and it is to me for a garden of green herbs, for it `is' near by my house, and I give to thee in its stead a better vineyard than it; if good in thine eyes, I give to thee silver -- its price.'"
11021003,11,21,3,"And Naboth saith unto Ahab, `Far be it from me, by Jehovah, my giving the inheritance of my fathers to thee;'"
11021004,11,21,4,"and Ahab cometh in unto his house, sulky and wroth, because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite hath spoken unto him when he saith, `I do not give to thee the inheritance of my fathers,' and he lieth down on his bed, and turneth round his face, and hath not eaten bread."
11021005,11,21,5,"And Jezebel his wife cometh in unto him, and speaketh unto him, `What `is' this? -- thy spirit sulky, and thou art not eating bread!'"
11021006,11,21,6,"And he saith unto her, `Because I speak unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and say to him, Give to me thy vineyard for money, or if thou desire, I give to thee a vineyard in its stead; and he saith, I do not give to thee my vineyard.'"
11021007,11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife saith unto him, `Thou now dost execute rule over Israel! rise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad, -- I do give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'"
11021008,11,21,8,"And she writeth letters in the name of Ahab, and sealeth with his seal, and sendeth the letters unto the elders, and unto the freemen, who are in his city, those dwelling with Naboth,"
11021009,11,21,9,"and she writeth in the letters, saying, `Proclaim a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people,"
11021010,11,21,10,"and cause two men -- sons of worthlessness -- to sit over-against him, and they testify of him, saying, Thou hast blessed God and Melech; and they have brought him out, and stoned him, and he dieth.'"
11021011,11,21,11,"And the men of his city, the elders and the freemen who are dwelling in his city, do as Jezebel hath sent unto them, as written in the letters that she sent unto them,"
11021012,11,21,12,"they have proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people,"
11021013,11,21,13,"and two men -- sons of worthlessness -- come in, and sit over-against him, and the men of worthlessness testify of him, even Naboth, before the people, saying, `Naboth blessed God and Melech;' and they take him out to the outside of the city, and stone him with stones, and he dieth;"
11021014,11,21,14,"and they send unto Jezebel, saying, `Naboth was stoned, and is dead.'"
11021015,11,21,15,"And it cometh to pass, at Jezebel's hearing that Naboth hath been stoned, and is dead, that Jezebel saith unto Ahab, `Rise, possess the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, that he refused to give to thee for money, for Naboth is not alive but dead.'"
11021016,11,21,16,"And it cometh to pass, at Ahab's hearing that Naboth is dead, that Ahab riseth to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to possess it."
11021017,11,21,17,"And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11021018,11,21,18,"`Rise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who `is' in Samaria, -- lo, in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he hath gone down to possess it,"
11021019,11,21,19,"and thou hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Hast thou murdered, and also possessed? and thou hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Jehovah, In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, do the dogs lick thy blood, even thine.'"
11021020,11,21,20,"And Ahab saith unto Elijah, `Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?' and he saith, `I have found -- because of thy selling thyself to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah;"
11021021,11,21,21,"lo, I am bringing in unto thee evil, and have taken away thy posterity, and cut off to Ahab those sitting on the wall, and restrained, and left, in Israel,"
11021022,11,21,22,"and given up thy house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked `Me', and dost cause Israel to sin."
11021023,11,21,23,"`And also of Jezebel hath Jehovah spoken, saying, The dogs do eat Jezebel in the bulwark of Jezreel;"
11021024,11,21,24,"him who dieth of Ahab in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth in a field do fowl of the heavens eat;"
11021025,11,21,25,"surely there hath none been like Ahab, who sold himself to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife hath moved,"
11021026,11,21,26,"and he doth very abominably to go after the idols, according to all that the Amorite did whom Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel.'"
11021027,11,21,27,"And it cometh to pass, at Ahab's hearing these words, that he rendeth his garments, and putteth sackcloth on his flesh, and fasteth, and lieth in sackcloth, and goeth gently."
11021028,11,21,28,"And the word of Jehovah is unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11021029,11,21,29,"`Hast thou seen that Ahab hath been humbled before Me? because that he hath been humbled before Me, I bring not in the evil in his days; in the days of his son I bring in the evil on his house.'"
11022001,11,22,1,"And they sit still three years, there is no war between Aram and Israel,"
11022002,11,22,2,"and it cometh to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat king of Judah cometh down unto the king of Israel,"
11022003,11,22,3,"and the king of Israel saith unto his servants, `Have ye not known that ours `is' Ramoth-Gilead? and we are keeping silent from taking it out of the hand of the king of Aram!'"
11022004,11,22,4,"And he saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Dost thou go with me to battle `to' Ramoth-Gilead?' and Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, `As I am, so thou; as my people, so thy people; as my horses, so thy horses.'"
11022005,11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, `Seek, I pray thee, to-day, the word of Jehovah;'"
11022006,11,22,6,"and the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, about four hundred men, and saith unto them, `Do I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' and they say, `Go up, and the Lord doth give `it' into the hand of the king.'"
11022007,11,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, and we seek by him?'"
11022008,11,22,8,"And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Yet -- one man to seek Jehovah by him, and I have hated him, for he doth not prophesy concerning me good, but evil -- Micaiah son of Imlah;' and Jehoshaphat saith, `Let not the king say so.'"
11022009,11,22,9,"And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain eunuch, and saith, `Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.'"
11022010,11,22,10,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, in a threshing-floor, at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets are prophesying before them."
11022011,11,22,11,"And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of iron, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, By these thou dost push the Aramaeans till they are consumed;'"
11022012,11,22,12,"and all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, `Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper, and Jehovah hath given `it' into the hand of the king.'"
11022013,11,22,13,"And the messenger who hath gone to call Micaiah hath spoken unto him, saying, `Lo, I pray thee, the words of the prophets, with one mouth, `are' good towards the king; let it be, I pray thee, thy word as the word of one of them -- and thou hast spoken good.'"
11022014,11,22,14,"And Micaiah saith, `Jehovah liveth; surely that which Jehovah saith unto me -- it I speak.'"
11022015,11,22,15,"And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto him, `Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead, to battle, or do we forbear?' and he saith unto him, `Go up, and prosper, and Jehovah hath given `it' into the hand of the king.'"
11022016,11,22,16,"And the king saith unto him, `How many times am I adjuring thee that thou speak nothing unto me but truth in the name of Jehovah?'"
11022017,11,22,17,"And he saith, `I have seen all Israel scattered on the hills as sheep that have no shepherd, and Jehovah saith, These have no master; they turn back each to his house in peace.'"
11022018,11,22,18,"And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Have I not said unto thee, He doth not prophesy of me good, but evil?'"
11022019,11,22,19,"And he saith, `Therefore, hear a word of Jehovah; I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing by Him, on His right and on His left;"
11022020,11,22,20,"and Jehovah saith, Who doth entice Ahab, and he doth go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this one saith thus, and that one is saying thus."
11022021,11,22,21,"`And the spirit goeth out, and standeth before Jehovah, and saith, I -- I do entice him; and Jehovah saith unto him, By what?"
11022022,11,22,22,"and he saith, I go out, and have been a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets; and He saith, Thou dost entice, and also thou art able; go out and do so."
11022023,11,22,23,"And now, lo, Jehovah hath put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah hath spoken concerning thee -- evil.'"
11022024,11,22,24,"And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah draweth nigh, and smiteth Micaiah on the cheek, and saith, `Where `is' this -- he hath passed over -- the Spirit of Jehovah -- from me to speak with thee?'"
11022025,11,22,25,"And Micaiah saith, `Lo, thou art seeing on that day, when thou goest in to the innermost chamber to be hidden.'"
11022026,11,22,26,"And the king of Israel saith, `Take Micaiah, and turn him back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the king,"
11022027,11,22,27,"and thou hast said, Thus said the king, Place ye this one in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of oppression, and water of oppression, till my coming in peace.'"
11022028,11,22,28,"And Micaiah saith, `If thou at all return in peace -- Jehovah hath not spoken by me;' and he saith, `Hear, O peoples, all of them.'"
11022029,11,22,29,"And the king of Israel goeth up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead."
11022030,11,22,30,"And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself, and to go into battle, `And thou, put on thy garments.' And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and goeth into battle."
11022031,11,22,31,"And the king of Aram commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he hath -- thirty and two -- saying, `Ye do not fight with small or with great, but with the king of Israel by himself.'"
11022032,11,22,32,"And it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat, that they said, `He `is' only the king of Israel;' and they turn aside to him to fight, and Jehoshaphat crieth out,"
11022033,11,22,33,"and it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing that he `is' not the king of Israel, that they turn back from after him."
11022034,11,22,34,"And a man hath drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of mail, and he saith to his charioteer, `Turn thy hand, and take me out from the camp, for I have become sick.'"
11022035,11,22,35,"And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king hath been caused to stand in the chariot, over-against Aram, and he dieth in the evening, and the blood of the wound runneth out unto the midst of the chariot,"
11022036,11,22,36,"and he causeth the cry to pass over through the camp, at the going in of the sun, saying, `Each unto his city, and each unto his land.'"
11022037,11,22,37,"And the king dieth, and cometh into Samaria, and they bury the king in Samaria;"
11022038,11,22,38,"and `one' rinseth the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs lick his blood -- when the armour they had washed -- according to the word of Jehovah that He spake."
11022039,11,22,39,"And the rest of the matters of Ahab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11022040,11,22,40,"And Ahab lieth with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigneth in his stead."
11022041,11,22,41,"And Jehoshaphat son of Asa hath reigned over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel,"
11022042,11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat `is' a son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Azubah daughter of Shilhi."
11022043,11,22,43,"And he walketh in all the way of Asa his father, he hath not turned aside from it, to do that which `is' right in the eyes of Jehovah; only the high places have not turned aside, yet are the people sacrificing and making perfume in high places."
11022044,11,22,44,And Jehoshaphat maketh peace with the king of Israel;
11022045,11,22,45,"and the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he got, and with which he fought, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11022046,11,22,46,And the remnant of the whoremongers who were left in the days of Asa his father he took away out of the land;
11022047,11,22,47,and there is no king in Edom; he set up a king.
11022048,11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships at Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, and they went not, for the ships were broken in Ezion-Geber."
11022049,11,22,49,"Then said Ahaziah son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, `Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships;' and Jehoshaphat was not willing."
11022050,11,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoram his son reigneth in his stead."
11022051,11,22,51,"Ahaziah son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigneth over Israel two years,"
11022052,11,22,52,"and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and walketh in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin,"
11022053,11,22,53,"and serveth the Baal, and boweth himself to it, and provoketh Jehovah, God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
12001001,12,1,1,"And Moab transgresseth against Israel after the death of Ahab,"
12001002,12,1,2,"and Ahaziah falleth through the lattice in his upper chamber that `is' in Samaria, and is sick, and sendeth messengers, and saith unto them, `Go ye, inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if I recover from this sickness.'"
12001003,12,1,3,"And a messenger of Jehovah hath spoken unto Elijah the Tishbite, `Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and speak unto them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel -- ye are going to inquire of Baal Zebub god of Ekron?"
12001004,12,1,4,"and therefore, thus said Jehovah, The bed whither thou hast gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost certainly die;' and Elijah goeth on."
12001005,12,1,5,"And the messengers turn back unto him, and he saith unto them, `What `is' this -- ye have turned back!'"
12001006,12,1,6,"And they say unto him, `A man hath come up to meet us, and saith unto us, Go, turn back unto the king who sent you, and ye have said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, Is it because there is not a God in Israel -- thou art sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? therefore, the bed whither thou hast gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost certainly die.'"
12001007,12,1,7,"And he saith unto them, `What `is' the fashion of the man who hath come up to meet you, and speaketh unto you these words?'"
12001008,12,1,8,"And they say unto him, `A man -- hairy, and a girdle of skin girt about his loins;' and he saith, `He `is' Elijah the Tishbite.'"
12001009,12,1,9,"And he sendeth unto him a head of fifty and his fifty, and he goeth up unto him (and lo, he is sitting on the top of the hill), and he speaketh unto him, `O man of God, the king hath spoken, Come down.'"
12001010,12,1,10,"And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto the head of the fifty, `And if I `am' a man of God, fire doth come down from the heavens, and consume thee and thy fifty;' and fire cometh down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty."
12001011,12,1,11,"And he turneth and sendeth unto him another head of fifty and his fifty, and he answereth and speaketh unto him, `O man of God, thus said the king, Haste, come down.'"
12001012,12,1,12,"And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto them, `If I `am' a man of God, fire doth come down from the heavens, and consume thee and thy fifty;' and fire of God cometh down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty."
12001013,12,1,13,"And he turneth and sendeth a third head of fifty and his fifty, and the third head of fifty goeth up, and cometh in, and boweth on his knees over-against Elijah, and maketh supplication unto him, and speaketh unto him, `O man of God, let be precious, I pray thee, my soul and the soul of thy servants -- these fifty -- in thine eyes."
12001014,12,1,14,"Lo, come down hath fire from the heavens, and consumeth the two heads of the former fifties and their fifties; and, now, let my soul be precious in thine eyes.'"
12001015,12,1,15,"And a messenger of Jehovah speaketh unto Elijah, `Go down with him, be not afraid of him;' and he riseth and goeth down with him unto the king,"
12001016,12,1,16,"and speaketh unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron -- is it because there is not a God in Israel to inquire of His word? therefore, the bed whither thou hast gone up -- thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost certainly die.'"
12001017,12,1,17,"And he dieth, according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah spake, and Jehoram reigneth in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, for he had no son."
12001018,12,1,18,"And the rest of the matters of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12002001,12,2,1,"And it cometh to pass, at Jehovah's taking up Elijah in a whirlwind to the heavens, that Elijah goeth, and Elisha, from Gilgal,"
12002002,12,2,2,"and Elijah saith unto Elisha, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for Jehovah hath sent me unto Beth-El;' and Elisha saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go down to Beth-El."
12002003,12,2,3,"And sons of the prophets who `are' in Beth-El come out unto Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have known -- keep silent.'"
12002004,12,2,4,"And Elijah saith to him, `Elisha, abide, I pray thee, here, for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho;' and he saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they come in to Jericho."
12002005,12,2,5,"And sons of the prophets who `are' in Jericho come nigh unto Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have known -- keep silent.'"
12002006,12,2,6,"And Elijah saith to him, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan;' and he saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go on both of them,"
12002007,12,2,7,#NAME?
12002008,12,2,8,"And Elijah taketh his robe, and wrappeth `it' together, and smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither, and they pass over both of them on dry land."
12002009,12,2,9,"And it cometh to pass, at their passing over, that Elijah hath said unto Elisha, `Ask, what do I do for thee before I am taken from thee?' and Elisha saith, `Then let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit unto me;'"
12002010,12,2,10,"and he saith, `Thou hast asked a hard thing; if thou dost see me taken from thee, it is to thee so; and if not, it is not.'"
12002011,12,2,11,"And it cometh to pass, they are going, going on and speaking, and lo, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and they separate between them both, and Elijah goeth up in a whirlwind, to the heavens."
12002012,12,2,12,"And Elisha is seeing, and he is crying, `My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen;' and he hath not seen him again; and he taketh hold on his garments, and rendeth them into two pieces."
12002013,12,2,13,"And he taketh up the robe of Elijah, that fell from off him, and turneth back and standeth on the edge of the Jordan,"
12002014,12,2,14,"and he taketh the robe of Elijah that fell from off him, and smiteth the waters, and saith, `Where `is' Jehovah, God of Elijah -- even He?' and he smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither, and Elisha passeth over."
12002015,12,2,15,"And they see him -- the sons of the prophets who `are' in Jericho -- over-against, and they say, `Rested hath the spirit of Elijah on Elisha;' and they come to meet him, and bow themselves to him to the earth,"
12002016,12,2,16,"and say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, there are with thy servants fifty men, sons of valour: let them go, we pray thee, and they seek thy lord, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and doth cast him on one of the hills, or into one of the valleys;' and he saith, `Ye do not send.'"
12002017,12,2,17,"And they press upon him, till he is ashamed, and he saith, `Send ye;' and they send fifty men, and they seek three days, and have not found him;"
12002018,12,2,18,"and they turn back unto him -- and he is abiding in Jericho -- and he saith unto them, `Did I not say unto you, Do not go?'"
12002019,12,2,19,"And the men of the city say unto Elisha, `Lo, we pray thee, the site of the city `is' good, as my lord seeth, and the waters `are' bad, and the earth sterile.'"
12002020,12,2,20,"And he saith, `Bring to me a new dish, and place there salt;' and they bring `it' unto him,"
12002021,12,2,21,"and he goeth out unto the source of the waters, and casteth there salt, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, I have given healing to these waters; there is not thence any more death and sterility.'"
12002022,12,2,22,"And the waters are healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha, that he spake."
12002023,12,2,23,"And he goeth up thence to Beth-El, and he is going up in the way, and little youths have come out from the city, and scoff at him, and say to him, `Go up, bald-head! go up, bald-head!'"
12002024,12,2,24,"And he looketh behind him, and seeth them, and declareth them vile in the name of Jehovah, and two bears come out of the forest, and rend of them forty and two lads."
12002025,12,2,25,"And he goeth thence unto the hill of Carmel, and thence he hath turned back to Samaria."
12003001,12,3,1,"And Jehoram son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigneth twelve years,"
12003002,12,3,2,"and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, only not like his father, and like his mother, and he turneth aside the standing-pillar of Baal that his father made;"
12003003,12,3,3,"only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused Israel to sin he hath cleaved, he hath not turned aside from it."
12003004,12,3,4,"And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, `with' wool,"
12003005,12,3,5,"and it cometh to pass at the death of Ahab, that the king of Moab transgresseth against the king of Israel."
12003006,12,3,6,"And king Jehoram goeth out in that day from Samaria, and inspecteth all Israel,"
12003007,12,3,7,"and goeth and sendeth unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, `The king of Moab hath transgressed against me; dost thou go with me unto Moab for battle?' and he saith, `I go up, as I, so thou; as my people, so thy people; as my horses, so thy horses."
12003008,12,3,8,"And he saith, `Where `is' this -- the way we go up?' and he saith, `The way of the wilderness of Edom.'"
12003009,12,3,9,"And the king of Israel goeth, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and they turn round the way seven days, and there hath been no water for the camp, and for the cattle that `are' at their feet,"
12003010,12,3,10,"and the king of Israel saith, `Alas, for Jehovah hath called for these three kings, to give them into the hand of Moab.'"
12003011,12,3,11,"And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, and we seek Jehovah by him?' And one of the servants of the king of Israel answereth and saith, `Here `is' Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.'"
12003012,12,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat saith, `The word of Jehovah is with him;' and go down unto him do the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom."
12003013,12,3,13,"And Elisha saith unto the king of Israel, `What -- to me and to thee? go unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the prophets of thy mother;' and the king of Israel saith to him, `Nay, for Jehovah hath called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.'"
12003014,12,3,14,"And Elisha saith, `Jehovah of Hosts liveth, before whom I have stood; for unless the face of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I am lifting up, I do not look unto thee, nor see thee;"
12003015,12,3,15,"and now, bring to me a minstrel; and it hath been, at the playing of the minstrel, that the hand of Jehovah is on him,"
12003016,12,3,16,"and he saith, `Thus said Jehovah, Make this valley ditches -- ditches;"
12003017,12,3,17,"for thus said Jehovah, Ye do not see wind, nor do ye see rain, and that valley is full of water, and ye have drunk -- ye, and your cattle, and your beasts."
12003018,12,3,18,"`And this hath been light in the eyes of Jehovah, and he hath given Moab into your hand,"
12003019,12,3,19,"and ye have smitten every fenced city, and every choice city, and every good tree ye cause to fall, and all fountains of waters ye stop, and every good portion ye mar with stones.'"
12003020,12,3,20,"And it cometh to pass in the morning, at the ascending of the `morning'-present, that lo, waters are coming in from the way of Edom, and the land is filled with the waters,"
12003021,12,3,21,"and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to fight against them, and they are called together, from every one girding on a girdle and upward, and they stand by the border."
12003022,12,3,22,"And they rise early in the morning, and the sun hath shone on the waters, and the Moabites see, from over-against, the waters red as blood,"
12003023,12,3,23,"and say, `Blood this `is'; the kings have been surely destroyed, and they smite each his neighbour; and now for spoil, Moab!'"
12003024,12,3,24,"And they come in unto the camp of Israel, and the Israelites rise, and smite the Moabites, and they flee from their face; and they enter into Moab, so as to smite Moab,"
12003025,12,3,25,"and the cities they break down, and `on' every good portion they cast each his stone, and have filled it, and every fountain of water they stop, and every good tree they cause to fall -- till one had left its stones in Kir-Haraseth, and the slingers go round and smite it."
12003026,12,3,26,"And the king of Moab seeth that the battle has been too strong for him, and he taketh with him seven hundred men, drawing sword, to cleave through unto the king of Edom, and they have not been able,"
12003027,12,3,27,"and he taketh his son, the first-born who reigneth in his stead, and causeth him to ascend -- a burnt-offering on the wall, and there is great wrath against Israel, and they journey from off him, and turn back to the land."
12004001,12,4,1,"And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets hath cried unto Elisha, saying, `Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou hast known that thy servant was fearing Jehovah, and the lender hath come to take my two children to him for servants.'"
12004002,12,4,2,"And Elisha saith unto her, `What do I do for thee? declare to me, what hast thou in the house?' and she saith, `Thy maid-servant hath nothing in the house except a pot of oil.'"
12004003,12,4,3,"And he saith, `Go, ask for thee vessels from without, from all thy neighbours -- empty vessels -- let `them' not be few;"
12004004,12,4,4,"and thou hast entered, and shut the door upon thee, and upon thy sons, and hast poured out into all these vessels, and the full ones thou dost remove.'"
12004005,12,4,5,"And she goeth from him, and shutteth the door upon her, and upon her sons; they are bringing nigh unto her, and she is pouring out,"
12004006,12,4,6,"and it cometh to pass, at the filling of the vessels, that she saith unto her son, `Bring nigh unto me a vessel more,' and he saith unto her, `There is not a vessel more;' and the oil stayeth."
12004007,12,4,7,"And she cometh and declareth to the man of God, and he saith, `Go, sell the oil, and repay thy loan; and thou `and' thy sons do live of the rest.'"
12004008,12,4,8,"And the day cometh that Elisha passeth over unto Shunem, and there `is' a great woman, and she layeth hold on him to eat bread, and it cometh to pass, at the time of his passing over, he turneth aside thither to eat bread,"
12004009,12,4,9,"and she saith unto her husband, `Lo, I pray thee, I have known that a holy man of God he is, passing over by us continually;"
12004010,12,4,10,"let us make, I pray thee, a little upper chamber of the wall, and we set for him there a bed, and a table, and a high seat, and a candlestick; and it hath been, in his coming in unto us, he doth turn aside thither.'"
12004011,12,4,11,"And the day cometh, that he cometh in thither, and turneth aside unto the upper chamber, and lieth there,"
12004012,12,4,12,"and he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Call for this Shunammite;' and he calleth for her, and she standeth before him."
12004013,12,4,13,"And he saith to him, `Say, I pray thee, unto her, Lo, thou hast troubled thyself concerning us with all this trouble; what -- to do for thee? is it to speak for thee unto the king, or unto the head of the host?' and she saith, `In the midst of my people I am dwelling.'"
12004014,12,4,14,"And he saith, `And what -- to do for her?' and Gehazi saith, `Verily she hath no son, and her husband `is' aged.'"
12004015,12,4,15,"And he saith, `Call for her;' and he calleth for her, and she standeth at the opening,"
12004016,12,4,16,"and he saith, `At this season, according to the time of life, thou art embracing a son;' and she saith, `Nay, my lord, O man of God, do not lie unto thy maid-servant.'"
12004017,12,4,17,"And the woman conceiveth and beareth a son, at this season, according to the time of life, that Elisha spake of unto her."
12004018,12,4,18,"And the lad groweth, and the day cometh that he goeth out unto his father, unto the reapers,"
12004019,12,4,19,"and he saith unto his father, `My head, my head;' and he saith unto the young man, `Bear him unto his mother;'"
12004020,12,4,20,"and he beareth him, and bringeth him in unto his mother, and he sitteth on her knees till the noon, and dieth."
12004021,12,4,21,"And she goeth up, and layeth him on the bed of the man of God, and shutteth `the door' upon him, and goeth out,"
12004022,12,4,22,"and calleth unto her husband, and saith, `Send, I pray thee, to me, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I run unto the man of God, and return.'"
12004023,12,4,23,"And he saith, `Wherefore art thou going unto him to-day? -- neither new moon nor sabbath!' and she saith, `Peace `to thee'!'"
12004024,12,4,24,"And she saddleth the ass, and saith unto her young man, `Lead, and go, do not restrain riding for me, except I have said `so' to thee.'"
12004025,12,4,25,"And she goeth, and cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill of Carmel, and it cometh to pass, at the man of God's seeing her from over-against, that he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Lo, this Shunammite;"
12004026,12,4,26,"now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is there peace to thee? is there peace to thy husband? is there peace to the lad?' and she saith, `Peace.'"
12004027,12,4,27,"And she cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill, and layeth hold on his feet, and Gehazi cometh nigh to thrust her away, and the man of God saith, `Let her alone, for her soul `is' bitter to her, and Jehovah hath hidden `it' from me, and hath not declared `it' to me.'"
12004028,12,4,28,"And she saith, `Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?'"
12004029,12,4,29,"And he saith to Gehazi, `Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go; when thou dost meet a man, thou dost not salute him; and when a man doth salute thee, thou dost not answer him; and thou hast laid my staff on the face of the youth.'"
12004030,12,4,30,"And the mother of the youth saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy soul liveth -- if I leave thee;' and he riseth and goeth after her."
12004031,12,4,31,"And Gehazi hath passed on before them, and layeth the staff on the face of the youth, and there is no voice, and there is no attention, and he turneth back to meet him, and declareth to him, saying, `The youth hath not awaked.'"
12004032,12,4,32,"And Elisha cometh in to the house, and lo, the youth is dead, laid on his bed,"
12004033,12,4,33,"and he goeth in and shutteth the door upon them both, and prayeth unto Jehovah."
12004034,12,4,34,"And he goeth up, and lieth down on the lad, and putteth his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands, and stretcheth himself upon him, and the flesh of the lad becometh warm;"
12004035,12,4,35,"and he turneth back and walketh in the house, once hither and once thither, and goeth up and stretcheth himself upon him, and the youth sneezeth till seven times, and the youth openeth his eyes."
12004036,12,4,36,"And he calleth unto Gehazi, and saith, `Call unto this Shunammite;' and he calleth her, and she cometh in unto him, and he saith, `Lift up thy son.'"
12004037,12,4,37,"And she goeth in, and falleth at his feet, and boweth herself to the earth, and lifteth up her son, and goeth out."
12004038,12,4,38,"And Elisha hath turned back to Gilgal, and the famine `is' in the land, and the sons of the prophets are sitting before him, and he saith to his young man, `Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.'"
12004039,12,4,39,"And one goeth out unto the field to gather herbs, and findeth a vine of the field, and gathereth of it gourds of the field -- the fulness of his garment -- and cometh in and splitteth `them' into the pot of pottage, for they knew `them' not;"
12004040,12,4,40,"and they pour out for the men to eat, and it cometh to pass at their eating of the pottage, that they have cried out, and say, `Death `is' in the pot, O man of God!' and they have not been able to eat."
12004041,12,4,41,"And he saith, `Then bring ye meal;' and he casteth into the pot, and saith, `Pour out for the people, and they eat;' and there was no evil thing in the pot."
12004042,12,4,42,"And a man hath come from Baal-Shalishah, and bringeth in to the man of God bread of first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in its husk, and he saith, `Give to the people, and they eat.'"
12004043,12,4,43,"And his minister saith, `What -- do I give this before a hundred men?' and he saith, `Give to the people, and they eat, for thus said Jehovah, Eat and leave;'"
12004044,12,4,44,"and he giveth before them, and they eat and leave, according to the word of Jehovah."
12005001,12,5,1,"And Naaman, head of the host of the king of Aram, was a great man before his lord, and accepted of face, for by him had Jehovah given salvation to Aram, and the man was mighty in valour -- leprous."
12005002,12,5,2,"And the Aramaeans have gone out `by' troops, and they take captive out of the land of Israel a little damsel, and she is before the wife of Naaman,"
12005003,12,5,3,"and she saith unto her mistress, `O that my lord `were' before the prophet who `is' in Samaria; then he doth recover him from his leprosy.'"
12005004,12,5,4,"And `one' goeth in and declareth to his lord, saying, `Thus and thus she hath spoken, the damsel who `is' from the land of Israel.'"
12005005,12,5,5,"And the king of Aram saith, `Go thou, enter, and I send a letter unto the king of Israel;' and he goeth and taketh in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand `pieces' of gold, and ten changes of garments."
12005006,12,5,6,"And he bringeth in the letter unto the king of Israel, saying, `And now, at the coming in of this letter unto thee, lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman my servant, and thou hast recovered him from his leprosy.'"
12005007,12,5,7,"And it cometh to pass, at the king of Israel's reading the letter, that he rendeth his garments, and saith, `Am I God, to put to death and to keep alive, that this `one' is sending unto me to recover a man from his leprosy? for surely know, I pray you, and see, for he is presenting himself to me.'"
12005008,12,5,8,"And it cometh to pass, at Elisha the man of God's hearing that the king of Israel hath rent his garments, that he sendeth unto the king, saying, `Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come, I pray thee, unto me, and he doth know that there is a prophet in Israel.'"
12005009,12,5,9,"And Naaman cometh, with his horses and with his chariot, and standeth at the opening of the house for Elisha;"
12005010,12,5,10,"and Elisha sendeth unto him a messenger, saying, `Go, and thou hast washed seven times in Jordan, and thy flesh doth turn back to thee -- and be thou clean."
12005011,12,5,11,"And Naaman is wroth, and goeth on, and saith, `Lo, I said, Unto me he doth certainly come out, and hath stood and called in the name of Jehovah his God, and waved his hand over the place, and recovered the leper."
12005012,12,5,12,"Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? do I not wash in them and I have been clean?' and he turneth and goeth on in fury."
12005013,12,5,13,"And his servants come nigh, and speak unto him, and say, `My father, a great thing had the prophet spoken unto thee -- dost thou not do `it'? and surely, when he hath said unto thee, Wash, and be clean.'"
12005014,12,5,14,"And he goeth down and dippeth in Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh doth turn back as the flesh of a little youth, and is clean."
12005015,12,5,15,"And he turneth back unto the man of God, he and all his camp, and cometh in, and standeth before him, and saith, `Lo, I pray thee, I have known that there is not a God in all the earth except in Israel; and now, take, I pray thee, a blessing from thy servant.'"
12005016,12,5,16,"And he saith, `Jehovah liveth, before whom I have stood -- if I take `it';' and he presseth on him to take, and he refuseth."
12005017,12,5,17,"And Naaman saith, `If not -- let be given, I pray thee, to thy servant, a couple of mules' burden of earth, for thy servant doth make no more burnt-offering and sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah."
12005018,12,5,18,"For this thing Jehovah be propitious to thy servant, in the coming in of my lord into the house of Rimmon to bow himself there, and he was supported by my hand, and I bowed myself `in' the house of Rimmon; for my bowing myself in the house of Rimmon Jehovah be propitious, I pray thee, to thy servant in this thing.'"
12005019,12,5,19,"And he saith to him, `Go in peace.' And he goeth from him a kibrath of land,"
12005020,12,5,20,"And Gehazi, servant of Elisha the man of God, saith, `Lo, my lord hath spared Naaman this Aramaean, not to receive from his hand that which he brought; Jehovah liveth; surely if I have run after him, then I have taken from him something.'"
12005021,12,5,21,"And Gehazi pursueth after Naaman, and Naaman seeth one running after him, and alighteth from off the chariot to meet him, and saith, `Is there peace?'"
12005022,12,5,22,"And he saith, `Peace; my lord hath sent me, saying, Lo, now, this, come unto me have two young men from the hill-country of Ephraim, of the sons of the prophets; give, I pray thee, to them, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.'"
12005023,12,5,23,"And Naaman saith, `Be pleased, take two talents;' and he urgeth on him, and bindeth two talents of silver in two purses, and two changes of garments, and giveth unto two of his young men, and they bear before him;"
12005024,12,5,24,"and he cometh in unto the high place, and taketh out of their hand, and layeth up in the house, and sendeth away the men, and they go."
12005025,12,5,25,"And he hath come in, and doth stand by his lord, and Elisha saith unto him, `Whence -- Gehazi?' and he saith, `Thy servant went not hither or thither.'"
12005026,12,5,26,"And he saith unto him, `My heart went not when the man turned from off his chariot to meet thee; is it a time to take silver, and to take garments, and olives, and vines, and flock, and herd, and men-servants, and maid-servants?"
12005027,12,5,27,"yea, the leprosy of Naaman doth cleave to thee, and to thy seed, -- to the age;' and he goeth out from before him -- leprous as snow."
12006001,12,6,1,"And sons of the prophet say unto Elisha, `Lo, we pray thee, the place where we are dwelling before thee is too strait for us;"
12006002,12,6,2,"let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and we take thence each one beam, and we make for ourselves there a place to dwell there;' and he saith, `Go.'"
12006003,12,6,3,"And the one saith, `Be pleased, I pray thee, and go with thy servants;' and he saith, `I -- I go.'"
12006004,12,6,4,"And he goeth with them, and they come in to the Jordan, and cut down the trees,"
12006005,12,6,5,"and it cometh to pass, the one is felling the beam, and the iron hath fallen into the water, and he crieth and saith, `Alas! my lord, and it asked!'"
12006006,12,6,6,"And the man of God saith, `Whither hath it fallen?' and he sheweth him the place, and he cutteth a stick, and casteth thither, and causeth the iron to swim,"
12006007,12,6,7,"and saith, `Raise to thee;' and he putteth forth his hand and taketh it."
12006008,12,6,8,"And the king of Aram hath been fighting against Israel, and taketh counsel with his servants, saying, `At such and such a place `is' my encamping.'"
12006009,12,6,9,"And the man of God sendeth unto the king of Israel, saying, `Take heed of passing by this place, for thither are the Aramaeans coming down;"
12006010,12,6,10,"and the king of Israel sendeth unto the place of which the man of God spake to him, and warned him, and he is preserved there not once nor twice."
12006011,12,6,11,"And the heart of the king of Aram is tossed about concerning this thing, and he calleth unto his servants, and saith unto them, `Do ye not declare to me who of us `is' for the king of Israel?'"
12006012,12,6,12,"And one of his servants saith, `Nay, my lord, O king, for Elisha the prophet, who `is' in Israel, declareth to the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in the inner part of thy bed-chamber.'"
12006013,12,6,13,"And he saith, `Go ye and see where he `is', and I send and take him;' and it is declared to him, saying, `Lo -- in Dothan.'"
12006014,12,6,14,"And he sendeth thither horses and chariot, and a heavy force, and they come in by night, and go round against the city."
12006015,12,6,15,"And the servant of the man of God riseth early, and goeth out, and lo, a force is surrounding the city, and horse and chariot, and his young man saith unto him, `Alas! my lord, how do we do?'"
12006016,12,6,16,"And he saith, `Fear not, for more `are' they who `are' with us than they who `are' with them.'"
12006017,12,6,17,"And Elisha prayeth, and saith, `Jehovah, open, I pray Thee, his eyes, and he doth see;' and Jehovah openeth the eyes of the young man, and he seeth, and lo, the hill is full of horses and chariots of fire, round about Elisha."
12006018,12,6,18,"And they come down unto it, and Elisha prayeth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Smite, I pray Thee, this nation with blindness;' and He smiteth them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha."
12006019,12,6,19,"And Elisha saith unto them, `This `is' not the way, nor `is' this the city; come after me, and I lead you unto the man whom ye seek;' and he leadeth them to Samaria."
12006020,12,6,20,"And it cometh to pass, at their coming in to Samaria, that Elisha saith, `Jehovah, open the eyes of these, and they see;' and Jehovah openeth their eyes, and they see, and lo, in the midst of Samaria!"
12006021,12,6,21,"And the king of Israel saith unto Elisha, at his seeing them, `Do I smite -- do I smite -- my father?'"
12006022,12,6,22,"And he saith, `Thou dost not smite; those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow art thou smiting? set bread and water before them, and they eat, and drink, and go unto their lord.'"
12006023,12,6,23,"And he prepareth for them great provision, and they eat and drink, and he sendeth them away, and they go unto their lord: and troops of Aram have not added any more to come in to the land of Israel."
12006024,12,6,24,"And it cometh to pass afterwards, that Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathereth all his camp, and goeth up, and layeth siege to Samaria,"
12006025,12,6,25,"and there is a great famine in Samaria, and lo, they are laying siege to it, till the head of an ass is at eighty silverlings, and a forth of the cab of dovesdung at five silverlings."
12006026,12,6,26,"And it cometh to pass, the king of Israel is passing by on the wall, and a woman hath cried unto him, saying, `Save, my lord, O king.'"
12006027,12,6,27,"And he saith, `Jehovah doth not save thee -- whence do I save thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the wine-vat?'"
12006028,12,6,28,"And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee?' and she saith, `This woman said unto me, Give thy son, and we eat him to-day, and my son we eat to-morrow;"
12006029,12,6,29,"and we boil my son and eat him, and I say unto her on the next day, Give thy son, and we eat him; and she hideth her son.'"
12006030,12,6,30,"And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the woman, that he rendeth his garments, and he is passing by on the wall, and the people see, and lo, the sackcloth `is' on his flesh within."
12006031,12,6,31,"And he saith, `Thus doth God do to me, and thus He doth add -- if it remain -- the head of Elisha son of Shaphat -- upon him this day.'"
12006032,12,6,32,"And Elisha is sitting in his house, and the elders are sitting with him, and `the king' sendeth a man from before him; before the messenger doth come unto him, even he himself said unto the elders, `Have ye seen that this son of the murderer hath sent to turn aside my head? see, at the coming in of the messenger, shut the door, and ye have held him fast at the door, is not the sound of the feet of his lord behind him?'"
12006033,12,6,33,"He is yet speaking with them, and lo, the messenger is coming down unto him, and he saith, `Lo, this `is' the evil from Jehovah: what -- do I wait for Jehovah any more?'"
12007001,12,7,1,"And Elisha saith, `Hear ye a word of Jehovah: thus said Jehovah, About this time to-morrow, a measure of fine flour `is' at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.'"
12007002,12,7,2,"And the captain whom the king hath, by whose hand he hath been supported, answereth the man of God and saith, `Lo, Jehovah is making windows in the heavens -- shall this thing be?' and he saith, `Lo, thou art seeing it with thine eyes, and thereof thou dost not eat.'"
12007003,12,7,3,"And four men have been leprous, at the opening of the gate, and they say one unto another, `What -- we are sitting here till we have died;"
12007004,12,7,4,"if we have said, We go in to the city, then the famine `is' in the city, and we have died there; and if we have sat here, then we have died; and now, come and we fall unto the camp of Aram; if they keep us alive, we live, and if they put us to death -- we have died.'"
12007005,12,7,5,"And they rise in the twilight, to go in unto the camp of Aram, and they come in unto the extremity of the camp of Aram, and lo, there is not a man there,"
12007006,12,7,6,"seeing Jehovah hath caused the camp of Aram to hear a noise of chariot and a noise of horse -- a noise of great force, and they say one unto another, `Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.'"
12007007,12,7,7,"And they rise and flee in the twilight, and forsake their tents, and their horses, and their asses -- the camp as it `is' -- and flee for their life."
12007008,12,7,8,"And these lepers come in unto the extremity of the camp, and come in unto one tent, and eat, and drink, and lift up thence silver, and gold, and garments, and go and hide; and they turn back and go in unto another tent, and lift up thence, and go and hide."
12007009,12,7,9,"And they say one unto another, `We are not doing right this day; a day of tidings it `is', and we are keeping silent; and -- we have waited till the light of the morning, then hath punishment found us; and now, come and we go in and declare to the house of the king.'"
12007010,12,7,10,"And they come in, and call unto the gatekeeper of the city, and declare for themselves, saying, `We have come in unto the camp of Aram, and lo, there is not there a man, or sound of man, but the bound horse, and the bound ass, and tents as they `are'.'"
12007011,12,7,11,"and he calleth the gatekeepers, and they declare to the house of the king within."
12007012,12,7,12,"And the king riseth by night, and saith unto his servants, `Let me declare, I pray you, to you that which the Aramaeans have done to us; they have known that we are famished, and they are gone out from the camp to be hidden in the field, saying, When they come out from the city, then we catch them alive, and unto the city we enter.'"
12007013,12,7,13,"And one of his servants answereth and saith, `Then let them take, I pray thee, five of the horses that are left, that have been left in it -- lo, they `are' as all the multitude of Israel who have been left in it; lo, they are as all the multitude of Israel who have been consumed -- and we send and see.'"
12007014,12,7,14,"And they take two chariot-horses, and the king sendeth after the camp of Aram, saying, `Go, and see.'"
12007015,12,7,15,"And they go after them unto the Jordan, and lo, all the way is full of garments and vessels that the Aramaeans have cast away in their haste, and the messengers turn back and declare to the king."
12007016,12,7,16,"And the people go out and spoil the camp of Aram, and there is a measure of fine flour at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah."
12007017,12,7,17,"And the king hath appointed the captain, by whose hand he is supported, over the gate, and the people tread him down in the gate, and he dieth, as the man of God spake, which he spake in the coming down of the king unto him,"
12007018,12,7,18,"yea, it cometh to pass, according to the speaking of the man of God unto the king, saying, `Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine flour at a shekel are, at this time to-morrow, in the gate of Samaria;'"
12007019,12,7,19,"and the captain answereth the man of God, and saith, `And lo, Jehovah is making windows in the heavens -- it is according to this word?' and he saith, `Lo, thou art seeing with thine eyes, and thereof thou dost not eat;'"
12007020,12,7,20,"and it cometh to him so, and the people tread him down in the gate, and he dieth."
12008001,12,8,1,"And Elisha spake unto the woman whose son he had revived, saying, `Rise and go, thou and thy household, and sojourn where thou dost sojourn, for Jehovah hath called for a famine, and also, it is coming unto the land seven years.'"
12008002,12,8,2,"And the woman riseth, and doth according to the word of the man of God, and goeth, she and her household, and sojourneth in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12008003,12,8,3,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman turneth back from the land of the Philistines, and goeth out to cry unto the king, for her house, and for her field."
12008004,12,8,4,"And the king is speaking unto Gehazi, servant of the man of God, saying, `Recount, I pray thee, to me, the whole of the great things that Elisha hath done.'"
12008005,12,8,5,"And it cometh to pass, he is recounting to the king how he had revived the dead, and lo, the woman whose son he had revived is crying unto the king, for her house and for her field, and Gehazi saith, `My lord, O king, this `is' the woman, and this her son, whom Elisha revived.'"
12008006,12,8,6,"And the king asketh at the woman, and she recounteth to him, and the king appointeth to her a certain eunuch, saying, `Give back all that she hath, and all the increase of the field from the day of her leaving the land even till now.'"
12008007,12,8,7,"And Elisha cometh in to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram is sick, and it is declared to him, saying, `The man of God hath come hither.'"
12008008,12,8,8,"And the king saith unto Hazael, `Take in thy hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and thou hast sought Jehovah by him, saying, Do I revive from this sickness?'"
12008009,12,8,9,"And Hazael goeth to meet him, and taketh a present in his hand, even of every good thing of Damascus, a burden of forty camels, and he cometh in and standeth before him, and saith, `Thy son Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Do I revive from this sickness?'"
12008010,12,8,10,"And Elisha saith unto him, `Go, say, Thou dost certainly not revive, seeing Jehovah hath shewed me that he doth surely die.'"
12008011,12,8,11,"And he setteth his face, yea, he setteth `it' till he is ashamed, and the man of God weepeth."
12008012,12,8,12,"And Hazael saith, `Wherefore is my lord weeping?' and he saith, `Because I have known the evil that thou dost to the sons of Israel -- their fenced places thou dost send into fire, and their young men with sword thou dost slay, and their sucklings thou dost dash to pieces, and their pregnant women thou dost rip up.'"
12008013,12,8,13,"And Hazael saith, `But what, `is' thy servant the dog, that he doth this great thing?' And Elisha saith, `Jehovah hath shewed me thee -- king of Aram.'"
12008014,12,8,14,"And he goeth from Elisha, and cometh in unto his lord, and he saith unto him, `What said Elisha to thee?' and he saith, `He said to me, Thou dost certainly recover.'"
12008015,12,8,15,"And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that he taketh the coarse cloth, and dippeth in water, and spreadeth on his face, and he dieth, and Hazael reigneth in his stead."
12008016,12,8,16,And in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel -- and Jehoshaphat `is' king of Judah -- hath Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah reigned;
12008017,12,8,17,"a son of thirty and two years was he in his reigning, and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem."
12008018,12,8,18,"And he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab was to him for a wife, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,"
12008019,12,8,19,"and Jehovah was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as He said to him, to give to him a lamp -- to his sons all the days."
12008020,12,8,20,"In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they cause a king to reign over them,"
12008021,12,8,21,"and Joram passeth over to Zair, and all the chariots with him, and he himself hath risen by night, and smiteth Edom, that is coming round about unto him, and the heads of the chariots, and the people fleeth to its tents;"
12008022,12,8,22,and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah till this day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time.
12008023,12,8,23,"And the rest of the matters of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12008024,12,8,24,"And Joram lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaziah his son in his stead."
12008025,12,8,25,In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel reigned hath Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah;
12008026,12,8,26,"a son of twenty and two years `is' Ahaziah in his reigning, and one year he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Athaliah daughter of Omri king of Israel,"
12008027,12,8,27,"and he walketh in the way of the house of Ahab, and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for he `is' son-in-law of the house of Ahab."
12008028,12,8,28,"And he goeth with Joram son of Ahab to battle with Hazael king of Aram in Ramoth-Gilead, and the Aramaeans smite Joram,"
12008029,12,8,29,"and Joram the king turneth back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds with which the Arameans smite him in Ramah, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram, and Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah hath gone down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he is sick."
12009001,12,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet hath called to one of the sons of the prophets, and saith to him, `Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead,"
12009002,12,9,2,"and thou hast gone in there, and see thou there Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, and thou hast gone in, and caused him to rise out of the midst of his brethren, and brought him in to the inner part of an inner-chamber,"
12009003,12,9,3,"and taken the vial of oil, and poured on his head, and said, Thus said Jehovah, I have anointed thee for king unto Israel; and thou hast opened the door, and fled, and dost not wait.'"
12009004,12,9,4,"And the young man goeth -- the young man the prophet -- to Ramoth-Gilead,"
12009005,12,9,5,"and cometh in, and lo, chiefs of the force are sitting, and he saith, `I have a word unto thee, O chief!' and Jehu saith, `Unto which of all of us?' and he saith, `Unto thee, O chief.'"
12009006,12,9,6,"And he riseth and cometh in to the house, and he poureth the oil on his head, and saith to him, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I have anointed thee for king unto the people of Jehovah, unto Israel,"
12009007,12,9,7,"and thou hast smitten the house of Ahab thy lord, and I have required the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, from the hand of Jezebel;"
12009008,12,9,8,"and perished hath all the house of Ahab, and I have cut off to Ahab those sitting on the wall, and restrained, and left, in Israel,"
12009009,12,9,9,"and I have given up the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha son of Ahijah,"
12009010,12,9,10,"and Jezebel do the dogs eat in the portion of Jezreel, and there is none burying;' and he openeth the door and fleeth."
12009011,12,9,11,"And Jehu hath gone out unto the servants of his lord, and `one' saith to him, `Is there peace? wherefore came this madman unto thee?' and he saith unto them, `Ye have known the man and his talk.'"
12009012,12,9,12,"And they say, `False, declare, we pray thee, to us;' and he saith, `Thus and thus spake he unto me, saying, Thus said Jehovah, I have anointed thee for king unto Israel.'"
12009013,12,9,13,"And they haste and take each his garment, and put `it' under him at the top of the stairs, and blow with a trumpet, and say, `Reigned hath Jehu!'"
12009014,12,9,14,"And Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspireth against Joram -- (and Joram was keeping in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all Israel, from the presence of Hazael king of Aram,"
12009015,12,9,15,"and king Joram turneth back to be healed in Jezreel, of the wounds with which the Aramaeans smite him, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram) -- and Jehu saith, `If it is your mind, let not an escaped one go out from the city, to go to declare `it' in Jezreel.'"
12009016,12,9,16,"And Jehu rideth, and goeth to Jezreel, for Joram is lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah hath gone down to see Joram."
12009017,12,9,17,"And the watchman is standing on the tower in Jezreel, and seeth the company of Jehu in his coming, and saith, `A company I see;' and Joram saith, `Take a rider and send to meet them, and let him say, Is there peace?'"
12009018,12,9,18,"and the rider on the horse goeth to meet him, and saith, `Thus said the king, Is there peace?' and Jehu saith, `What -- to thee and to peace? turn round behind me.' And the watchman declareth, saying, `The messenger came unto them, and he hath not returned.'"
12009019,12,9,19,"And he sendeth a second rider on a horse, and he cometh in unto them, and saith, `Thus said the king, Is there peace?' and Jehu saith, `What -- to thee and to peace? turn round behind me.'"
12009020,12,9,20,"And the watchman declareth, saying, `He came unto them, and he hath not returned, and the driving `is' like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi, for with madness he driveth.'"
12009021,12,9,21,"And Jehoram saith, `Harness;' and his chariot is harnessed, and Jehoram king of Israel goeth out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each in his chariot, and they go out to meet Jehu, and find him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12009022,12,9,22,"And it cometh to pass, at Jehoram's seeing Jehu, that he saith, `Is there peace, Jehu?' and he saith, `What `is' the peace, while the whoredoms of Jezebel thy mother, and her witchcrafts, are many?'"
12009023,12,9,23,"And Jehoram turneth his hands, and fleeth, and saith unto Ahaziah, `Deceit, O Ahaziah!'"
12009024,12,9,24,"And Jehu hath filled his hand with a bow, and smiteth Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow goeth out from his heart, and he boweth down in his chariot."
12009025,12,9,25,"And `Jehu' saith unto Bidkar his captain, `Lift up, cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite -- for, remember, I and thou were riding together after Ahab his father, and Jehovah lifted upon him this burden:"

12018017,12,18,17,"And the king of Asshur sendeth Tartan, and the chief of the eunuchs, and the chief of the butlers, from Lachish, unto king Hezekiah, with a heavy force, to Jerusalem, and they go up and come in to Jerusalem, and they go up, and come in and stand by the conduit of the upper pool that `is' in the highway of the fuller's field."
12018018,12,18,18,"And they call unto the king, and go out unto them doth Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who `is' over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the remembrancer."
12018019,12,18,19,"And the chief of the butlers saith unto them, `Say, I pray you, unto Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Asshur, What `is' this confidence in which thou hast confided?"
12018020,12,18,20,"Thou hast said: Only a word of the lips! counsel and might `are' for battle; now, on whom hast thou trusted that thou hast rebelled against me?"
12018021,12,18,21,"`Now, lo, thou hast trusted for thee on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; which a man leaneth on, and it hath gone into his hand, and pierced it! -- so `is' Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting on him."
12018022,12,18,22,"`And when ye say unto me, Unto Jehovah our God we have trusted, is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath turned aside, and saith to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar do ye bow yourselves in Jerusalem?"
12018023,12,18,23,"`And, now, give a pledge for thee, I pray thee, to my lord the king of Asshur, and I give to thee two thousand horses, if thou art able to give for thee riders on them."
12018024,12,18,24,"And how dost thou turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord, that thou dost trust for thee on Egypt for chariot, and for horsemen?"
12018025,12,18,25,"Now, without Jehovah have I come up against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and thou hast destroyed it.'"
12018026,12,18,26,"And Eliakim son of Hilkiah saith -- and Shebna, and Joah -- to the chief of the butlers, `Speak, we pray thee, unto thy servants `in' Aramaean, for we are understanding, and do not speak with us `in' Jewish, in the ears of the people who `are' on the wall.'"
12018027,12,18,27,"And the chief of the butlers saith unto them, `For thy lord, and unto thee, hath my lord sent me to speak these words? is it not for the men, those sitting on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water, with you?'"
12018028,12,18,28,"And the chief of the butlers standeth and calleth with a great voice `in' Jewish, and speaketh and saith, `Hear ye a word of the great king, the king of Asshur:"
12018029,12,18,29,"thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah lift you up, for he is not able to deliver you out of his hand;"
12018030,12,18,30,"and let not Hezekiah make you trust unto Jehovah, saying, Jehovah doth certainly deliver us, and this city is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur."
12018031,12,18,31,"`Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus said the king of Asshur, Make with me a blessing, and come out unto me, and eat ye each of his vine, and each of his fig-tree, and drink ye each the waters of his own well,"
12018032,12,18,32,"till my coming in, and I have taken you unto a land like your own land, a land of corn and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive, and honey, and live, and die not; and do not hearken unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah doth deliver us."
12018033,12,18,33,`Have the gods of the nations delivered at all each his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur?
12018034,12,18,34,"Where `are' the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah, that they have delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
12018035,12,18,35,"Who `are they' among all the gods of the lands that have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah doth deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
12018036,12,18,36,"And the people have kept silent, and have not answered him a word, for the command of the king is, saying, `Do not answer him.'"
12018037,12,18,37,"And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who `is' over the house, cometh in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the remembrancer, unto Hezekiah, with rent garments, and they declare to him the words of the chief of the butlers."
12019001,12,19,1,"And it cometh to pass, at king Hezekiah's hearing, that he rendeth his garments, and covereth himself with sackcloth, and entereth the house of Jehovah,"
12019002,12,19,2,"and sendeth Eliakim, who `is' over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covering themselves with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz,"
12019003,12,19,3,"and they say unto him, `Thus said Hezekiah -- A day of distress, and rebuke, and despising `is' this day; for come have sons unto the birth, and power there is not to bring forth."
12019004,12,19,4,"`It may be Jehovah thy God doth hear all the words of the chief of the butlers with which the king of Asshur his lord hath sent him to reproach the living God, and hath decided concerning the words that Jehovah thy God hath heard, and thou hast lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.'"
12019005,12,19,5,"And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah,"
12019006,12,19,6,"and Isaiah saith to them, `Thus do ye say unto your lord: Thus said Jehovah, Be not afraid because of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have reviled Me."
12019007,12,19,7,"Lo, I am giving in him a spirit, and he hath heard a report, and hath turned back to his land, and I have caused him to fall by the sword in his land.'"
12019008,12,19,8,"And the chief of the butlers turneth back and findeth the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he hath heard that he hath journeyed from Lachish."
12019009,12,19,9,"And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, `Lo, he hath come out to fight with thee;' and he turneth and sendeth messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,"
12019010,12,19,10,"`Thus do ye speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God lift thee up in whom thou art trusting, saying, Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur."
12019011,12,19,11,"Lo, thou hast heard that which the kings of Asshur have done to all the lands -- to devote them; and thou art delivered!"
12019012,12,19,12,"did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed -- Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who `are' in Thelassar?"
12019013,12,19,13,"Where `is' the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'"
12019014,12,19,14,"And Hezekiah taketh the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and readeth them, and goeth up to the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah spreadeth it before Jehovah."
12019015,12,19,15,"And Hezekiah prayeth before Jehovah, and saith, `O Jehovah, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubs, Thou `art' God Himself -- Thyself alone -- to all the kingdoms of the earth: Thou hast made the heavens and the earth."
12019016,12,19,16,"Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, and hear; open, O Jehovah, Thine eyes, and see; and hear Thou the words of Sennacherib with which he hath sent him to reproach the living God."
12019017,12,19,17,"`Truly, O Jehovah, kings of Asshur have laid waste the nations, and their land,"
12019018,12,19,18,"and have put their gods into fire, for they `are' no gods, but work of the hands of man, wood and stone, and destroy them."
12019019,12,19,19,"And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, we pray Thee, out of his hand, and know do all kingdoms of the earth that Thou `art' Jehovah God -- Thyself alone.'"
12019020,12,19,20,"And Isaiah son of Amoz sendeth unto Hezekiah, saying, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed unto Me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur I have heard:"
12019021,12,19,21,"this `is' the word that Jehovah spake concerning him: `Trampled on thee -- laughed at thee, Hath the virgin daughter of Zion Behind thee shaken the head -- Hath the daughter of Jerusalem?"
12019022,12,19,22,"Whom hast thou reproached and reviled? And against whom lifted up a voice? Yea, thou dost lift up on high thine eyes -- Against the Holy One of Israel!"
12019023,12,19,23,"By the hand of thy messengers Thou hast reproached the Lord, and sayest: In the multitude of my chariots I have come up to a high place of mountains -- The sides of Lebanon, And I cut down the height of its cedars, The choice of its firs, And I enter the lodging of its extremity, The forest of its Carmel."
12019024,12,19,24,"I have digged, and drunk strange waters, And I dry up with the sole of my steps All floods of a bulwark."
12019025,12,19,25,"Hast thou not heard from afar, it I made, From days of old that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, And it becometh a desolation, Ruinous heaps `are' fenced cities,"
12019026,12,19,26,"And their inhabitants `are' feeble-handed, They were broken down, and are dried up, They have been the herb of the field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the roofs, And blasted corn -- before it hath risen up!"
12019027,12,19,27,"And thy sitting down, and thy going out, And thy coming in, I have known, And thine anger towards Me;"
12019028,12,19,28,"Because of thine anger towards Me, And thy noise -- it came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in thy nose, And My bridle in thy lips, And have caused thee to turn back, In the way in which thou camest."
12019029,12,19,29,"And this to thee `is' the sign, Food of the year `is' the spontaneous growth, And in the second year the self-produced, And in the third year sow ye, and reap, And plant vineyards, and eat their fruits."
12019030,12,19,30,"And it hath continued -- The escaped of the house of Judah That hath been left -- to take root beneath, And hath made fruit upward."
12019031,12,19,31,"For from Jerusalem goeth out a remnant, And an escape from mount Zion; The zeal of Jehovah `of Hosts' doth this."
12019032,12,19,32,"Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Concerning the king of Asshur: He doth not come in unto this city, Nor doth he shoot there an arrow, Nor doth he come before it with shield. Nor doth he pour out against it a mount."
12019033,12,19,33,"In the way that he cometh in -- In it he turneth back, And unto this city he doth not come in, The affirmation of Jehovah --"
12019034,12,19,34,"And I have covered over this city, To save it, for Mine own sake, And for the sake of David My servant.'"
12019035,12,19,35,"And it cometh to pass, in that night, that a messenger of Jehovah goeth out, and smiteth in the camp of Asshur a hundred eighty and five thousand, and they rise early in the morning, and lo, all of them `are' dead corpses."
12019036,12,19,36,"And Sennacherib king of Asshur journeyeth, and goeth, and turneth back, and dwelleth in Nineveh;"
12019037,12,19,37,"and it cometh to pass, he is bowing himself in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezar `his sons' have smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead."
12020001,12,20,1,"In those days hath Hezekiah been sick unto death, and come unto him doth Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, and saith unto him, `Thus said Jehovah: Give a charge to thy house, for thou art dying, and dost not live.'"
12020002,12,20,2,"And he turneth round his face unto the wall, and prayeth unto Jehovah, saying,"
12020003,12,20,3,"`I pray Thee, O Jehovah, remember, I pray Thee, how I have walked habitually before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and that which `is' good in Thine eyes I have done;' and Hezekiah weepeth -- a great weeping."
12020004,12,20,4,"And it cometh to pass -- Isaiah hath not gone out to the middle court -- that the word of Jehovah hath been unto him, saying,"
12020005,12,20,5,"`Turn back, and thou hast said unto Hezekiah, leader of My people: Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tear, lo, I give healing to thee, on the third day thou dost go up to the house of Jehovah;"
12020006,12,20,6,"and I have added to thy days fifteen years, and out of the hand of the king of Asshur I deliver thee and this city, and have covered over this city for Mine own sake, and for the sake of David My servant.'"
12020007,12,20,7,"And Isaiah saith, `Take ye a cake of figs;' and they take and lay `it' on the boil, and he reviveth."
12020008,12,20,8,"And Hezekiah saith unto Isaiah, `What `is' the sign that Jehovah doth give healing to me, that I have gone up on the third day to the house of Jehovah?'"
12020009,12,20,9,"And Isaiah saith, `This `is' to thee the sign from Jehovah, that Jehovah doth the thing that He hath spoken -- The shadow hath gone on ten degrees, or it doth turn back ten degrees?'"
12020010,12,20,10,"And Hezekiah saith, `It hath been light for the shadow to incline ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow turn backward ten degrees.'"
12020011,12,20,11,"And Isaiah the prophet calleth unto Jehovah, and He bringeth back the shadow by the degrees that it had gone down in the degrees of Ahaz -- backward ten degrees."
12020012,12,20,12,"At that time hath Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick;"
12020013,12,20,13,"and Hezekiah hearkeneth unto them, and sheweth them all the house of his treasury, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his vessels, and all that hath been found in his treasuries; there hath not been a thing that Hezekiah hath not shewed them, in his house, and in all his dominion."
12020014,12,20,14,"And Isaiah the prophet cometh in unto king Hezekiah, and saith unto him, `What said these men? and whence come they unto thee?' And Hezekiah saith, `From a land afar off they have come -- from Babylon.'"
12020015,12,20,15,"And he saith, `What saw they in thy house?' and Hezekiah saith, `All that `is' in my house they saw; there hath not been a thing that I have not shewed them among my treasures.'"
12020016,12,20,16,"And Isaiah saith unto Hezekiah, `Hear a word of Jehovah:"
12020017,12,20,17,"Lo, days are coming, and borne hath been all that `is' in thy house, and that thy father have treasured up till this day, to Babylon; there is not left a thing, said Jehovah;"
12020018,12,20,18,"and of thy sons who go out from thee, whom thou begettest, they take away, and they have been eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
12020019,12,20,19,"And Hezekiah saith unto Isaiah, `Good `is' the word of Jehovah that thou hast spoken;' and he saith, `Is it not -- if peace and truth are in my days?'"
12020020,12,20,20,"And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and bringeth in the waters to the city, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12020021,12,20,21,"And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and reign doth Manasseh his son in his stead."
12021001,12,21,1,"A son of twelve years `is' Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Hephzi-Bah;"
12021002,12,21,2,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,"
12021003,12,21,3,"and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah his father destroyed, and raiseth altars for Baal, and maketh a shrine, as did Ahab king of Israel, and boweth himself to all the host of the heavens, and serveth them."
12021004,12,21,4,"And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah said, `In Jerusalem I put My name.'"
12021005,12,21,5,And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah;
12021006,12,21,6,"and he hath caused his son to pass through fire, and observed clouds, and used enchantment, and dealt with a familiar spirit and wizards; he hath multiplied to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah -- to provoke to anger."
12021007,12,21,7,"And he setteth the graven image of the shrine that he made in the house of which Jehovah said unto David and unto Solomon his son, `In this house, and in Jerusalem, that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name -- to the age;"
12021008,12,21,8,"and I do not add to cause the foot of Israel to move from the ground that I gave to their fathers, only, if they observe to do according to all that I commanded them, and to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.'"
12021009,12,21,9,"And they have not hearkened, and Manasseh causeth them to err, to do the evil thing above the nations that Jehovah destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel."
12021010,12,21,10,"And Jehovah speaketh by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,"
12021011,12,21,11,"`Because that Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations -- he hath done evil above all that the Amorites have done who `are' before him, and causeth also Judah to sin by his idols;"
12021012,12,21,12,"therefore thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Lo, I am bringing in evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth of it, tingle do his two ears."
12021013,12,21,13,"And I have stretched out over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and wiped Jerusalem as one wipeth the dish -- he hath wiped, and hath turned `it' on its face."
12021014,12,21,14,"`And I have left the remnant of Mine inheritance, and given them into the hand of their enemies, and they have been for a prey and for a spoil to all their enemies,"
12021015,12,21,15,"because that they have done the evil thing in Mine eyes, and are provoking Me to anger from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt, even unto this day.'"
12021016,12,21,16,"And also, innocent blood hath Manasseh shed very much, till that he hath filled Jerusalem -- mouth to mouth; apart from his sin that he hath caused Judah to sin, to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah."
12021017,12,21,17,"And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12021018,12,21,18,"And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and reign doth Amon his son in his stead."
12021019,12,21,19,"A son of twenty and two years `is' Amon in his reigning, and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz of Jotbah,"
12021020,12,21,20,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father,"
12021021,12,21,21,"and walketh in all the way that his father walked in, and serveth the idols that his father served, and boweth himself to them,"
12021022,12,21,22,"and forsaketh Jehovah, God of his fathers, and hath not walked in the way of Jehovah."
12021023,12,21,23,"And the servants of Amon conspire against him, and put the king to death in his own house,"
12021024,12,21,24,"and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his son to reign in his stead."
12021025,12,21,25,"And the rest of the matters of Amon that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12021026,12,21,26,"and `one' burieth him in his burying-place in the garden of Uzza, and reign doth Josiah his son in his stead."
12022001,12,22,1,"A son of eight years `is' Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Boskath,"
12022002,12,22,2,"and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walketh in all the way of David his father, and hath not turned aside -- right or left."
12022003,12,22,3,"And it cometh to pass, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king hath sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,"
12022004,12,22,4,"`Go up unto Hilkiah the high priest, and he doth complete the silver that is brought into the house of Jehovah, that the keepers of the threshold have gathered from the people,"
12022005,12,22,5,"and they give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the overseers, in the house of Jehovah, and they give it to the doers of the work that `is' in the house of Jehovah, to strengthen the breach of the house,"
12022006,12,22,6,"to artificers, and to builders, and `to repairers of' the wall, and to buy wood and hewn stones to strengthen the house;"
12022007,12,22,7,"only, the silver that is given into their hand is not reckoned with them, for in faithfulness they are dealing."
12022008,12,22,8,"And Hilkiah the high priest saith unto Shaphan the scribe, `A book of the law I have found in the house of Jehovah;' and Hilkiah giveth the book unto Shaphan, and he readeth it."
12022009,12,22,9,"And Shaphan the scribe cometh in unto the king, and bringeth the king back word, and saith, `Thy servants have poured out the silver that hath been found in the house, and give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the inspectors, in the house of Jehovah.'"
12022010,12,22,10,"And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, `A book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth it before the king."
12022011,12,22,11,"And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the book of the law, that he rendeth his garments,"
12022012,12,22,12,"and the king commandeth Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah servant of the king, saying,"
12022013,12,22,13,"`Go, seek Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found, for great `is' the fury of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because that our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according to all that is written for us.'"
12022014,12,22,14,"And Hilkiah the priest goeth, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the second, and they speak unto her."
12022015,12,22,15,"And she saith unto them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Say to the man who hath sent you unto me:"
12022016,12,22,16,"Thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am bringing in evil unto this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah hath read,"
12022017,12,22,17,"because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me to anger with every work of their hands, and My wrath hath been kindled against this place, and it is not quenched."
12022018,12,22,18,"`And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to seek Jehovah, thus do ye say unto him, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The words that thou hast heard --"
12022019,12,22,19,"because thy heart `is' tender, and thou art humbled because of Jehovah, in thy hearing that which I have spoken against this place, and against its inhabitants, to be for a desolation, and for a reviling, and dost rend thy garments, and weep before Me -- I also have heard -- the affirmation of Jehovah --"
12022020,12,22,20,"therefore, lo, I am gathering thee unto thy fathers, and thou hast been gathered unto thy grave in peace, and thine eyes do not look on any of the evil that I am bringing in on this place;' and they bring the king back word."
12023001,12,23,1,"And the king sendeth, and they gather unto him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem,"
12023002,12,23,2,"and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah, and every man of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from small unto great, and he readeth in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Jehovah."
12023003,12,23,3,"And the king standeth by the pillar, and maketh the covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all the heart, and with all the soul, to establish the words of this covenant that are written on this book, and all the people stand in the covenant."
12023004,12,23,4,"And the king commandeth Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out from the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that are made for Baal, and for the shrine, and for all the host of the heavens, and he burneth them at the outside of Jerusalem, in the fields of Kidron, and hath borne their ashes to Beth-El."
12023005,12,23,5,"And he hath caused to cease the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah have appointed, (and they make perfume in high places, in cities of Judah and suburbs of Jerusalem,) and those making perfume to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of the heavens."
12023006,12,23,6,"And he bringeth out the shrine from the house of Jehovah to the outside of Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burneth it at the brook Kidron, and beateth it small to dust, and casteth its dust on the grave of the sons of the people."
12023007,12,23,7,"And he breaketh down the houses of the whoremongers that `are' in the house of Jehovah, where the women are weaving houses for the shrine."
12023008,12,23,8,"And he bringeth in all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defileth the high places where the priests have made perfume, from Geba unto Beer-Sheba, and hath broken down the high places of the gates that `are' at the opening of the gate of Joshua, head of the city, that `is' on a man's left hand at the gate of the city;"
12023009,12,23,9,"only, the priests of the high places come not up unto the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they have eaten unleavened things in the midst of their brethren."
12023010,12,23,10,"And he hath defiled Topheth, that `is' in the valley of the son of Hinnom, so that no man doth cause his son and his daughter to pass over through fire to Molech."
12023011,12,23,11,"And he causeth to cease the horses that the kings of Judah have given to the sun from the entering in of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, that `is' in the suburbs, and the chariots of the sun he hath burnt with fire."
12023012,12,23,12,"And the altars that `are' on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, that the kings of Judah made, and the altars that Manasseh made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, hath the king broken down, and removeth thence, and hath cast their dust unto the brook Kidron."
12023013,12,23,13,"And the high places that `are' on the front of Jerusalem, that `are' on the right of the mount of corruption, that Solomon king of Israel had built to Ashtoreth abomination of the Zidonians, and Chemosh abomination of Moab, and to Milcom abomination of the sons of Ammon, hath the king defiled."
12023014,12,23,14,"And he hath broken in pieces the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines, and filleth their place with bones of men;"
12023015,12,23,15,"and also the altar that `is' in Beth-El, the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat made, by which he made Israel sin, both that altar and the high place he hath broken down, and doth burn the high place -- he hath beat it small to dust, and hath burnt the shrine."
12023016,12,23,16,"And Josiah turneth, and seeth the graves that `are' there in the mount, and sendeth and taketh the bones out of the graves, and burneth `them' on the altar, and defileth it, according to the word of Jehovah that the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things."
12023017,12,23,17,"And he saith, `What `is' this sign that I see?' and the men of the city say unto him, `The grave of the man of God who hath come from Judah, and proclaimeth these things that thou hast done concerning the altar of Beth-El.'"
12023018,12,23,18,"And he saith, `Let him alone, let no man touch his bones;' and they let his bones escape, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria."
12023019,12,23,19,"And also all the houses of the high places that `are' in the cities of Samaria, that the kings of Israel made to provoke to anger, hath Josiah turned aside, and doth to them according to all the deeds that he did in Beth-El."
12023020,12,23,20,"And he slayeth all the priests of the high places who `are' there by the altars, and burneth the bones of man upon them, and turneth back to Jerusalem."
12023021,12,23,21,"And the king commandeth the whole of the people, saying, `Make ye a passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written on this book of the covenant.'"
12023022,12,23,22,"Surely there hath not been made like this passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah;"
12023023,12,23,23,"but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, hath this passover been made to Jehovah in Jerusalem."
12023024,12,23,24,"And also, those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah, and in Jerusalem, hath Josiah put away, in order to establish the words of the law that are written on the book that Hilkiah the priest hath found in the house of Jehovah."
12023025,12,23,25,"And like him there hath not been before him a king who turned back unto Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there hath none risen like him."
12023026,12,23,26,"Only, Jehovah hath not turned back from the fierceness of His great anger with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh provoked him,"
12023027,12,23,27,"and Jehovah saith, `Also Judah I turn aside from my presence, as I turned Israel aside, and I have rejected this city that I have chosen -- Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name is there.'"
12023028,12,23,28,"And the rest of the matters of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12023029,12,23,29,"In his days hath Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt come up against the king of Asshur, by the river Phrat, and king Josiah goeth out to meet him, and he putteth him to death in Megiddo, when he seeth him."
12023030,12,23,30,"And his servants cause him to ride dying from Megiddo, and bring him in to Jerusalem, and bury him in his own grave, and the people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and anoint him, and cause him to reign instead of his father."
12023031,12,23,31,"A son of twenty and three years `is' Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,"
12023032,12,23,32,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers did,"
12023033,12,23,33,"and Pharaoh-Nechoh bindeth him in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, from reigning in Jerusalem, and he putteth a fine on the land -- a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
12023034,12,23,34,"And Pharaoh-Nechoh causeth Eliakim son of Josiah to reign instead of Josiah his father, and turneth his name to Jehoiakim, and Jehoahaz he hath taken away, and he cometh in to Egypt, and dieth there."
12023035,12,23,35,"And the silver and the gold hath Jehoiakim given to Pharaoh; only he valued the land to give the silver by the command of Pharaoh; from each, according to his valuation, he exacted the silver and the gold, from the people of the land, to give to Pharaoh-Nechoh."
12023036,12,23,36,"A son of twenty and five years `is' Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Zebudah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah,"

12024001,12,24,1,"In his days hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and Jehoiakim is to him a servant three years; and he turneth and rebelleth against him,"
12024002,12,24,2,"and Jehovah sendeth against him the troops of the Chaldeans, and the troops of Aram, and the troops of Moab, and the troops of the sons of Ammon, and He sendeth them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, that He spake by the hand of His servants the prophets;"
12024003,12,24,3,"only, by the command of Jehovah it hath been against Judah to turn `them' aside from His presence, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,"
12024004,12,24,4,"and also the innocent blood that he hath shed, and he filleth Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Jehovah was not willing to forgive."
12024005,12,24,5,"And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12024006,12,24,6,"And Jehoiakim lieth with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigneth in his stead."
12024007,12,24,7,"And the king of Egypt hath not added any more to go out from his own land, for the king of Babylon hath taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Phrat, all that had been to the king of Egypt."
12024008,12,24,8,"A son of eighteen years `is' Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem,"
12024009,12,24,9,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers did."
12024010,12,24,10,"At that time come up have servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city goeth into siege,"
12024011,12,24,11,"and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon cometh against the city, and his servants are laying siege to it,"
12024012,12,24,12,"and Jehoiachin king of Judah goeth out unto the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his eunuchs, and the king of Babylon taketh him in the eighth year of his reign,"
12024013,12,24,13,"and bringeth out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king, and cutteth in pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had spoken."
12024014,12,24,14,"And he hath removed all Jerusalem, and all the chiefs, and all the mighty ones of valour -- ten thousand `is' the removal -- and every artificer and smith, none hath been left save the poor of the people of the land."
12024015,12,24,15,"And he removeth Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs, and the mighty ones of the land -- he hath caused a removal to go from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
12024016,12,24,16,"and all the men of valour seven thousand, and the artificers and the smiths a thousand, the whole `are' mighty men, warriors; and the king of Babylon bringeth them in a captivity to Babylon."
12024017,12,24,17,"And the king of Babylon causeth Mattaniah his father's brother to reign in his stead, and turneth his name to Zedekiah."
12024018,12,24,18,"A son of twenty and one years `is' Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,"
12024019,12,24,19,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah according to all that Jehoiakim did,"
12024020,12,24,20,"for, by the anger of Jehovah it hath been against Jerusalem and against Judah, till he cast them out from His presence, that Zedekiah rebelleth against the king of Babylon."
12025001,12,25,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, come hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, he and all his force, against Jerusalem, and encampeth against it, and buildeth against it a fortification round about."
12025002,12,25,2,"And the city entereth into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah,"
12025003,12,25,3,"on the ninth of the month -- when the famine is severe in the city, and there hath not been bread for the people of the land,"
12025004,12,25,4,"then the city is broken up, and all the men of war `go' by night the way of the gate, between the two walls that `are' by the garden of the king, and the Chaldeans `are' against the city round about, and `the king' goeth the way of the plain."
12025005,12,25,5,"And the force of the Chaldeans pursue after the king, and overtake him in the plains of Jericho, and all his force have been scattered from him;"
12025006,12,25,6,"and they seize the king, and bring him up unto the king of Babylon, to Riblah, and they speak with him -- judgment."
12025007,12,25,7,"And the sons of Zedekiah they have slaughtered before his eyes, and the eyes of Zedekiah he hath blinded, and bindeth him with brazen fetters, and they bring him to Babylon."
12025008,12,25,8,"And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month (it `is' the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), hath Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners, servant of the king of Babylon, come to Jerusalem,"
12025009,12,25,9,"and he burneth the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, yea, every great house he hath burned with fire;"
12025010,12,25,10,"and the walls of Jerusalem round about have all the forces of the Chaldeans, who `are' with the chief of the executioners, broken down."
12025011,12,25,11,"And the rest of the people, those left in the city, and those falling who have fallen to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude, hath Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners removed;"
12025012,12,25,12,and of the poor of the land hath the chief of the executioners left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
12025013,12,25,13,"And the pillars of brass that `are' in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the sea of brass, that `is' in the house of Jehovah, have the Chaldeans broken in pieces, and bear away their brass to Babylon."
12025014,12,25,14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they minister they have taken,"
12025015,12,25,15,"and the fire-pans, and the bowls that `are' wholly of silver, hath the chief of the executioners taken."
12025016,12,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah, there was no weighing of the brass of all these vessels;"
12025017,12,25,17,"eighteen cubits `is' the height of the one pillar, and the chapiter on it `is' of brass, and the height of the chapiter `is' three cubits, and the net and the pomegranates `are' on the chapiter round about -- the whole `is' of brass; and like these hath the second pillar, with the net."
12025018,12,25,18,"And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold,"
12025019,12,25,19,"and out of the city he hath taken a certain eunuch who is appointed over the men of war, and five men of those seeing the king's face who have been found in the city, and the head scribe of the host, who mustereth the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who are found in the city,"
12025020,12,25,20,"and Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners taketh them, and causeth them to go unto the king of Babylon, to Libnah,"
12025021,12,25,21,"and the king of Babylon smiteth them, and putteth them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he removeth Judah from off its land."
12025022,12,25,22,"And the people that is left in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath left -- he appointeth over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan."
12025023,12,25,23,"And all the heads of the forces hear -- they and the men -- that the king of Babylon hath appointed Gedaliah, and they come in unto Gedaliah, to Mizpah, even Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maachathite -- they and their men;"
12025024,12,25,24,"and Gedaliah sweareth to them, and to their men, and saith to them, `Be not afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans, dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it is good for you.'"
12025025,12,25,25,"And it cometh to pass, in the seventh month, come hath Ishmael son of Nathaniah, son of Elishama of the seed of the kingdom, and ten men with him, and they smite Gedaliah, and he dieth, and the Jews and the Chaldeans who have been with him in Mizpah."
12025026,12,25,26,"And all the people rise, from small even unto great, and the heads of the forces, and come in to Egypt, for they have been afraid of the presence of the Chaldeans."
12025027,12,25,27,"And it cometh to pass, in the thirty and seventh year of the removal of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and seventh of the month hath Evil-Merodach king of Babylon lifted up, in the year of his reigning, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, out of the house of restraint,"
12025028,12,25,28,"and speaketh with him good things and putteth his throne above the throne of the kings who `are' with him in Babylon,"
12025029,12,25,29,"and hath changed the garments of his restraint, and he hath eaten bread continually before him all days of his life,"

13009043,13,9,43,"and Moza begat Binea, and Rephaiah `is' his son. Eleasah his son, Azel his son."
13009044,13,9,44,"And to Azel `are' six sons, and these their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these `are' sons of Azel."
13010001,13,10,1,"And the Philistines have fought with Israel, and the men of Israel flee from the face of the Philistines, and fall wounded in mount Gilboa,"
13010002,13,10,2,"and the Philistines pursue after Saul, and after his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-Shua, sons of Saul."
13010003,13,10,3,"And the battle `is' heavy on Saul, and those shooting with the bow find him, and he is wounded by those shooting,"
13010004,13,10,4,"and Saul saith unto the bearer of his weapons, `Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest these uncircumcised come -- and have abused me.' And the bearer of his weapons hath not been willing, for he feareth exceedingly, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it;"
13010005,13,10,5,"and the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul `is' dead, and falleth, he also, on the sword, and dieth;"
13010006,13,10,6,"and Saul dieth, and his three sons, and all his house -- together they died."
13010007,13,10,7,"And all the men of Israel who `are' in the valley see that they have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake their cities and flee, and the Philistines come and dwell in them."
13010008,13,10,8,"And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and find Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa,"
13010009,13,10,9,"and strip him, and bear away his head, and his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about to proclaim tidings `to' their idols and the people,"
13010010,13,10,10,"and put his weapons in the house of their gods, and his skull they have fixed in the house of Dagon."
13010011,13,10,11,"And all Jabesh-Gilead hear of all that the Philistines have done to Saul,"
13010012,13,10,12,"and all the men of valour rise and bear away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and bring them in to Jabesh, and bury their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fast seven days."
13010013,13,10,13,"And Saul dieth because of his trespass that he trespassed against Jehovah, against the word of Jehovah that he kept not, and also for asking at a familiar spirit -- to inquire, --"
13010014,13,10,14,"and he inquired not at Jehovah, and He putteth him to death, and turneth round the kingdom to David son of Jesse."
13011001,13,11,1,"And gathered are all Israel unto David to Hebron, saying, `Lo, thy bone and thy flesh `are' we;"
13011002,13,11,2,"even in time past, even in Saul's being king, it is thou who art taking out and bringing in Israel, and Jehovah thy God saith to thee: Thou dost feed My people Israel, and thou art leader over My people Israel.'"
13011003,13,11,3,"And all the elders of Israel come in unto the king to Hebron, and David maketh with them a covenant in Hebron before Jehovah, and they anoint David for king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by the hand of Samuel."
13011004,13,11,4,"And David goeth, and all Israel, to Jerusalem -- it `is' Jebus -- and there the Jebusite, the inhabitants of the land."
13011005,13,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus say to David, `Thou dost not come in hither;' and David captureth the fortress of Zion -- it `is' the city of David."
13011006,13,11,6,"And David saith, `Whoever smiteth the Jebusite first doth become head and prince;' and go up first doth Joab son of Zeruiah and becometh head."
13011007,13,11,7,"And David dwelleth in the fortress, therefore they have called it, `City of David;'"
13011008,13,11,8,"and he buildeth the city round about, from Millo, and unto the circumference, and Joab restoreth the rest of the city."
13011009,13,11,9,"And David goeth, going on and becoming great, and Jehovah of Hosts `is' with him."
13011010,13,11,10,"And these `are' heads of the mighty ones whom David hath, who are strengthening themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to cause him to reign, according to the word of Jehovah, over Israel."
13011011,13,11,11,"And this `is' an account of the mighty ones whom David hath: Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite `is' head of the thirty; he is lifting up his spear against three hundred -- wounded, at one time."
13011012,13,11,12,"And after him `is' Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, he `is' among the three mighty;"
13011013,13,11,13,"he hath been with David in Pas-Dammim, and the Philistines have been gathered there to battle, and a portion of the field is full of barley, and the people have fled from the face of the Philistines,"
13011014,13,11,14,"and they station themselves in the midst of the portion, and deliver it, and smite the Philistines, and Jehovah saveth -- a great salvation."
13011015,13,11,15,"And three of the thirty heads go down on the rock unto David, unto the cave of Adullam, and the host of the Philistines is encamping in the valley of Rephaim,"
13011016,13,11,16,"and David `is' then in the fortress, and the station of the Philistines `is' then in Beth-Lehem,"
13011017,13,11,17,"and David longeth, and saith, `Who doth give me to drink water from the well of Beth-Lehem, that `is' at the gate!'"
13011018,13,11,18,"And the three break through the camp of the Philistines, and draw water from the well of Beth-Lehem, that `is' at the gate, and bear and bring in unto David, and David hath not been willing to drink it, and poureth it out to Jehovah,"
13011019,13,11,19,"and saith, `Far be it from me, by my God, to do this; the blood of these men do I drink with their lives? for with their lives they have brought it;' and he was not willing to drink it; these `things' did the three mighty ones."
13011020,13,11,20,"And Abishai brother of Joab, he hath been head of the three: and he is lifting up his spear against three hundred -- wounded, and hath a name among three."
13011021,13,11,21,"Of the three by the two he is honoured, and becometh their head; and unto the `first' three he hath not come."
13011022,13,11,22,"Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a man of valour, of great deeds, from Kabzeel: he hath smitten the two lion-like Moabites, and he hath gone down and smitten the lion in the midst of the pit, in the day of snow."
13011023,13,11,23,"And he hath smitten the man, the Egyptian -- a man of measure, five by the cubit -- and in the hand of the Egyptian `is' a spear like a beam of weavers, and he goeth down unto him with a rod, and taketh violently away the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slayeth him with his own spear."
13011024,13,11,24,"These `things' hath Benaiah son of Jehoiada done, and hath a name among the three mighty ones."
13011025,13,11,25,"Of the thirty, lo, he `is' honoured, and unto the `first' three he hath not come, and David setteth him over his guard."

13012018,13,12,18,"And the Spirit hath clothed Amasai, head of the captains: `To thee, O David, and with thee, O son of Jesse -- peace! peace to thee, and peace to thy helper, for thy God hath helped thee;' and David receiveth them, and putteth them among the heads of the troop."
13012019,13,12,19,"And of Manasseh there have fallen unto David in his coming with the Philistines against Israel to battle -- and they helped them not, for by counsel the princes of the Philistines sent him away, saying, `With our heads he doth fall unto his master Saul.' --"

13012040,13,12,40,"And also those near unto them, unto Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, are bringing in bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen -- food of fine flour, fig-cakes and grape-cakes, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep, in abundance, for joy `is' in Israel."
13013001,13,13,1,"And David consulteth with the heads of the thousands, and of the hundreds, every leader,"
13013002,13,13,2,"and David saith to all the assembly of Israel, `If unto you it be good, and from Jehovah our God it hath broken forth -- we send unto our brethren, those left in all the lands of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites, in the cities of their suburbs, and they are gathered unto us,"
13013003,13,13,3,"and we bring round the ark of our God unto us, for we sought Him not in the days of Saul.'"
13013004,13,13,4,"And all the assembly say to do so, for the thing is right in the eyes of all the people."
13013005,13,13,5,"And David assembleth all Israel from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering in of Hamath, to bring in the ark of God from Kirjath-Jearim,"
13013006,13,13,6,"and David goeth up, and all Israel, to Baalah, unto Kirjath-Jearim that `is' to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God Jehovah, inhabiting the cherubs, where the Name is called on."
13013007,13,13,7,"And they place the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio are leading the cart,"

13013010,13,13,10,"and the anger of Jehovah is kindled against Uzza, and He smiteth him, because that he hath put forth his hand on the ark, and he dieth there before God."
13013011,13,13,11,"And it is displeasing to David, because Jehovah hath made a breach upon Uzza, and one calleth that place `Breach of Uzza' unto this day."
13013012,13,13,12,"And David feareth God on that day, saying, `How do I bring in unto me the ark of God?'"
13013013,13,13,13,"And David hath not turned aside the ark unto himself, unto the city of David, and turneth it aside unto the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite."
13013014,13,13,14,"And the ark of God dwelleth with the household of Obed-Edom, in his house, three months, and Jehovah blesseth the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he hath."
13014001,13,14,1,"And Huram king of Tyre sendeth messengers unto David, and cedar-wood, and artificers of walls, and artificers of wood, to build to him a house."
13014002,13,14,2,"And David knoweth that Jehovah hath established him for king over Israel, because of the lifting up on high of his kingdom, for the sake of His people Israel."

13014009,13,14,9,"And the Philistines have come, and rush into the valley of Rephaim,"
13014010,13,14,10,"and David asketh of God, saying, `Do I go up against the Philistines -- and hast Thou given them into my hand?' And Jehovah saith to him, `Go up, and I have given them into thy hand.'"
13014011,13,14,11,"And they go up into Baal-Perazim, and David smiteth them there, and David saith, `God hath broken up mine enemies by my hand, like the breaking up of waters;' therefore they have called the name of that place Baal-Perazim."
13014012,13,14,12,"And they leave there their gods, and David speaketh, and they are burnt with fire."
13014013,13,14,13,"And the Philistines add again, and rush into the valley,"
13014014,13,14,14,"and David asketh again of God, and God saith to him, `Do not go up after them, turn round from them, and thou hast come to them from over-against the mulberries;"
13014015,13,14,15,"and it cometh to pass, when thou hearest the sound of the stepping at the heads of the mulberries, then thou goest out into battle, for God hath gone out before thee to smite the camp of the Philistines.'"
13014016,13,14,16,"And David doth as God commanded him, and they smite the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gazer;"
13014017,13,14,17,"and the name of David goeth out into all the lands, and Jehovah hath put his fear on all the nations."
13015001,13,15,1,"And he maketh for himself houses in the city of David, and prepareth a place for the ark of God, and stretcheth out for it a tent."
13015002,13,15,2,"Then said David, `None `are' to carry the ark of God, except the Levites, for on them hath Jehovah fixed to carry the ark of God, and to serve Him -- unto the age.'"
13015003,13,15,3,"And David assembleth all Israel unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place that he had prepared for it."
13015004,13,15,4,"And David gathereth the sons of Aaron, and the Levites."
13015005,13,15,5,"Of sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty."
13015006,13,15,6,"Of sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty."

13015011,13,15,11,"And David calleth to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, and to the Levites, to Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,"
13015012,13,15,12,"and saith to them, `Ye `are' heads of the fathers of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, ye and your brethren, and ye have brought up the ark of Jehovah, God of Israel, unto `the place' I have prepared for it;"
13015013,13,15,13,"because at the first `it was' not ye, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, because we sought Him not according to the ordinance.'"
13015014,13,15,14,"And the priests and the Levites sanctify themselves, to bring up the ark of Jehovah, God of Israel;"

13015020,13,15,20,"and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jeheil, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries besides virgins,"
13015021,13,15,21,"and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps, on the octave, to oversee."
13015022,13,15,22,"And Chenaniah, head of the Levites, `is' over the burden; he instructeth about the burden, for he `is' intelligent."
13015023,13,15,23,And Berechiah and Elkanah `are' gatekeepers for the ark.
13015024,13,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, are blowing with trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah `are' gatekeepers for the ark."
13015025,13,15,25,"And it is David, and the elders of Israel, and the heads of the thousands, who are going to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom with joy;"
13015026,13,15,26,"and it cometh to pass, in God's helping the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrifice seven bullocks and seven rams."
13015027,13,15,27,"And David is wrapped in an upper robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who are bearing the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah head of the burden of the singers; and on David `is' an Ephod of linen."
13015028,13,15,28,"And all Israel are bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of a cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding with psalteries and harps,"
13015029,13,15,29,"and it cometh to pass, the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is entering in unto the city of David, and Michal daughter of Saul is looking through the window, and seeth king David dancing and playing, and despiseth him in her heart."
13016001,13,16,1,"And they bring in the ark of God, and set it up in the midst of the tent that David hath stretched out for it, and they bring near burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God;"
13016002,13,16,2,"and David ceaseth from offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the name of Jehovah,"
13016003,13,16,3,"and giveth a portion to every man of Israel, both man and woman: to each a cake of bread, and a measure of wine, and a grape-cake."
13016004,13,16,4,"And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah, of the Levites, ministers, even to make mention of, and to thank, and to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel,"
13016005,13,16,5,"Asaph the head, and his second Zechariah; Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of psalteries, and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals is sounding;"
13016006,13,16,6,and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests `are' with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
13016007,13,16,7,On that day then hath David given at the beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren: --
13016008,13,16,8,"Give thanks to Jehovah, call in His name, Make known among the peoples His doings."
13016009,13,16,9,"Sing ye to Him, sing psalms to Him, Meditate on all His wonders."
13016010,13,16,10,"Boast yourselves in His holy name, Rejoice doth the heart of those seeking Jehovah."
13016011,13,16,11,"Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek His face continually."
13016012,13,16,12,"Remember His wonders that He did, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth,"
13016013,13,16,13,"O seed of Israel, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!"
13016014,13,16,14,"He `is' Jehovah our God, In all the earth `are' His judgments."
13016015,13,16,15,"Remember ye to the age His covenant, The word He commanded -- To a thousand generations,"
13016016,13,16,16,"Which He hath made with Abraham, And His oath -- to Isaac,"
13016017,13,16,17,"And He establisheth it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel -- a covenant age-during."
13016018,13,16,18,"Saying: To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,"
13016019,13,16,19,"When ye are few of number, As a little thing, and sojourners in it."
13016020,13,16,20,"And they go up and down, From nation unto nation, And from a kingdom unto another people."
13016021,13,16,21,"He hath not suffered any to oppress them, And reproveth on their account kings:"
13016022,13,16,22,"Come not against Mine anointed ones, And against My prophets do not evil."
13016023,13,16,23,"Sing to Jehovah, all the earth, Proclaim from day unto day His salvation."
13016024,13,16,24,"Rehearse among nations His glory, Among all the peoples His wonders."
13016025,13,16,25,"For great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, And fearful He `is' above all gods."
13016026,13,16,26,"For all gods of the peoples `are' nought, And Jehovah the heavens hath made."
13016027,13,16,27,"Honour and majesty `are' before Him, Strength and joy `are' in His place."
13016028,13,16,28,"Ascribe to Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength."
13016029,13,16,29,"Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present, and come before Him. Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness."
13016030,13,16,30,"Be pained before Him, all the earth:"
13016031,13,16,31,"Also, established is the world, It is not moved! The heavens rejoice, and the earth is glad, And they say among nations: Jehovah hath reigned."
13016032,13,16,32,"Roar doth the sea, and its fulness, Exult doth the field, and all that `is' in it,"
13016033,13,16,33,"Then sing do trees of the forest, From the presence of Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth!"
13016034,13,16,34,"Give thanks to Jehovah, for good, For to the age, `is' His kindness,"
13016035,13,16,35,"And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To triumph in Thy praise."
13016036,13,16,36,"Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age and unto the age;' And all the people say, `Amen,' and have given praise to Jehovah."
13016037,13,16,37,"And he leaveth there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter of a day in its day,"
13016038,13,16,38,"both Obed-Edom and their brethren, sixty and eight, and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah for gatekeepers,"
13016039,13,16,39,"and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in a high place that `is' in Gibeon,"
13016040,13,16,40,"to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah, that He charged on Israel."
13016041,13,16,41,"And with them `are' Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen, who were defined by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age `is' His kindness,"
13016042,13,16,42,"and with them -- Heman and Jeduthun -- `are' trumpets and cymbals for those sounding, and instruments of the song of God, and the sons of Jeduthun `are' at the gate."
13016043,13,16,43,"And all the people go, each to his house, and David turneth round to bless his house."
13017001,13,17,1,"And it cometh to pass as David sat in his house, that David saith unto Nathan the prophet, `Lo, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah `is' under curtains;'"
13017002,13,17,2,"and Nathan saith unto David, `All that `is' in thy heart do, for God `is' with thee.'"
13017003,13,17,3,"And it cometh to pass on that night that a word of God is unto Nathan, saying,"
13017004,13,17,4,"`Go, and thou hast said unto David My servant, Thus said Jehovah, Thou dost not build for Me the house to dwell in:"
13017005,13,17,5,"for I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up Israel till this day, and I am from tent unto tent: and from the tabernacle,"
13017006,13,17,6,"whithersoever I have walked up and down among all Israel, a word spake I, with one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have ye not built for Me a house of cedars?"
13017007,13,17,7,"`And now, thus dost thou say to My servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, I have taken thee from the habitation, from after the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel,"
13017008,13,17,8,"and I am with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and I cut off all thine enemies from thy presence, and have made for thee a name like the name of the great ones who `are' in the earth."
13017009,13,17,9,"`And I have prepared a place for My people Israel, and planted it, and it hath dwelt in its place, and is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness add not to wear it out as at first,"
13017010,13,17,10,"yea, even from the days that I appointed judges over My people Israel. `And I have humbled all thine enemies, and I declare to thee that a house doth Jehovah build for thee,"
13017011,13,17,11,"and it hath come to pass, when thy days have been fulfilled to go with thy fathers, that I have raised up thy seed after thee, who is of thy sons, and I have established his kingdom,"
13017012,13,17,12,"he doth build for Me a house, and I have established his throne unto the age;"
13017013,13,17,13,"I am to him for a father, and he is to Me for a son, and My kindness I turn not aside from him as I turned it aside from him who was before thee,"
13017014,13,17,14,"and I have established him in My house, and in My kingdom unto the age, and his throne is established unto the age.'"
13017015,13,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan unto David."
13017016,13,17,16,"And David the king cometh in and sitteth before Jehovah, and saith, `Who `am' I, O Jehovah God, and what my house, that Thou hast brought me hitherto?"
13017017,13,17,17,"And this is small in Thine eyes, O God, and Thou speakest concerning the house of thy servant afar off, and hast seen me as a type of the man who is on high, O Jehovah God!"
13017018,13,17,18,`What doth David add more unto Thee for the honour of Thy servant; and Thou Thy servant hast known.
13017019,13,17,19,"O Jehovah, for Thy servant's sake, and according to Thine own heart Thou hast done all this greatness, to make known all these great things."
13017020,13,17,20,"O Jehovah, there is none like Thee, and there is no god save Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
13017021,13,17,21,"`And who `is' as Thy people Israel, one nation in the earth whom God hath gone to ransom to Him for a people, to make for Thee a name great and fearful, to cast out from the presence of Thy people whom Thou hast ransomed out of Egypt -- nations?"
13017022,13,17,22,"Yea, Thou dost appoint Thy people Israel to Thee for a people unto the age, and Thou, O Jehovah, hast been to them for God."
13017023,13,17,23,"`And now, O Jehovah, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, let be stedfast unto the age, and do as Thou hast spoken;"
13017024,13,17,24,"and let it be stedfast, and Thy name is great unto the age, saying, Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, is God to Israel, and the house of Thy servant David is established before Thee;"
13017025,13,17,25,"for Thou, O my God, Thou hast uncovered the ear of Thy servant -- to build to him a house, therefore hath Thy servant found to pray before Thee."
13017026,13,17,26,"`And now, Jehovah, Thou `art' God Himself, and Thou speakest concerning Thy servant this goodness;"
13017027,13,17,27,"and now, Thou hast been pleased to bless the house of Thy servant, to be to the age before Thee; for Thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed to the age.'"
13018001,13,18,1,"And it cometh to pass after this, that David smiteth the Philistines, and humbleth them, and taketh Gath and its small towns out of the hand of the Philistines;"
13018002,13,18,2,"and he smiteth Moab, and the Moabites are servants to David, bringing a present."
13018003,13,18,3,"And David smiteth Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, in his going to establish his power by the river Phrat,"
13018004,13,18,4,"and David captureth from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyeth utterly all the chariots, and leaveth of them a hundred chariots `only'."
13018005,13,18,5,"And Aram of Damascus cometh in to give help to Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth in Aram twenty and two thousand men,"
13018006,13,18,6,"and David putteth `garrisons' in Aram of Damascus, and the Aramaeans are to David for servants, bearing a present, and Jehovah giveth salvation to David whithersoever he hath gone."
13018007,13,18,7,"And David taketh the shields of gold that have been on the servants of Hadarezer, and bringeth them in to Jerusalem;"
13018008,13,18,8,"and from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, hath David taken very much brass; with it hath Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass."
13018009,13,18,9,"And Tou king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten the whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah,"
13018010,13,18,10,"and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask of him of peace, and to bless him (because that he hath fought against Hadarezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with Tou had Hadarezer been,) and all kinds of vessels, of gold, and silver, and brass;"
13018011,13,18,11,"also them hath king David sanctified to Jehovah with the silver and the gold that he hath taken from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek."
13018012,13,18,12,"And Abishai son of Zeruiah hath smitten Edom in the valley of salt -- eighteen thousand,"
13018013,13,18,13,"and he putteth in Edom garrisons, and all the Edomites are servants to David; and Jehovah saveth David whithersoever he hath gone."
13018014,13,18,14,"And David reigneth over all Israel, and he is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,"
13018015,13,18,15,"and Joab son of Zeruiah `is' over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud `is' remembrancer,"
13018016,13,18,16,"and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Abimelech son of Abiathar, `are' priests, and Shavsha `is' scribe,"
13018017,13,18,17,"and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is' over the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the elder sons of David `are' at the hand of the king."
13019001,13,19,1,"And it cometh to pass after this, that Nahash king of the sons of Ammon dieth, and his son reigneth in his stead,"
13019002,13,19,2,"and David saith, `I do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash, for his father did with me kindness;' and David sendeth messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David come in unto the land of the sons of Ammon, unto Hanun, to comfort him,"
13019003,13,19,3,"and the heads of the sons of Ammon say to Hanun, `Is David honouring thy father, in thine eyes, because he hath sent to thee comforters? in order to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out, the land, have not his servants come in unto thee?'"
13019004,13,19,4,"And Hanun taketh the servants of David, and shaveth them, and cutteth their long robes in the midst, unto the buttocks, and sendeth them away."
13019005,13,19,5,"And `some' go, and declare to David concerning the men, and he sendeth to meet them -- for the men have been greatly ashamed -- and the king saith, `Dwell in Jericho till that your beard is grown, then ye have returned.'"
13019006,13,19,6,"And the sons of Ammon see that they have made themselves abhorred by David, and Hanun and the sons of Ammon send a thousand talents of silver, to hire to them, from Aram-Naharaim, and from Aram-Maachah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen;"
13019007,13,19,7,"and they hire to them two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, and they come in and encamp before Medeba, and the sons of Ammon have been gathered out of their cities, and come in to the battle."
13019008,13,19,8,"And David heareth, and sendeth Joab, and all the host of the mighty men,"
13019009,13,19,9,"and the sons of Ammon come out and set battle in array at the opening of the city, and the kings who have come `are' by themselves in the field."
13019010,13,19,10,"And Joab seeth that the front of the battle hath been unto him, before and behind, and he chooseth out of all the choice in Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,"
13019011,13,19,11,"and the remnant of the people he hath given into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set in array to meet the sons of Ammon."
13019012,13,19,12,"And he saith, `If Aram be stronger than I, then thou hast been to me for salvation; and if the sons of Ammon be stronger than thou, then I have saved thee;"
13019013,13,19,13,"be strong, and we strengthen ourselves, for our people, and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah doth that which is good in His eyes.'"
13019014,13,19,14,"And Joab draweth nigh, and the people who `are' with him, before Aram to battle, and they flee from his face;"
13019015,13,19,15,"and the sons of Ammon have seen that Aram hath fled, and they flee -- they also -- from the face of Abishai his brother, and go in to the city. And Joab cometh in to Jerusalem."
13019016,13,19,16,"And Aram seeth that they have been smitten before Israel, and send messengers, and bring out Aram that `is' beyond the River, and Shophach head of the host of Hadarezer `is' before them."
13019017,13,19,17,"And it is declared to David, and he gathereth all Israel, and passeth over the Jordan, and cometh in unto them, and setteth in array against them; yea, David setteth in array the battle to meet Aram, and they fight with him;"
13019018,13,19,18,"and Aram fleeth from the face of Israel, and David slayeth of Aram seven thousand charioteers, and forty thousand footmen, and Shophach head of the host he hath put to death."
13019019,13,19,19,"And the servants of Hadarezer see that they have been smitten before Israel, and they make peace with David and serve him, and Aram hath not been willing to help the sons of Ammon any more."
13020001,13,20,1,"And it cometh to pass, at the time of the turn of the year -- at the time of the going out of the messengers -- that Joab leadeth out the force of the host, and destroyeth the land of the sons of Ammon, and cometh in and beseigeth Rabbah -- David is abiding in Jerusalem -- and Joab smiteth Rabbah, and breaketh it down."
13020002,13,20,2,"And David taketh the crown of their king from off his head, and findeth it `in' weight a talent of gold, and in it a precious stone, and it is on the head of David: and spoil of the city he hath brought out very much,"
13020003,13,20,3,"and the people who `are' in it he hath brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes; and thus doth David to all cities of the sons of Ammon, and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem."
13020004,13,20,4,"And it cometh to pass, after this, that there remaineth war in Gezer with the Philistines, then hath Sibbechai the Hushathite smitten Sippai, of the children of the giant, and they are humbled."
13020005,13,20,5,"And there is again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair smiteth Lahmi, brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear `is' like a beam of weavers."
13020006,13,20,6,"And there is again war in Gath, and there is a man of measure, and his fingers and his toes `are' six and six, twenty and four, and also, he hath been born to the giant."
13020007,13,20,7,"And he reproacheth Israel, and smite him doth Jonathan son of Shimea, brother of David."
13020008,13,20,8,"These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
13021001,13,21,1,"And there standeth up an adversary against Israel, and persuadeth David to number Israel,"
13021002,13,21,2,"And David saith unto Joab, and unto the heads of the people, `Go, number Israel from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, and bring unto me, and I know their number.'"
13021003,13,21,3,"And Joab saith, `Jehovah doth add to His people as they are a hundred times; are they not, my lord, O king, all of them to my lord for servants? why doth my lord seek this? why is he for a cause of guilt to Israel?'"
13021004,13,21,4,"And the word of the king `is' severe against Joab, and Joab goeth out, and goeth up and down in all Israel, and cometh in to Jerusalem."
13021005,13,21,5,"And Joab giveth the account of the numbering of the people unto David, and all Israel is a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand, each drawing sword, and Judah `is' four hundred and seventy thousand, each drawing sword."
13021006,13,21,6,"And Levi and Benjamin he hath not numbered in their midst, for the word of the king was abominable with Joab."
13021007,13,21,7,"And it is evil in the eyes of God concerning this thing, and He smiteth Israel,"
13021008,13,21,8,"and David saith unto God, `I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing; and now, cause to pass away, I pray Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have acted very foolishly.'"
13021009,13,21,9,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Gad, seer of David, saying:"
13021010,13,21,10,"`Go, and thou hast spoken unto David, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Three -- I am stretching out unto thee; choose for thee one of these, and I do `it' to thee.'"
13021011,13,21,11,"And Gad cometh in unto David, and saith to him, `Thus said Jehovah, Take for thee --"
13021012,13,21,12,"either for three years -- famine, or three months to be consumed from the face of thine adversaries, even the sword of thine enemies to overtake, or three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and a messenger of Jehovah destroying in all the border of Israel; and now, see; what word do I return to Him who is sending me?'"
13021013,13,21,13,"And David saith unto Gad, `I am greatly distressed, let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for very many `are' His mercies, and into the hand of man let me not fall.'"
13021014,13,21,14,"And Jehovah giveth a pestilence in Israel, and there fall of Israel seventy thousand men,"
13021015,13,21,15,"and God sendeth a messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it, and as he is destroying Jehovah hath seen, and is comforted concerning the evil, and saith to the messenger who `is' destroying, `Enough, now, cease thy hand.' And the messenger of Jehovah is standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,"
13021016,13,21,16,"and David lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem, and David falleth, and the elders, covered with sackcloth, on their faces."
13021017,13,21,17,"And David saith unto God, `Did not I -- I say to number the people? Yea, I it `is' who have sinned, and done great evil: and these, the flock, what did they? O Jehovah, my God, let, I pray Thee, Thy hand be on me, and on the house of my father, and not on Thy people -- to be plagued.'"
13021018,13,21,18,"And the messenger of Jehovah spake unto Gad, saying for David, `Surely David doth go up to raise an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.'"
13021019,13,21,19,"And David goeth up by the word of Gad, that he spake in the name of Jehovah."
13021020,13,21,20,"And Ornan turneth back, and seeth the messenger, and his four sons `are' with him, hiding themselves, and Ornan is threshing wheat."
13021021,13,21,21,"And David cometh in unto Ornan, and Ornan looketh attentively, and seeth David, and goeth out from the threshing-floor, and boweth himself to David -- face to the earth."
13021022,13,21,22,"And David saith unto Ornan, `Give to me the place of the threshing-floor, and I build in it an altar to Jehovah; for full silver give it to me, and the plague is restrained from the people.'"

13029005,13,29,5,"even gold for `things of' gold, and silver for `those of' silver, and for all the work by the hand of artificers; and who `is' he that is offering willingly to consecrate his hand to-day to Jehovah?'"
13029006,13,29,6,"And the heads of the fathers, and the heads of the tribes of Israel, and the heads of the thousands, and of the hundreds, even to the heads of the work of the king, offer willingly."
13029007,13,29,7,"And they give for the service of the house of God, of gold -- talents five thousand, and drams a myriad; and of silver -- talents ten thousand, and of brass -- a myriad and eight thousand talents; and of iron -- a hundred thousand talents;"
13029008,13,29,8,"and he with whom stones are found hath given to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite."
13029009,13,29,9,"And the people rejoice because of their offering willingly, for with a perfect heart they have offered willingly to Jehovah; and also David the king hath rejoiced -- great joy."
13029010,13,29,10,"And David blesseth Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly, and David saith, `Blessed `art' Thou, Jehovah, God of Israel our father, from age even unto age."
13029011,13,29,11,"To Thee, O Jehovah, `is' the greatness, and the might, and the beauty, and the victory, and the honour, because of all in the heavens and in the earth; to Thee, O Jehovah, `is' the kingdom, and he who is lifting up himself over all for head;"
13029012,13,29,12,"and the riches, and the honour `are' from before Thee, and Thou art ruling over all, and in Thy hand `is' power and might, and in Thy hand, to make great, and to give strength to all."
13029013,13,29,13,"`And now, our God, we are giving thanks to Thee, and giving praise to Thy beauteous name;"
13029014,13,29,14,"yea, because, who `am' I, and who `are' my people, that we retain power to offer thus willingly? but of Thee `is' the whole, and out of Thy hand we have given to Thee;"
13029015,13,29,15,"for sojourners we `are' before Thee, and settlers, like all our fathers; as a shadow `are' our days on the land, and there is none abiding."
13029016,13,29,16,"`O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build to Thee a house, for Thy holy name, `is' out of Thy hand, and of Thee `is' the whole."
13029017,13,29,17,"`And I have known, my God, that Thou art trying the heart, and uprightness dost desire; I, in the uprightness of my heart, have willingly offered all these: and now, Thy people who are found here I have seen with joy to offer willingly to Thee."
13029018,13,29,18,"`O Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this to the age for the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and prepare their heart unto Thee;"
13029019,13,29,19,"and to Solomon my son give a perfect heart, to keep Thy commands, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do the whole, even to build the palace `for' which I have prepared.'"
13029020,13,29,20,"And David saith to all the assembly, `Bless, I pray you, Jehovah your God;' and all the assembly bless Jehovah, God of their fathers, and bow and do obeisance to Jehovah, and to the king."
13029021,13,29,21,"And they sacrifice to Jehovah sacrifices, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the morrow of that day, bullocks a thousand, rams a thousand, lambs a thousand, and their oblations, even sacrifices in abundance, for all Israel."
13029022,13,29,22,"And they eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great joy, and cause Solomon son of David to reign a second time, and anoint `him' before Jehovah for leader, and Zadok for priest."
13029023,13,29,23,"And Solomon sitteth on the throne of Jehovah for king instead of David his father, and prospereth, and all Israel hearken unto him,"
13029024,13,29,24,"and all the heads, and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David have given a hand under Solomon the king;"
13029025,13,29,25,"and Jehovah maketh Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel, and putteth upon him the honour of the kingdom that hath not been on any king over Israel before him."
13029026,13,29,26,"And David son of Jesse hath reigned over all Israel,"
13029027,13,29,27,"and the days that he hath reigned over Israel `are' forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three;"
13029028,13,29,28,"and he dieth in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches, and honour, and reign doth Solomon his son in his stead."
13029029,13,29,29,"And the matters of David the king, the first and the last, lo, they are written beside the matters of Samuel the seer, and beside the matters of Nathan the prophet, and beside the matters of Gad the seer,"
13029030,13,29,30,"with all his reign, and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all kingdoms of the lands."
14001001,14,1,1,"And strengthen himself doth Solomon son of David over his kingdom, and Jehovah his God `is' with him, and maketh him exceedingly great."
14001002,14,1,2,"And Solomon saith to all Israel, to heads of the thousands, and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honourable one of all Israel, heads of the fathers,"
14001003,14,1,3,"and they go -- Solomon, and all the assembly with him -- to the high place that `is' in Gibeon, for there hath been God's tent of meeting, that Moses, servant of Jehovah, made in the wilderness,"
14001004,14,1,4,"but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim, when David prepared for it, for he stretched out for it a tent in Jerusalem;"
14001005,14,1,5,"and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the assembly seek to it."
14001006,14,1,6,"And Solomon goeth up thither, on the altar of brass, before Jehovah, that `is' at the tent of meeting, and causeth to ascend upon it a thousand burnt-offerings."
14001007,14,1,7,"In that night hath God appeared to Solomon, and saith to him, `Ask -- what do I give to thee?'"
14001008,14,1,8,"And Solomon saith to God, `Thou hast done with David my father great kindness, and hast caused me to reign in his stead."
14001009,14,1,9,"Now, O Jehovah God, is Thy word with David my father stedfast, for Thou hast caused me to reign over a people numerous as the dust of the earth;"
14001010,14,1,10,"now, wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I go out before this people, and I come in, for who doth judge this Thy great people?'"
14001011,14,1,11,"And God saith to Solomon, `Because that this hath been with thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, and honour, and the life of those hating thee, and also many days hast not asked, and dost ask for thyself wisdom and knowledge, so that thou dost judge My people over which I have caused thee to reign --"
14001012,14,1,12,"the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee, and riches and wealth and honour I give to thee, that there hath not been so to the kings who `are' before thee, and after thee it is not so.'"
14001013,14,1,13,"And Solomon cometh in `from' the high place that `is' in Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigneth over Israel,"
14001014,14,1,14,"and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen, and he hath a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem."
14001015,14,1,15,"And the king maketh the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he made as sycamores that `are' in the low country, for abundance."
14001016,14,1,16,"And the source of the horses that `are' to Solomon `is' from Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a price,"
14001017,14,1,17,"and they come up, and bring out from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram -- by their hand they bring out."
14002001,14,2,1,"And Solomon saith to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom,"
14002002,14,2,2,"and Solomon numbereth seventy thousand men bearing burden, and eighty thousand men hewing in the mountain, and overseers over them -- three thousand and six hundred."
14002003,14,2,3,"And Solomon sendeth unto Huram king of Tyre, saying, `When thou hast dealt with David my father, then thou dost send to him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in;"
14002004,14,2,4,"lo, I am building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to sanctify `it' to Him, to make perfume before Him, perfume of spices, and a continual arrangement, and burnt-offerings at morning and at evening, at sabbaths, and at new moons, and at appointed seasons of Jehovah our God; to the age this `is' on Israel."
14002005,14,2,5,"`And the house that I am building `is' great, for greater `is' our God than all gods;"
14002006,14,2,6,"and who doth retain strength to build to Him a house, for the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Him? and who `am' I that I do build to Him a house, except to make perfume before Him?"
14002007,14,2,7,"`And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and knowing to grave gravings with the wise men who `are' with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father prepared;"
14002008,14,2,8,"and send to me cedar-trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon, for I have known that thy servants know to cut down trees of Lebanon, and lo, my servants `are' with thy servants,"
14002009,14,2,9,"even to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house that I am building `is' great and wonderful."
14002010,14,2,10,"`And lo, to hewers, to those cutting the trees, I have given beaten wheat to thy servants, cors twenty thousand, and barley, cors twenty thousand, and wine, baths twenty thousand, and oil, baths twenty thousand.'"
14002011,14,2,11,"And Huram king of Tyre saith in writing, and sendeth unto Solomon: `In the love of Jehovah to His people He hath given thee king over them.'"
14002012,14,2,12,"And Huram saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, who doth build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom."
14002013,14,2,13,"`And now, I have sent a wise man having understanding, of Huram my father,"
14002014,14,2,14,"(son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre), knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave any graving, and to devise any device that is given to him, with thy wise men, and the wise men of my lord David thy father."
14002015,14,2,15,"`And, now, the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants,"
14002016,14,2,16,"and we -- we cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all thy need, and bring them in to thee -- floats by sea, to Joppa, and thou dost take them up to Jerusalem.'"
14002017,14,2,17,"And Solomon numbereth all the men, the sojourners who `are' in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them, and they are found a hundred and fifty thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred;"
14002018,14,2,18,"and he maketh of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers, to cause the people to work."
14003001,14,3,1,"And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Jehovah, in Jerusalem, in the mount of Moriah, where He appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,"
14003002,14,3,2,"and he beginneth to build in the second `day', in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
14003003,14,3,3,"And `in' these hath Solomon been instructed to build the house of God: The length `in' cubits by the former measure `is' sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
14003004,14,3,4,"As to the porch that `is' on the front, the length `is' by the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty, and he overlayeth it within with pure gold."
14003005,14,3,5,"And the large house he hath covered with fir-trees, and he doth cover it with good gold, and causeth to ascend on it palms and chains,"
14003006,14,3,6,"and he overlayeth the house with precious stone for beauty, and the gold `is' gold of Parvaim,"
14003007,14,3,7,"and he covereth the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold, and hath graved cherubs on the walls."
14003008,14,3,8,"And he maketh the most holy house: its length `is' by the front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and he covereth it with good gold, to six hundred talents;"
14003009,14,3,9,"and the weight of the nails `is' fifty shekels of gold, and the upper chambers he hath covered with gold."
14003010,14,3,10,"And he maketh in the most holy house two cherubs, image work, and he overlayeth them with gold;"
14003011,14,3,11,"as to the wings of the cherubs, their length `is' twenty cubits, the wing of the one `is' five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing `is' five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub."
14003012,14,3,12,"And the wing of the other cherub `is' five cubits touching the wall of the house, and the other wing `is' five cubits, adhering to the wing of the other cherub."
14003013,14,3,13,"The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty cubits, and they are standing on their feet and their faces `are' inward."
14003014,14,3,14,"And he maketh the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and causeth cherubs to go up on it."
14003015,14,3,15,"And he maketh at the front of the house two pillars, thirty and five cubits in length, and the ornament that `is' on their heads five cubits."
14003016,14,3,16,"And he maketh chains in the oracle, and putteth on the heads of the pillars, and maketh a hundred pomegranates, and putteth on the chains."
14003017,14,3,17,"And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple, one on the right, and one on the left, and calleth the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
14004001,14,4,1,"And he maketh an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height."
14004002,14,4,2,"And he maketh the molten sea; ten by the cubit, from its edge unto its edge, round in compass, and five by the cubit its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it, round about."
14004003,14,4,3,"And the likeness of oxen `is' under it, all round about encompassing it, ten in the cubit, compassing the sea round about; two rows of oxen are cast in its being cast."
14004004,14,4,4,"It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea `is' upon them above, and all their hinder parts `are' within."
14004005,14,4,5,"And its thickness `is' a handbreadth, and its lip as the work of the lip of a cup flowered with lilies; taking hold -- baths three thousand it containeth."
14004006,14,4,6,"And he maketh ten lavers, and putteth five on the right, and five on the left, to wash with them; the work of the burnt-offering they purge with them; and the sea `is' for priests to wash with."
14004007,14,4,7,"And he maketh the ten candlesticks of gold, according to their ordinance, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left."
14004008,14,4,8,"And he maketh ten tables, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left; and he maketh bowls of gold a hundred."
14004009,14,4,9,"And he maketh the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and their doors he hath overlaid with brass."
14004010,14,4,10,"And the sea he hath placed on the right shoulder eastward, over-against the south."
14004011,14,4,11,"And Huram maketh the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls, and Huram finisheth to make the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God;"
14004012,14,4,12,"two pillars, and the bowls, and the crowns on the heads of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of the crowns that `are' on the heads of the pillars;"
14004013,14,4,13,"and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths, two rows of pomegranates to the one wreath, to cover the two bowls of the crowns that `are' on the front of the pillars."
14004014,14,4,14,And the bases he hath made; and the lavers he hath made on the bases;
14004015,14,4,15,"the one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,"
14004016,14,4,16,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their vessels, hath Huram his father made for king Solomon, for the house of Jehovah, of brass purified."
14004017,14,4,17,"In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah."
14004018,14,4,18,"And Solomon maketh all these vessels in great abundance, that the weight of the brass hath not been searched out."
14004019,14,4,19,"And Solomon maketh all the vessels that `are for' the house of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and on them `is' bread of the presence;"
14004020,14,4,20,"and the candlesticks, and their lamps, for their burning according to the ordinance, before the oracle, of gold refined;"
14004021,14,4,21,"and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold -- it `is' the perfection of gold;"
14004022,14,4,22,"and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of gold refined, and the opening of the house, its innermost doors to the holy of holies, and the doors of the house to the temple, of gold."
14005001,14,5,1,"And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah is finished, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of David his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he hath put among the treasures of the house of God."
14005002,14,5,2,"Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David -- it `is' Zion."
14005003,14,5,3,And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the feast -- it `is' the seventh month;
14005004,14,5,4,"and all the elders of Israel come in, and the Levites lift up the ark,"
14005005,14,5,5,"and they bring up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the vessels of the sanctuary that `are' in the tent; brought them up have the priests, the Levites;"
14005006,14,5,6,"and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered from multitude."
14005007,14,5,7,"And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;"
14005008,14,5,8,"and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves, from above;"
14005009,14,5,9,"and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen out of the ark on the front of the oracle, and they are not seen without; and it is there unto this day."
14005010,14,5,10,"There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses gave in Horeb, where Jehovah covenanted with the sons of Israel, in their going out from Egypt."
14005011,14,5,11,"And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from the sanctuary -- for all the priests who are present have sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by courses,"
14005012,14,5,12,"and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren, clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them priests, to a hundred and twenty, blowing with trumpets --"
14005013,14,5,13,"yea, it cometh to pass, as one `are' trumpeters and singers, to sound -- one voice -- to praise and to give thanks to Jehovah, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving praise to Jehovah, for good, for to the age `is' His kindness, that the house is filled with a cloud -- the house of Jehovah,"
14005014,14,5,14,"and the priests have not been able to stand to minister from the presence of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of God."
14006001,14,6,1,"Then said Solomon, `Jehovah said -- to dwell in thick darkness,"
14006002,14,6,2,"and I -- I have built a house of habitation for Thee, and a fixed place for Thy dwelling to the ages.'"
14006003,14,6,3,"And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole assembly of Israel, and the whole assembly of Israel is standing,"
14006004,14,6,4,"and he saith, `Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath spoken with His mouth with David my father, and with His hands hath fulfilled `it', saying:"
14006005,14,6,5,"`From the day that I brought out My people from the land of Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of any of the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name being there, and I have not fixed on a man to be leader over My people Israel;"
14006006,14,6,6,"and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there, and I fix on David to be over My people Israel."
14006007,14,6,7,"`And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah God of Israel,"
14006008,14,6,8,"and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast done well that it hath been with thy heart,"
14006009,14,6,9,"but thou dost not build the house, for thy son who cometh forth out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name."
14006010,14,6,10,"`And Jehovah doth establish His word that He spake, and I rise up in the stead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and I build the house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,"
14006011,14,6,11,"and I place there the ark, where `is' the covenant of Jehovah that He made with the sons of Israel.'"
14006012,14,6,12,"And he standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth out his hand, --"
14006013,14,6,13,"for Solomon hath made a scaffold of brass, and putteth it in the midst of the court, five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height, and he standeth upon it, and kneeleth on his knees over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth forth his hands towards the heavens --"
14006014,14,6,14,"and saith, `O Jehovah God of Israel, there is not like Thee a god in the heavens and in the earth, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Thy servants who are walking before Thee with all their heart;"
14006015,14,6,15,"who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst speak to him; yea, Thou dost speak with Thy mouth, and with Thy hand hast fulfilled `it', as at this day."
14006016,14,6,16,"`And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst speak to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel, only, if thy sons watch their way to walk in My law, as thou hast walked before Me."
14006017,14,6,17,"`And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, is Thy word stedfast that Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, to David,"
14006018,14,6,18,"(for is it true? -- God dwelleth with man on the earth! Lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Thee, how much less this house that I have built?)"
14006019,14,6,19,"`And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer that Thy servant is praying before Thee,"
14006020,14,6,20,"for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by night, towards the place that Thou hast said to put Thy name there, to hearken unto the prayer that Thy servant prayeth towards this place."
14006021,14,6,21,"`And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, that they pray towards this place, and Thou dost hear from the place of Thy dwelling, from the heavens, and hast hearkened, and forgiven."
14006022,14,6,22,"`If a man doth sin against his neighbour, and he hath lifted up on him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath hath come in before Thine altar in this house --"
14006023,14,6,23,"then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Thy servants, to give back to the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness."
14006024,14,6,24,"`And if Thy people Israel is smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back and confessed Thy name, and prayed and made supplication before Thee in this house --"
14006025,14,6,25,"then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy people Israel, and caused them to turn back unto the ground that Thou hast given to them, and to their fathers."
14006026,14,6,26,"`In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Thy name -- from their sin they turn back because Thou dost afflict them --"
14006027,14,6,27,"then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, because Thou directest them unto the good way in which they walk, and hast given rain on Thy land that Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance."
14006028,14,6,28,"`Famine, when it is in the land, pestilence, when it is, blasting, and mildew, locust, and caterpillar, when they are, when its enemies have distressed it in the land -- its gates, any plague and any sickness;"
14006029,14,6,29,"any prayer, any supplication that is for any man, and for all Thy people Israel, when they know each his own plague, and his own pain, and he hath spread out his hands towards this house:"
14006030,14,6,30,"then Thou dost hear from the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast given to each according to all his ways (because Thou knowest his heart, for Thou -- Thou only -- hast known the heart of the sons of men),"
14006031,14,6,31,"so that they fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers."
14006032,14,6,32,"`And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and he hath come from a land afar off for the sake of Thy great name, and Thy strong hand, and Thy stretched-out arm, and they have come in and prayed towards this house:"
14006033,14,6,33,"then Thou dost hear from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for: so that all the peoples of the earth do know Thy name, so as to fear Thee, as Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name is called on this house that I have built."
14006034,14,6,34,"`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemies in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto Thee the way of this city that Thou hast fixed on, and the house that I have built for Thy name:"
14006035,14,6,35,"then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause."
14006036,14,6,36,"`When they sin against Thee -- for there is not a man who sinneth not -- and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them before an enemy, and taken them captive have their captors, unto a land far off or near;"
14006037,14,6,37,"and they have turned `it' back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have done wickedly;"
14006038,14,6,38,"yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built for Thy name:"
14006039,14,6,39,"then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee."
14006040,14,6,40,"`Now, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and Thine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place:"
14006041,14,6,41,"and now, rise, O Jehovah God, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength; Thy priests, O Jehovah God, are clothed with salvation, and Thy saints rejoice in the goodness,"
14006042,14,6,42,"O Jehovah God, turn not back the face of Thine anointed, be mindful of the kind acts of David Thy servant.'"
14007001,14,7,1,"And at Solomon's finishing to pray, then the fire hath come down from the heavens, and consumeth the burnt-offering and the sacrifices, and the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house,"
14007002,14,7,2,"and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house of Jehovah, because the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of Jehovah."
14007003,14,7,3,"And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of the fire, and the honour of Jehovah on the house, and they bow -- faces to the earth -- on the pavement, and do obeisance, and give thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age `is' His kindness."
14007004,14,7,4,"And the king and all the people are sacrificing a sacrifice before Jehovah,"
14007005,14,7,5,"and king Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of the herd, twenty and two thousand, and of the flock, a hundred and twenty thousand, and the king and all the people dedicate the house of God."
14007006,14,7,6,"And the priests over their charges are standing, and the Levites with instruments of the song of Jehovah -- that David the king made, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age `is' His kindness, in David's praising by their hand -- and the priests are blowing trumpets over-against them, and all Israel are standing."
14007007,14,7,7,"And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that `is' before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the altar of brass that Solomon made hath not been able to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat."
14007008,14,7,8,"And solomon maketh the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him -- a very great assembly -- from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt."
14007009,14,7,9,"And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the feast seven days."
14007010,14,7,10,"And on the twenty and third day of the seventh month he hath sent the people to their tents, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for the goodness that Jehovah hath done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people."
14007011,14,7,11,"And Solomon finisheth the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king; and all that hath come on the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he hath caused to prosper."
14007012,14,7,12,"And Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon by night, and saith to him, `I have heard thy prayer, and have fixed on this place to Me for a house of sacrifice."
14007013,14,7,13,"If I restrain the heavens and there is no rain, and if I lay charge on the locust to consume the land, and if I send pestilence among My people --"
14007014,14,7,14,"and My people on whom My name is called be humbled, and pray, and seek My face, and turn back from their evil ways, then I -- I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and heal their land."
14007015,14,7,15,"`Now, Mine eyes are open, and Mine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place;"
14007016,14,7,16,"and now, I have chosen and sanctified this house for My name being there unto the age; yea, Mine eyes and My heart have been there all the days."
14007017,14,7,17,"`And thou, if thou dost walk before Me as David thy father walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and My statutes and My judgments dost keep --"
14007018,14,7,18,"then I have established the throne of thy kingdom, as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There is not cut off a man to thee -- a ruler in Israel;"
14007019,14,7,19,"and if ye turn back -- ye -- and have forsaken My statutes, and My commands, that I have placed before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them -- then I have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them,"
14007020,14,7,20,"and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a byword, among all the peoples."
14007021,14,7,21,"`And this house that hath been high, to every one passing by it, is an astonishment, and he hath said, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?"
14007022,14,7,22,"and they have said, Because that they have forsaken Jehovah, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves to them, and serve them, therefore He hath brought upon them all this evil.'"
14008001,14,8,1,"And it cometh to pass, at the end of twenty years, that Solomon hath built the house of Jehovah, and his own house."
14008002,14,8,2,"As to the cities that Huram hath given to Solomon, Solomon hath built them, and there he causeth the sons of Israel to dwell."
14008003,14,8,3,"And Solomon goeth to Hamath-Zobah, and layeth hold upon it;"
14008004,14,8,4,"and he buildeth Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the cities of store that he hath built in Hamath."
14008005,14,8,5,"And he buildeth Beth-Horon the upper, and Beth-Horon the lower -- cities of defence, with walls, two-leaved doors, and bar --"
14008006,14,8,6,"and Baalath, and all the cities of store that Solomon had, and all the cities of the chariot, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
14008007,14,8,7,"All the people who are left of the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are not of Israel --"
14008008,14,8,8,"of their sons who have been left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel consumed not -- doth Solomon lift up a tribute unto this day."
14008009,14,8,9,"And none of the sons of Israel hath Solomon made servants for his work, but they `are' men of war, and heads of his captains, and heads of his charioteers, and of his horsemen;"
14008010,14,8,10,"and these `are' heads of the officers whom king Solomon hath, two hundred and fifty who are rulers among the people."
14008011,14,8,11,"And the daughter of Pharaoh hath Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he said, `My wife doth not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for they are holy unto whom hath come the ark of Jehovah.'"
14008012,14,8,12,"Then hath Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he built before the porch,"
14008013,14,8,13,"even by the matter of a day in its day, to cause to ascend according to the command of Moses, on sabbaths, and on new moons, and on appointed seasons, three times in a year -- in the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths."
14008014,14,8,14,"And he establisheth, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests over their service, and of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister over-against the priests, according to the matter of a day in its day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at gate and gate, for so `is' the command of David the man of God."
14008015,14,8,15,"And they have not turned aside `from' the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites, in reference to any matter, and to the treasures."
14008016,14,8,16,"And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and till its completion; perfect is the house of Jehovah."
14008017,14,8,17,"Then hath Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber, and unto Elath, on the border of the sea, in the land of Edom;"
14008018,14,8,18,"and Huram sendeth to him, by the hand of his servants, ships and servants knowing the sea, and they go with servants of Solomon to Ophir, and take thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and bring in unto king Solomon."
14009001,14,9,1,"And the queen of Sheba hath heard of the fame of Solomon, and cometh in to try Solomon with acute sayings, to Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels bearing spices and gold in abundance, and precious stone; and she cometh in unto Solomon, and speaketh with him all that hath been with her heart,"
14009002,14,9,2,"and Solomon declareth to her all her matters, and there hath not been hid a thing from Solomon that he hath not declared to her."
14009003,14,9,3,"And the queen of Sheba seeth the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he hath built,"
14009004,14,9,4,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his stewards, and their clothing, an his burnt-offering that he offered up in the house of Jehovah, and there hath not been any more spirit in her."
14009005,14,9,5,"And she saith unto the king, `True `is' the word that I heard in my land concerning thy matters and concerning thy wisdom,"
14009006,14,9,6,"and I have given no credence to their words, till that I have come, and mine eyes see, and lo, there hath not been declared to me the half of the abundance of thy wisdom -- thou hast added unto the report that I heard."
14009007,14,9,7,"`O the happiness of thy men, and the happiness of thy servants -- these -- who are standing before thee continually, and hearing thy wisdom."
14009008,14,9,8,"Let Jehovah thy God be blessed who hath delighted in thee, to put thee on His throne for king for Jehovah thy God; in the love of thy God to Israel, to establish it to the age, He hath put thee over them for king, to do judgment and righteousness.'"
14009009,14,9,9,"And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stone; and there hath not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba hath given to king Solomon."
14009010,14,9,10,"And also, servants of Huram, and servants of Solomon, who brought in gold from Ophir, have brought in algum-trees and precious stone."
14009011,14,9,11,"And the king maketh the algum-trees staircases for the house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and psalteries for singers; and there have been none seen like these before in the land of Judah."
14009012,14,9,12,"And king Solomon hath given to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which she had brought unto the king, and she turneth and goeth to her land, she and her servants."
14009013,14,9,13,"And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,"
14009014,14,9,14,"apart from `what' the tourists, and the merchants, are bringing in; and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land, are bringing in gold and silver to Solomon."
14009015,14,9,15,"And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold, six hundred `shekels' of alloyed gold he causeth to go up on the one target;"
14009016,14,9,16,"and three hundred shields of alloyed gold, three hundred `shekels' of gold he causeth to go up on the one shield, and the king putteth them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
14009017,14,9,17,"And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and overlayeth it with pure gold;"
14009018,14,9,18,"and six steps `are' to the throne, and a footstool of gold, to the throne they are fastened, and hands `are' on this `side' and on that on the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,"
14009019,14,9,19,"and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps on this `side', and on that: it hath not been made so for any kingdom."
14009020,14,9,20,"And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon `are' of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon `are' of refined gold -- silver is not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything;"
14009021,14,9,21,"for ships of the king are going to Tarshish, with servants of Huram: once in three years come do the ships of Tarshish bearing gold, and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks."
14009022,14,9,22,And king Solomon becometh greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom;
14009023,14,9,23,"and all the kings of the earth are seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God hath put in his heart,"
14009024,14,9,24,"and they are bringing in each his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
14009025,14,9,25,"And there are to Solomon four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem."
14009026,14,9,26,"And he is ruling over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt."
14009027,14,9,27,"And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he hath made as sycamores, that `are' in the low country, for abundance,"
14009028,14,9,28,"and they are bringing out horses from Egypt to Solomon, and from all the lands."
14009029,14,9,29,"And the rest of the matters of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written beside the matters of Nathan the prophet, and beside the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and with the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?"
14009030,14,9,30,"And Solomon reigneth in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years,"
14009031,14,9,31,"and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David his father, and reign doth Rehoboam his son in his stead."
14010001,14,10,1,"And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for `to' Shechem have all Israel come to cause him to reign."
14010002,14,10,2,"And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's -- who `is' in Egypt because he hath fled from the face of Solomon the king -- hearing, that Jeroboam turneth back out of Egypt;"
14010003,14,10,3,"and they send and call for him, and Jeroboam cometh in, and all Israel, and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,"
14010004,14,10,4,"`Thy father made our yoke sharp, and now, make light `somewhat' of the sharp service of thy father, and of his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.'"
14010005,14,10,5,"And he saith unto them, `Yet three days -- then return ye unto me;' and the people go."
14010006,14,10,6,"And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, `How are ye counselling to answer this people?'"
14010007,14,10,7,"And they speak unto him, saying, `If thou dost become good to this people, and hast been pleased with them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.'"
14010008,14,10,8,"And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, those standing before him,"
14010009,14,10,9,"and he saith unto them, `What are ye counselling, and we answer this people that have spoken unto me, saying, Make light `somewhat' of the yoke that thy father put upon us?'"
14010010,14,10,10,"And the lads who have grown up with him, speak with him, saying, `Thus dost thou say to the people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and thou, make light `somewhat' of our yoke; thus dost thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father;"
14010011,14,10,11,"and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I -- I add unto your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I -- with scorpions.'"
14010012,14,10,12,"And Jeroboam cometh in, and all the people, unto Rehoboam on the third day, as the king spake, saying, `Return unto me on the third day.'"
14010013,14,10,13,"And the king answereth them sharply, and king Rehoboam forsaketh the counsel of the aged men,"
14010014,14,10,14,"and speaketh unto them according to the counsel of the lads, saying, `My father made your yoke heavy, and I -- I add unto it; my father chastised you with whips, and I -- with scorpions.'"
14010015,14,10,15,"And the king hath not hearkened unto the people, for the revolution hath been from God, for the sake of Jehovah's establishing His word that He spake by the hand of Abijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat."
14010016,14,10,16,"And all Israel have seen that the king hath not hearkened to them, and the people send back `to' the king, saying, `What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in a son of Jesse; each to thy tents, O Israel; now, see thy house -- David,' and all Israel go to their tents."
14010017,14,10,17,As to the sons of Israel who are dwelling in the cities of Judah -- Rehoboam reigneth over them.
14010018,14,10,18,"And king Rehoboam sendeth Hadoram, who `is' over the tribute, and the sons of Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam hath strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;"
14010019,14,10,19,and Israel transgress against the house of David unto this day.
14011001,14,11,1,"And Rehoboam cometh in to Jerusalem, and assembleth the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight with Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam."
14011002,14,11,2,"And a word of Jehovah is unto Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,"
14011003,14,11,3,"`Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
14011004,14,11,4,"Thus said Jehovah, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren, turn back each to his house, for from Me hath this thing been;' and they hear the words of Jehovah, and turn back from going against Jeroboam."
14011005,14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelleth in Jerusalem, and buildeth cities for a bulwark in Judah,"
14011006,14,11,6,"yea, he buildeth Beth-Lehem and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14011007,14,11,7,"and Beth-Zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,"
14011008,14,11,8,"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14011009,14,11,9,"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14011010,14,11,10,"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, that `are' in Judah and in Benjamin, cities of bulwarks."
14011011,14,11,11,"And he strengtheneth the bulwarks, and putteth in them leaders, and treasures of food, and oil, and wine,"
14011012,14,11,12,"and in every city and city targets and spears, and strengtheneth them very greatly; and he hath Judah and Benjamin."
14011013,14,11,13,"And the priests, and the Levites, that `are' in all Israel, have stationed themselves by him, out of all their border,"
14011014,14,11,14,"for the Levites have left their suburbs and their possession, and they come to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons have cast them off from acting as priests to Jehovah,"
14011015,14,11,15,"and he establisheth to him priests for high places, and for goats, and for calves, that he made --"
14011016,14,11,16,"and after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those giving their heart to seek Jehovah, God of Israel, have come in to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah, God of their father."
14011017,14,11,17,"And they strengthen the kingdom of Judah, and strengthen Rehoboam son of Solomon, for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years."
14011018,14,11,18,"And Rehoboam taketh to him a wife, Mahalath, child of Jerimoth son of David, `and' Abigail daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse."
14011019,14,11,19,"And she beareth to him sons, Jeush, and Shamaria, and Zaham."
14011020,14,11,20,"And after her he hath taken Maachah daughter of Absalom, and she beareth to him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14011021,14,11,21,"And Rehoboam loveth Maachah daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines -- for eighteen wives he hath taken, and sixty concubines -- and he begetteth twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters."
14011022,14,11,22,"And Rehoboam appointeth for head Abijah son of Maachah, for leader among his brethren, for to cause him to reign."
14011023,14,11,23,"And he hath understanding, and spreadeth out of all his sons to all lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all cities of the bulwarks, and giveth to them provision in abundance; and he asketh a multitude of wives."
14012001,14,12,1,"And it cometh to pass, at the establishing of the kingdom of Rehoboam, and at his strengthening himself, he hath forsaken the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him."
14012002,14,12,2,"And it cometh to pass, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, come up hath Shishak king of Egypt against Jerusalem -- because they trespassed against Jehovah --"
14012003,14,12,3,"with a thousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty thousand horsemen, and there is no number to the people who have come with him out of Egypt -- Lubim, Sukkiim, and Cushim --"
14012004,14,12,4,"and he captureth the cities of the bulwarks that `are' to Judah, and cometh in unto Jerusalem."
14012005,14,12,5,"And Shemaiah the prophet hath come in unto Rehoboam and the heads of Judah who have been gathered unto Jerusalem from the presence of Shishak, and saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, Ye have forsaken Me, and also, I have left you in the hand of Shishak;'"
14012006,14,12,6,"and the heads of Israel are humbled, and the king, and they say, `Righteous `is' Jehovah.'"
14012007,14,12,7,"And when Jehovah seeth that they have been humbled, a word of Jehovah hath been unto Shemaiah, saying, `They have been humbled; I do not destroy them, and I have given to them as a little thing for an escape, and I pour not out My fury in Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak;"
14012008,14,12,8,"but they become servants to him, and they know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.'"
14012009,14,12,9,"And Shishak king of Egypt cometh up against Jerusalem, and taketh the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king -- the whole he hath taken -- and he taketh the shields of gold that Solomon had made;"
14012010,14,12,10,"and king Rehoboam maketh in their stead shields of brass, and hath given `them' a charge on the hand of the heads of the runners who are keeping the opening of the house of the king;"
14012011,14,12,11,"and it cometh to pass, from the time of the going in of the king to the house of Jehovah, the runners have come in and lifted them up, and brought them back unto the chamber of the runners."
14012012,14,12,12,"And in his being humbled, turned back from him hath the wrath of Jehovah, so as not to destroy to completion; and also, in Judah there have been good things."
14012013,14,12,13,"And king Rehoboam strengtheneth himself in Jerusalem, and reigneth; for a son of forty and two years `is' Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah hath chosen to put His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel, and the name of his mother `is' Naamah the Ammonitess,"
14012014,14,12,14,"and he doth the evil thing, for he hath not prepared his heart to seek Jehovah."
14012015,14,12,15,"And the matters of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written among the matters of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogy? And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam `are' all the days;"
14012016,14,12,16,"and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David, and reign doth Abijah his son in his stead."
14013001,14,13,1,In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam -- Abijah reigneth over Judah;
14013002,14,13,2,"three years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, (and the name of his mother `is' Michaiah daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah,) and war hath been between Abijah and Jeroboam."
14013003,14,13,3,"And Abijah directeth the war with a force of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men, and Jeroboam hath set in array with him battle, with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty of valour."
14013004,14,13,4,"And Abijah riseth up on the hill of Zemaraim that `is' in the hill-country of Ephraim, and saith, `Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel!"
14013005,14,13,5,"Is it not for you to know that Jehovah, God of Israel, hath given the kingdom to David over Israel to the age, to him and to his sons -- a covenant of salt?"
14013006,14,13,6,"and rise up doth Jeroboam, son of Nebat, servant of Solomon son of David, and rebelleth against his lord!"
14013007,14,13,7,"`And there are gathered unto him vain men, sons of worthlessness, and they strengthen themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was a youth, and tender of heart, and hath not strengthened himself against them."
14013008,14,13,8,"`And now, ye are saying to strengthen yourselves before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David, and ye `are' a numerous multitude, and with you calves of gold that Jeroboam hath made to you for gods."
14013009,14,13,9,"`Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to you priests like the peoples of the lands? every one who hath come to fill his hand with a bullock, a son of the herd, and seven rams, even he hath been a priest to No-gods!"
14013010,14,13,10,"`As for us, Jehovah `is' our God, and we have not forsaken Him, and priests are ministering to Jehovah, sons of Aaron and the Levites, in the work,"
14013011,14,13,11,"and are making perfume to Jehovah, burnt-offerings morning by morning, and evening by evening, and perfume of spices, and the arrangement of bread `is' on the pure table, and the candlestick of gold, and its lamps, to burn evening by evening, for we are keeping the charge of Jehovah our God, and ye -- ye have forsaken Him."
14013012,14,13,12,"`And lo, with us -- at `our' head -- `is' God, and His priests and trumpets of shouting to shout against you; O sons of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah, God of your fathers, for ye do not prosper.'"
14013013,14,13,13,"And Jeroboam hath brought round the ambush to come in from behind them, and they are before Judah, and the ambush `is' behind them."
14013014,14,13,14,"And Judah turneth, and lo, against them `is' the battle, before and behind, and they cry to Jehovah, and the priests are blowing with trumpets,"
14013015,14,13,15,"and the men of Judah shout -- and it cometh to pass, at the shouting of the men of Judah, that God hath smitten Jeroboam, and all Israel, before Abijah and Judah."
14013016,14,13,16,"And the sons of Israel flee from the face of Judah, and God giveth them into their hand,"
14013017,14,13,17,"and Abijah and his people smite among them a great smiting, and there fall wounded of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14013018,14,13,18,"And the sons of Israel are humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah are strong, for they have leant on Jehovah, God of their fathers."
14013019,14,13,19,"And Abijah pursueth after Jeroboam, and captureth from him cities, Beth-El and its small towns, and Jeshanah and its small towns, and Ephraim and its small towns."
14013020,14,13,20,"And Jeroboam hath not retained power any more in the days of Abijah, and Jehovah smiteth him, and he dieth."
14013021,14,13,21,"And Abijah strengtheneth himself, and taketh to him fourteen wives, and begetteth twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters,"
14013022,14,13,22,"and the rest of the matters of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, are written in the `Inquiry' of the prophet Iddo."
14014001,14,14,1,"And Abijah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Asa his son in his stead: in his days was the land quiet ten years."
14014002,14,14,2,"And Asa doth that which is good, and that which is right, in the eyes of Jehovah his God,"
14014003,14,14,3,"and turneth aside the altars of the stranger, and the high places, and breaketh the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines,"
14014004,14,14,4,"and saith to Judah to seek Jehovah, God of their fathers, and to do the law and the command;"
14014005,14,14,5,"and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high places and the images, and the kingdom is quiet before him."
14014006,14,14,6,"And he buildeth cities of bulwarks in Judah, for the land hath quiet, and there is no war with him in these years, because Jehovah hath given rest to him."
14014007,14,14,7,"And he saith to Judah, `Let us build these cities, and compass `them' with wall, and towers, two-leaved doors, and bars, while the land `is' before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God, we have sought, and He giveth rest to us round about;' and they build and prosper."
14014008,14,14,8,"And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, bearing shield and treading bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these `are' mighty of valour."
14014009,14,14,9,"And come out unto them doth Zerah the Cushite with a force of a thousand thousand, and chariots three hundred, and he cometh in unto Mareshah,"
14014010,14,14,10,"and Asa goeth out before him, and they set battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14014011,14,14,11,"And Asa calleth unto Jehovah his God, and saith, `Jehovah! it is nothing with Thee to help, between the mighty and those who have no power; help us, O Jehovah, our God, for on Thee we have leant, and in Thy name we have come against this multitude; O Jehovah, our God thou `art'; let him not prevail with Thee -- mortal man!"
14014012,14,14,12,"And Jehovah smiteth the Cushim before Asa, and before Judah, and the Cushim flee,"
14014013,14,14,13,"and Asa and the people who `are' with him pursue them even to Gerar, and there fall of the Cushim, for they have no preserving, because they have been broken before Jehovah, and before His camp; and they bear away very much spoil,"
14014014,14,14,14,"and smite all the cities round about Gerar, for a fear of Jehovah hath been upon them, and they spoil all the cities, for abundant spoil hath been in them;"
14014015,14,14,15,"and also tents of cattle they have smitten, and they capture sheep in abundance, and camels, and turn back to Jerusalem."
14015001,14,15,1,"And upon Azariah son of Oded hath been the Spirit of God,"
14015002,14,15,2,"and he goeth out before Asa, and saith to him, `Hear, me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Jehovah `is' with you -- in your being with Him, and if ye seek Him, He is found of you, and if ye forsake Him, He forsaketh you;"
14015003,14,15,3,"and many days `are' to Israel without a true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law,"
14015004,14,15,4,"and it turneth back in its distress unto Jehovah, God of Israel, and they seek Him, and He is found of them,"
14015005,14,15,5,"and in those times there is no peace to him who is going out, and to him who is coming in, for many troubles `are' on all the inhabitants of the lands,"
14015006,14,15,6,"and they have been beaten down, nation by nation, and city by city, for God hath troubled them with every adversity;"
14015007,14,15,7,"and ye, be ye strong, and let not your hands be feeble, for there is a reward for your work.'"
14015008,14,15,8,"And at Asa's hearing these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he hath strengthened himself, and doth cause the abominations to pass away out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he hath captured from the hill-country of Ephraim, and reneweth the altar of Jehovah that `is' before the porch of Jehovah,"
14015009,14,15,9,"and gathereth all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon -- for they have fallen unto him from Israel in abundance, in their seeing that Jehovah his God `is' with him."
14015010,14,15,10,"And they are gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,"
14015011,14,15,11,"and sacrifice to Jehovah on that day from the spoil they have brought in -- oxen seven hundred, and sheep seven thousand,"
14015012,14,15,12,"and they enter into a covenant to seek Jehovah, God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul,"
14015013,14,15,13,"and every one who doth not seek for Jehovah, God of Israel, is put to death, from small unto great, from man unto woman."
14015014,14,15,14,"And they swear to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets,"
14015015,14,15,15,"and rejoice do all Judah concerning the oath, for with all their heart they have sworn, and with all their good-will they have sought Him, and He is found of them, and Jehovah giveth rest to them round about."
14015016,14,15,16,"And also Maachah, mother of Asa the king -- he hath removed her from `being' mistress, in that she hath made for a shrine a horrible thing, and Asa cutteth down her horrible thing, and beateth `it' small, and burneth `it' by the brook Kidron:"
14015017,14,15,17,"yet the high places have not turned aside from Israel; only, the heart of Asa hath been perfect all his days."
14015018,14,15,18,"And he bringeth in the sanctified things of his father, and his own sanctified things, to the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14015019,14,15,19,And war hath not been till the thirty and fifth year of the reign of Asa.
14016001,14,16,1,"In the thirty and sixth year of the reign of Asa, come up hath Baasha king of Israel, against Judah, and buildeth Ramah, so as not to permit any going out and coming in to Asa king of Judah."
14016002,14,16,2,"And Asa bringeth out silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the house of the king, and sendeth unto Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus, saying,"
14016003,14,16,3,"`A covenant `is' between me and thee, and between my father and thy father, lo, I have sent to thee silver and gold; go, break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he doth go up from off me.'"
14016004,14,16,4,"And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sendeth the heads of the forces that he hath unto cities of Israel, and they smite Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Maim, and all the stores, cities of Naphtali."
14016005,14,16,5,"And it cometh to pass, at Baasha's hearing, that he ceaseth from building Ramah, and letteth his work rest;"
14016006,14,16,6,"and Asa the king hath taken all Judah, and they bear away the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha hath built, and he buildeth with them Geba and Mizpah."
14016007,14,16,7,"And at that time hath Hanani the seer come in unto Asa king of Judah, and saith unto him, `Because of thy leaning on the king of Aram, and thou hast not leaned on Jehovah thy God, therefore hath the force of the king of Aram escaped from thy hand."
14016008,14,16,8,"Did not the Cushim and the Lubim become a very great force for multitude, for chariot, and for horsemen? and in thy leaning on Jehovah He gave them into thy hand,"
14016009,14,16,9,"for Jehovah -- His eyes go to and fro in all the earth, to show Himself strong `for' a people whose heart `is' perfect towards Him; thou hast been foolish concerning this, because -- henceforth there are with thee wars.'"
14016010,14,16,10,"And Asa is angry at the seer, and giveth him to the house of torture, for `he is' in a rage with him for this; and Asa oppresseth `some' of the people at that time."
14016011,14,16,11,"And lo, the matters of Asa, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14016012,14,16,12,"And Asa is diseased -- in the thirty and ninth year of his reign -- in his feet, till his disease is excessive, and also in his disease he hath not sought Jehovah, but among physicians."
14016013,14,16,13,"And Asa lieth with his fathers, and dieth in the forty and first year of his reign,"
14016014,14,16,14,"and they bury him in `one of' his graves, that he had prepared for himself in the city of David, and they cause him to lie on a bed that `one' hath filled `with' spices, and divers kinds of mixtures, with perfumed work; and they burn for him a burning -- very great."
14017001,14,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead, and he strengtheneth himself against Israel,"
14017002,14,17,2,"and putteth a force in all the fenced cities of Judah, and putteth garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured."
14017003,14,17,3,"And Jehovah is with Jehoshaphat, for he hath walked in the first ways of David his father, and hath not sought to Baalim,"
14017004,14,17,4,"for to the God of his father he hath sought, and in His commands he hath walked, and not according to the work of Israel."
14017005,14,17,5,"And Jehovah doth establish the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah give a present to Jehoshaphat, and he hath riches and honour in abundance,"
14017006,14,17,6,"and his heart is high in the ways of Jehovah, and again he hath turned aside the high places and the shrines out of Judah."
14017007,14,17,7,"And in the third year of his reign he hath sent for his heads, for Ben-Hail, and for Obadiah, and for Zechariah, and for Nethaneel, and for Michaiah, to teach in cities of Judah,"
14017008,14,17,8,"and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijath, and Tob-Adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests."
14017009,14,17,9,"And they teach in Judah, and with them `is' the Book of the Law of Jehovah, and they go round about into all cities of Judah, and teach among the people."
14017010,14,17,10,"And here is a fear of Jehovah on all kingdoms of the lands that `are' round about Judah, and they have not fought with Jehoshaphat;"
14017011,14,17,11,"and of the Philistines they are bringing in to Jehoshaphat a present, and tribute silver; also, the Arabians are bringing to him a flock, rams seven thousand an seven hundred, and he-goats seven thousand and seven hundred."
14017012,14,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat is going on and becoming very great, and he buildeth in Judah palaces and cities of store,"
14017013,14,17,13,"and he hath much work in cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty of valour, `are' in Jerusalem."
14017014,14,17,14,"And these `are' their numbers, for the house of their fathers: Of Judah, heads of thousands, Adnah the head, and with him mighty ones of valour, three hundred chiefs."
14017015,14,17,15,"And at his hand `is' Jehohanan the head, and with him two hundred and eighty chiefs."
14017016,14,17,16,"And at his hand `is' Amasiah son of Zichri, who is willingly offering himself to Jehovah, and with him two hundred chiefs, mighty of valour."
14017017,14,17,17,"And of Benjamin: mighty of valour, Eliada, and with him, armed with bow and shield, two hundred chiefs."
14017018,14,17,18,"And at his hand `is' Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty chiefs, armed ones of the host."
14017019,14,17,19,"These `are' those serving the king, apart from those whom the king put in the cities of fortress, in all Judah."
14018001,14,18,1,"And Jehoshaphat hath riches and honour in abundance, and joineth affinity to Ahab,"
14018002,14,18,2,"and goeth down at the end of `certain' years unto Ahab to Samaria, and Ahab sacrificeth for him sheep and oxen in abundance, and for the people who `are' with him, and persuadeth him to go up unto Ramoth-Gilead."
14018003,14,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, `Dost thou go with me `to' Ramoth-Gilead?' And he saith to him, `As I -- so thou, and as thy people -- my people, even with thee in battle.'"
14018004,14,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, `Seek, I pray thee, this day, the word of Jehovah.'"
14018005,14,18,5,"And the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, four hundred men, and saith unto them, `Do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' And they say, `Go up, and God doth give `it' into the hand of the king.'"
14018006,14,18,6,"And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah still, and we seek from him?'"
14018007,14,18,7,"And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Still -- one man to seek Jehovah from him, and I -- I have hated him, for he is not prophesying concerning me of good, but all his days of evil, he `is' Micaiah son of Imlah;' and Jehoshaphat saith, `Let not the king say so.'"
14018008,14,18,8,"And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain officer, and saith, `Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.'"
14018009,14,18,9,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, and they are sitting in a threshing-floor at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets are prophesying before them."
14018010,14,18,10,"And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of iron, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah,"
14018011,14,18,11,"With these thou dost push Aram till thou hast consumed them.' And all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, `Go up `to' Ramath-Gilead and prosper, and Jehovah hath given `it' into the hand of the king.'"
14018012,14,18,12,"And the messenger who hath gone to call for Micaiah hath spoken unto him, saying, `Lo, the words of the prophets -- one mouth -- `are' good towards the king, and let, I pray thee, thy word be like one of theirs: and thou hast spoken good.'"
14018013,14,18,13,"And Micaiah saith `Jehovah liveth, surely that which my God saith, it I speak.'"
14018014,14,18,14,"And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto him, `Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' And he saith, `Go ye up, and prosper, and they are given into your hand.'"
14018015,14,18,15,"And the king saith unto him, `How many times am I adjuring thee, that thou speak unto me only truth in the name of Jehovah?'"
14018016,14,18,16,"And he saith, `I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd, and Jehovah saith, There are no masters to these, they turn back each to his house in peace.'"
14018017,14,18,17,"And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, `Did I not say unto thee, He doth not prophesy concerning me good, but rather of evil?'"
14018018,14,18,18,"And he saith, `Therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right and His left;"
14018019,14,18,19,"and Jehovah saith, Who doth entice Ahab king of Israel, and he doth go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? And this speaker saith thus, and that speaker thus."
14018020,14,18,20,"And go out doth the spirit, and stand before Jehovah, and saith, I do entice him; and Jehovah saith unto him, With what?"
14018021,14,18,21,"and he saith, I go out, and have become a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And He saith, Thou dost entice, and also, thou art able; go out and do so."
14018022,14,18,22,"And, now, lo, Jehovah hath put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these thy prophets, and Jehovah hath spoken concerning thee -- evil.'"
14018023,14,18,23,"And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah cometh nigh, and smiteth Micaiah on the cheek, and saith, `Where `is' this -- the way the Spirit of Jehovah passed over from me to speak with thee?'"
14018024,14,18,24,"And Micaiah saith, `Lo, thou dost see in that day, that thou dost enter into the innermost chamber to be hidden.'"
14018025,14,18,25,"And the king of Israel saith, `Take ye Micaiah, and turn him back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the king,"
14018026,14,18,26,"and ye have said, Thus said the king, Put ye this `one' in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of oppression, and water of oppression, till my return in peace.'"
14018027,14,18,27,"And Micaiah saith, `If thou dost certainly return in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me;' and he saith, `Hear ye, O peoples, all of them!'"
14018028,14,18,28,"And the king of Israel goeth up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, unto Ramoth-Gilead;"
14018029,14,18,29,"and the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself, and to go into battle, `And thou, put on thy garments.' And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and they go into battle."
14018030,14,18,30,"And the king of Aram hath commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he hath, saying, `Ye do not fight with small or with great, except with the king of Israel by himself.'"
14018031,14,18,31,"And it cometh to pass at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat, that they have said, `The king of Israel he is,' and they turn round against him to fight, and Jehoshaphat crieth out, and Jehovah hath helped him, and God enticeth them from him,"
14018032,14,18,32,"yea, it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing that it hath not been the king of Israel -- they turn back from after him."
14018033,14,18,33,"And a man hath drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of mail, and he saith to the charioteer, `Turn thy hand, and thou hast brought me out of the camp, for I have become sick.'"
14018034,14,18,34,"And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king of Israel hath been stayed up in the chariot over-against Aram till the evening, and he dieth at the time of the going in of the sun."
14019001,14,19,1,"And Jehoshaphat king of Judah turneth back unto his house in peace to Jerusalem,"
14019002,14,19,2,"and go out unto his presence doth Jehu son of Hanani, the seer, and saith unto king Jehoshaphat, `To give help to the wicked, and to those hating Jehovah, dost thou love? and for this against thee `is' wrath from before Jehovah,"
14019003,14,19,3,"but good things have been found with thee, for thou hast put away the shrines out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.'"
14019004,14,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelleth in Jerusalem, and he turneth back and goeth out among the people from Beer-Sheba unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and bringeth them back unto Jehovah, God of their fathers."
14019005,14,19,5,"And he establisheth judges in the land, in all the fenced cities of Judah, for every city,"
14019006,14,19,6,"and saith unto the judges, `See what ye are doing -- for not for man do ye judge, but for Jehovah, who `is' with you in the matter of judgment;"
14019007,14,19,7,"and now, let fear of Jehovah be upon you, observe and do, for there is not with Jehovah our God perverseness, and acceptance of faces, and taking of a bribe.'"
14019008,14,19,8,"And also in Jerusalem hath Jehoshaphat appointed of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for strife; and they turn back to Jerusalem,"
14019009,14,19,9,"and he layeth a charge upon them, saying, `Thus do ye do in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness, and with a perfect heart,"
14019010,14,19,10,"and any strife that cometh in unto you of your brethren who are dwelling in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and command, statutes, and judgments, then ye have warned them and they become not guilty before Jehovah, and wrath hath not been on you and on your brethren; thus do ye do, and ye are not guilty."
14019011,14,19,11,"`And, lo, Amariah the head priest `is' over you for every matter of Jehovah, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, `is' for every matter of the king, and officers the Levites `are' before you; be strong and do, and Jehovah is with the good.'"
14020001,14,20,1,"And it cometh to pass after this, the sons of Moab have come in, and the sons of Ammon, and with them of the peoples, against Jehoshaphat to battle."
14020002,14,20,2,"And they come in and declare to Jehoshaphat, saying, `Come against thee hath a great multitude from beyond the sea, from Aram, and lo, they `are' in Hazezon-Tamar -- it `is' En-Gedi.'"
14020003,14,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feareth, and setteth his face to seek to Jehovah, and proclaimeth a fast over all Judah;"
14020004,14,20,4,"and Judah is gathered to inquire of Jehovah; also, from all the cities of Judah they have come in to seek Jehovah."
14020005,14,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat standeth in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, at the front of the new court,"
14020006,14,20,6,"and saith, `O Jehovah, God of our fathers, art not Thou -- God in the heavens? yea, Thou art ruling over all kingdoms of the nations, and in Thy hand `is' power and might, and there is none with Thee to station himself."
14020007,14,20,7,"`Art not Thou our God? Thou hast dispossessed the inhabitants of this land from before Thy people Israel, and dost give it to the seed of Abraham Thy friend to the age,"
14020008,14,20,8,"and they dwell in it, and build to Thee in it a sanctuary for Thy name, saying,"
14020009,14,20,9,"If evil doth come upon us -- sword, judgment, and pestilence, and famine -- we stand before this house, and before Thee, for Thy name `is' in this house, and cry unto Thee out of our distress, and Thou dost hear and save."
14020010,14,20,10,"`And now, lo, sons of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom Thou didst not grant to Israel to go in against in their coming out of the land of Egypt, for they turned aside from off them and destroyed them not,"
14020011,14,20,11,"and lo, they are recompensing to us -- to come in to drive us out of Thy possession, that Thou hast caused us to possess."
14020012,14,20,12,"`O our God, dost Thou not execute judgment upon them? for there is no power in us before this great multitude that hath come against us, and we know not what we do, but on Thee `are' our eyes.'"
14020013,14,20,13,"And all Judah are standing before Jehovah, also their infants, their wives, and their sons."
14020014,14,20,14,"And upon Jahaziel, son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, hath the Spirit of Jehovah been, in the midst of the assembly,"
14020015,14,20,15,"and he saith, `Attend, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and O king Jehoshaphat, Thus said Jehovah to you, Ye fear not, nor are afraid of the face of this great multitude, for not for you `is' the battle, but for God."
14020016,14,20,16,"To-morrow, go ye down against them, lo, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and ye have found them in the end of the valley, the front of the wilderness of Jeruel."
14020017,14,20,17,"Not for you to fight in this; station yourselves, stand, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem -- be not afraid nor fear ye -- to-morrow go out before them, and Jehovah `is' with you.'"
14020018,14,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat boweth -- face to the earth -- and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have fallen before Jehovah, to bow themselves to Jehovah."
14020019,14,20,19,"And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the sons of the Korhites, rise to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel, with a loud voice on high."
14020020,14,20,20,"And they rise early in the morning, and go out to the wilderness of Tekoa, and in their going out Jehoshaphat hath stood and saith, `Hear me, O Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, remain stedfast in Jehovah your God, and be stedfast; remain stedfast in His prophets, and prosper.'"
14020021,14,20,21,"And he taketh counsel with the people, and appointeth singers to Jehovah, and those giving praise to the honour of holiness, in the going out before the armed `men', and saying, `Give ye thanks to Jehovah, for to the age `is' His kindness.'"
14020022,14,20,22,"And at the time they have begun with singing and praise, Jehovah hath put ambushments against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who are coming in to Judah, and they are smitten,"
14020023,14,20,23,"and the sons of Ammon stand up, and Moab, against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to devote and to destroy, and at their finishing with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped, a man against his neighbour, to destroy."
14020024,14,20,24,"And Judah hath come in unto the watch-tower, to the wilderness, and they look unto the multitude, and lo, they `are' carcases fallen to the earth, and there is none escaped,"
14020025,14,20,25,"and Jehoshaphat cometh in, and his people, to seize their spoil, and they find among them, in abundance, both goods and carcases, and desirable vessels, and they take spoil to themselves without prohibition, and they are three days seizing the spoil, for it `is' abundant."
14020026,14,20,26,"And on the fourth day they have been assembled at the valley of Blessing, for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore they have called the name of that place, `Valley of Blessing,' unto this day."
14020027,14,20,27,"And they turn back, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to go back unto Jerusalem with joy, for Jehovah hath made them rejoice over their enemies."
14020028,14,20,28,"And they come in to Jerusalem with psalteries, and with harps, and with trumpets, unto the house of Jehovah."
14020029,14,20,29,"And there is a fear of God on all kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Jehovah hath fought with the enemies of Israel,"
14020030,14,20,30,"and the kingdom of Jehoshaphat is quiet, and his God giveth rest to him round about."
14020031,14,20,31,"And Jehoshaphat reigneth over Judah, a son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Azubah daughter of Shilhi."
14020032,14,20,32,"And he walketh in the way of his father Asa, and hath not turned aside from it, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah."
14020033,14,20,33,"Only, the high places have not turned aside, and still the people have not prepared their heart for the God of their fathers."
14020034,14,20,34,"And the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, lo, they are written among the matters of Jehu son of Hanani, who hath been mentioned on the book of the kings of Israel."
14020035,14,20,35,"And after this hath Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, (he did wickedly in `so' doing),"
14020036,14,20,36,"and he joineth him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they make ships in Ezion-Geber,"
14020037,14,20,37,"and prophesy doth Eliezer son of Dodavah, of Mareshah, against Jehoshaphat, saying, `For thy joining thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath broken up thy works;' and the ships are broken, and have not retained `power' to go unto Tarshish."
14021001,14,21,1,"And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigneth in his stead."
14021002,14,21,2,"And he hath brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these `are' sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel,"
14021003,14,21,3,"and their father giveth to them many gifts of silver and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, and the kingdom he hath given to Jehoram, for He `is' the first-born."
14021004,14,21,4,"And Jehoram riseth up over the kingdom of his father, and strengtheneth himself, and slayeth all his brethren with the sword, and also -- of the heads of Israel."
14021005,14,21,5,"A son of thirty and two years `is' Jehoram in his reigning, and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,"
14021006,14,21,6,"and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab hath been to him for a wife, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,"
14021007,14,21,7,"and Jehovah hath not been willing to destroy the house of David, for the sake of the covenant that He made with David, and as He had said to give to him a lamp, and to his sons -- all the days."
14021008,14,21,8,"In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and cause a king to reign over them;"
14021009,14,21,9,"and Jehoram passeth over with his heads, and all the chariots with him, and it cometh to pass, he hath risen by night and smiteth the Edomites who are coming round against him, and the princes of the chariots,"
14021010,14,21,10,"and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time from under his hand, because he hath forsaken Jehovah, God of his fathers,"
14021011,14,21,11,"also, he hath made high places in the mountains of Judah, and causeth the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom, and compelleth Judah."
14021012,14,21,12,"And there cometh in unto him a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, `Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, Because that thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,"
14021013,14,21,13,"and thou dost walk in the way of the kings of Israel, and dost cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom like the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also thy brethren, the house of thy father, who are better than thyself, thou hast slain;"
14021014,14,21,14,"lo, Jehovah is smiting -- a great smiting -- among thy people, and among thy sons, and among thy wives, and among all thy goods --"
14021015,14,21,15,"and thou, with many sicknesses, with disease of thy bowels, till thy bowels come out, by the sickness, day by day.'"
14021016,14,21,16,"And Jehovah waketh up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who `are' beside the Cushim,"
14021017,14,21,17,"and they come up into Judah, and rend it, and take captive all the substance that is found at the house of the king, and also his sons, and his wives, and there hath not been left to him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons."
14021018,14,21,18,"And after all this hath Jehovah plagued him in his bowels by a disease for which there is no healing,"
14021019,14,21,19,"and it cometh to pass, from days to days, and at the time of the going out of the end of two years, his bowels have gone out with his sickness, and he dieth of sore diseases, and his people have not made for him a burning like the burning of his fathers."
14021020,14,21,20,"A son of thirty and two `years' was he in his reigning, and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he goeth without desire, and they bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings."
14022001,14,22,1,"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem cause Ahaziah his youngest son to reign in his stead, (for all the elder had the troop slain that came in with the Arabians to the camp,) and Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigneth."
14022002,14,22,2,"A son of twenty and two years `is' Ahaziah in his reigning, and one year he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Athaliah daughter of Omri;"
14022003,14,22,3,"he also hath walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother hath been his counsellor to do wickedly."
14022004,14,22,4,"And he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for they have been his counsellors, after the death of his father, for destruction to him."
14022005,14,22,5,"Also, in their counsel he hath walked, and goeth with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to battle against Hazael king of Aram, in Ramoth-Gilead, and they of Ramah smite Joram;"
14022006,14,22,6,"and he turneth back to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds with which they had smitten him in Ramah, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah hath gone down to see Jehoram son of Ahab, in Jezreel, for he `is' sick;"
14022007,14,22,7,"and from God hath been the destruction of Ahaziah, to come unto Joram: and in his coming he hath gone out with Jehoram unto Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
14022008,14,22,8,"And it cometh to pass, in Jehu's executing judgment with the house of Ahab, that he findeth the heads of Judah and sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministers of Ahaziah, and slayeth them."
14022009,14,22,9,"And he seeketh Ahaziah, and they capture him, (and he is hiding himself in Samaria), and bring him in unto Jehu, and put him to death, and bury him, for they said, `He `is' son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart;' and there is none to the house of Ahaziah to retain power for the kingdom."
14022010,14,22,10,"And Athaliah mother of Ahaziah hath seen that her son is dead, and she riseth and destroyeth the whole seed of the kingdom of the house of Judah."
14022011,14,22,11,"And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king taketh Joash son of Ahaziah, and stealeth him from the midst of the sons of the king who are put to death, and putteth him and his nurse into the inner part of the bed-chambers, and Jehoshabeath daughter of king Jehoram, wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she hath been sister of Ahaziah, hideth him from the face of Athaliah, and she hath not put him to death."
14022012,14,22,12,"And he is with them in the house of God hiding himself six years, and Athaliah is reigning over the land."
14023001,14,23,1,"And in the seventh year hath Jehoiada strengthened himself, and taketh the heads of the hundreds, even Azariah son of Jeroham, and Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and Azariah son of Obed, and Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri, with him into covenant."
14023002,14,23,2,"And they go round about in Judah, and gather the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and heads of the fathers of Israel, and come in unto Jerusalem,"
14023003,14,23,3,"and all the assembly make a covenant in the house of God with the king, and he saith to them, `Lo, the son of the king doth reign, as Jehovah spake concerning the sons of David."
14023004,14,23,4,"`This `is' the thing that ye do: The third of you, going in on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, `are' for gatekeepers of the thresholds,"
14023005,14,23,5,"and the third `are' at the house of the king, and the third at the gate of the foundation, and all the people `are' in the courts of the house of Jehovah."
14023006,14,23,6,"`And none doth enter the house of Jehovah except the priests, and those ministering of the Levites (they go in for they `are' holy), and all the people keep the watch of Jehovah:"
14023007,14,23,7,"and the Levites have compassed the king round about, each with his weapon in his hand, and he who hath gone in unto the house is put to death; and be ye with the king in his coming in and in his going out.'"
14023008,14,23,8,"And the Levites and all Judah do according to all that Jehoiada the priest hath commanded, and take each his men going in on the sabbath, with those going out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest hath not let away the courses."
14023009,14,23,9,"And Jehoiada the priest giveth to the heads of the hundreds the spears, and the shields, and the bucklers that `are' king David's, that `are' in the house of God;"
14023010,14,23,10,"and he stationeth the whole of the people, and each his dart in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house unto the left shoulder of the house, at the altar, and at the house, by the king, round about."
14023011,14,23,11,"And they bring out the son of the king, and put upon him the crown, and the testimony, and cause him to reign; and Jehoiada and his sons anoint him, and say, `Let the king live!'"
14023012,14,23,12,"And Athaliah heareth the voice of the people who are running, and who are praising the king, and she cometh in unto the people in the house of Jehovah,"
14023013,14,23,13,"and seeth, and lo, the king is standing by his pillar in the entrance, and the heads, and the trumpets `are' by the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and shouting with trumpets, and the singers with instruments of song, and the teachers, to praise, and Athaliah rendeth her garments, and saith, `Conspiracy, conspiracy.'"
14023014,14,23,14,"And Jehoiada the priest bringeth out the heads of the hundreds, inspectors of the force, and saith unto them, `Take her out from within the rows, and he who hath gone after her is put to death by the sword;' for the priest said, `Put her not to death `in' the house of Jehovah.'"
14023015,14,23,15,"And they make for her sides, and she cometh in unto the entrance of the gate of the horses at the house of the king, and they put her to death there."
14023016,14,23,16,"And Jehoiada maketh a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, to be for a people to Jehovah;"
14023017,14,23,17,"and all the people enter the house of Baal, and break it down, yea, his altars and his images they have broken, and Mattan priest of Baal they have slain before the altars."
14023018,14,23,18,"And Jehoiada putteth the offices of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had apportioned over the house of Jehovah, to cause to ascend the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as written in the law of Moses, with joy, and with singing, by the hands of David;"
14023019,14,23,19,"and he stationeth the gatekeepers over the gates of the house of Jehovah, and the unclean in anything doth not go in."
14023020,14,23,20,"And he taketh the heads of the hundreds, and the honourable ones, and the rulers among the people, and all the people of the land, and bringeth down the king from the house of Jehovah, and they come in through the high gate to the house of the king, and cause the king to sit on the throne of the kingdom."
14023021,14,23,21,"And all the people of the land rejoice, and the city hath been quiet, and Athaliah they have put to death by the sword."
14024001,14,24,1,"A son of seven years `is' Joash in his reigning, and forty years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Zibiah of Beer-Sheba."
14024002,14,24,2,And Joash doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
14024003,14,24,3,"And Jehoiada taketh for him two wives, and he begetteth sons and daughters."
14024004,14,24,4,"And it cometh to pass after this, it hath been with the heart of Joash to renew the house of Jehovah,"
14024005,14,24,5,"and he gathereth the priests and the Levites, and saith to them, `Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year, and ye, ye do haste to the matter;' and the Levites have not hasted."
14024006,14,24,6,"And the king calleth for Jehoiada the head, and saith to him, `Wherefore hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses, servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?"
14024007,14,24,7,"for sons of Athaliah, the wicked one, have broken up the house of God, and also, all the holy things of the house of Jehovah they have prepared for Baalim.'"
14024008,14,24,8,"And the king speaketh, and they make one chest, and put it at the gate of the house of Jehovah without,"
14024009,14,24,9,"and give an intimation in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring in to Jehovah the tribute of Moses, servant of God, `laid' on Israel in the wilderness."
14024010,14,24,10,"And all the heads, and all the people rejoice, and they bring in, and cast into the chest, unto completion."
14024011,14,24,11,"And it cometh to pass, at the time one bringeth in the chest for the inspection of the king by the hand of the Levites, and at their seeing that the money `is' abundant, that a scribe of the king hath come in, and an officer of the head-priest, and they empty the chest, and take it up and turn it back unto its place; thus they have done day by day, and gather money in abundance."
14024012,14,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada give it unto the doers of the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and they are hiring hewers and artificers to renew the house of Jehovah, and also -- to artificers in iron and brass to strengthen the house of Jehovah."
14024013,14,24,13,"And those doing the business work, and there goeth up lengthening to the work by their hand, and they establish the house of God, by its proper measure, and strengthen it."
14024014,14,24,14,"And at their completing `it', they have brought in before the king and Jehoiada the rest of the money, and they make it vessels for the house of Jehovah, vessels of serving, and of offering up, and spoons, even vessels of gold and silver; and they are causing burnt-offerings to ascend in the house of Jehovah continually, all the days of Jehoiada."
14024015,14,24,15,"And Jehoiada is aged and satisfied with days, and dieth -- a son of a hundred and thirty years in his death,"
14024016,14,24,16,"and they bury him in the city of David, with the kings, for he hath done good in Israel, and with God, and his house."
14024017,14,24,17,"And after the death of Jehoiada come in have heads of Judah, and bow themselves to the king; then hath the king hearkened unto them,"
14024018,14,24,18,"and they forsake the house of Jehovah, God of their fathers, and serve the shrines and the idols, and there is wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt."
14024019,14,24,19,"And He sendeth among them prophets, to bring them back unto Jehovah, and they testify against them, and they have not given ear;"
14024020,14,24,20,"and the Spirit of God hath clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he standeth over-against the people, and saith to them, `Thus said God, Why are ye transgressing the commands of Jehovah, and prosper not? because ye have forsaken Jehovah -- He doth forsake you.'"
14024021,14,24,21,"And they conspire against him, and stone him with stones by the command of the king, in the court of the house of Jehovah,"
14024022,14,24,22,"and Joash the king hath not remembered the kindness that Jehoiada his father did with him, and slayeth his son, and in his death he said, `Jehovah doth see, and require.'"
14024023,14,24,23,"And it cometh to pass, at the turn of the year, come up hath the force of Aram against him, and they come in unto Judah and Jerusalem, and destroy all the heads of the people from the people, and all their spoil they have sent to the king of Damascus,"
14024024,14,24,24,"for with few men have the force of Aram come in, and Jehovah hath given into their hand a mighty force for multitude, because they have forsaken Jehovah, God of their fathers; and with Joash they have executed judgments."
14024025,14,24,25,"And in their going from him -- for they left him with many diseases -- his servants themselves have conspired against him, for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slay him on his bed, and he dieth; and they bury him in the city of David, and have not buried him in the graves of the kings."
14024026,14,24,26,"And these `are' those conspiring against him, Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess."
14024027,14,24,27,"As to his sons, and the greatness of the burden upon him, and the foundation of the house of God, lo, they are written on the `Inquiry' of the book of the Kings; and reign doth Amaziah his son in his stead."
14025001,14,25,1,"A son of twenty and five years hath Amaziah reigned, and twenty and nine years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Jehoaddan of Jerusalem,"
14025002,14,25,2,"and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah -- only, not with a perfect heart."
14025003,14,25,3,"And it cometh to pass, when the kingdom hath been strong upon him, that he slayeth his servants, those smiting the king his father,"
14025004,14,25,4,"and their sons he hath not put to death, but `did' as is written in the law, in the book of Moses, whom Jehovah commanded, saying, `Fathers do not die for sons, and sons die not for fathers, but each for his own sin they die.'"
14025005,14,25,5,"And Amaziah gathereth Judah, and appointeth them, according to the house of the fathers, for heads of the thousands, and for heads of the hundreds, for all Judah and Benjamin; and he inspecteth them from a son of twenty years and upward, and findeth them three hundred thousand chosen ones, going forth to the host, holding spear and target."
14025006,14,25,6,"And he hireth out of Israel a hundred thousand mighty ones of valour, with a hundred talents of silver;"
14025007,14,25,7,"and a man of God hath come in unto him, saying, `O king, the host of Israel doth not go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel -- all the sons of Ephraim;"
14025008,14,25,8,"but if thou art going -- do `it', be strong for battle, God doth cause thee to stumble before an enemy, for there is power in God to help, and to cause to stumble.'"
14025009,14,25,9,"And Amaziah saith to the man of God, `And what -- to do for the hundred talents that I have given to the troop of Israel?' And the man of God saith, `Jehovah hath more to give to thee than this.'"
14025010,14,25,10,"And Amaziah separateth them -- for the troop that hath come in unto him from Ephraim to go to their own place, and their anger doth burn mightily against Judah, and they turn back to their place in the heat of anger."
14025011,14,25,11,"And Amaziah hath strengthened himself, and leadeth his people, and goeth to the Valley of Salt, and smiteth the sons of Seir -- ten thousand."
14025012,14,25,12,"And ten thousand alive have the sons of Judah taken captive, and they bring them to the top of the rock, and cast them from the top of the rock, and all of them have been broken."
14025013,14,25,13,"And the sons of the troop that Amaziah hath sent back from going with him to battle -- they rush against cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-Horon, and smite of them three thousand, and seize much prey."
14025014,14,25,14,"And it cometh to pass, after the coming in of Amaziah from smiting the Edomites, that he bringeth in the gods of the sons of Seir, and establisheth them to him for gods, and before them doth bow himself, and to them he maketh perfume."
14025015,14,25,15,"And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Amaziah, and He sendeth unto him a prophet, and he saith unto him, `Why hast thou sought the gods of the people that have not delivered their people out of thy hand?'"
14025016,14,25,16,"And it cometh to pass, in his speaking unto him, that he saith to him, `For a counsellor to the king have we appointed thee? cease for thee; why do they smite thee?' And the prophet ceaseth, and saith, `I have known that God hath counselled to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.'"
14025017,14,25,17,"And Amaziah king of Judah taketh counsel, and sendeth unto Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,"
14025018,14,25,18,"`Come, we look one another in the face.' And Joash king of Israel sendeth unto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, `The thorn that `is' in Lebanon hath sent unto the cedar that `is' in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife; and pass by doth a beast of the field that `is' in Lebanon, and treadeth down the thorn."
14025019,14,25,19,"Thou hast said, Lo, I have smitten Edom; and thy heart hath lifted thee up to boast; now, abide in thy house, why dost thou stir thyself up in evil, that thou hast fallen, thou, and Judah with thee?'"
14025020,14,25,20,"And Amaziah hath not hearkened, for from God it `is' in order to give them into hand, because they have sought the gods of Edom;"
14025021,14,25,21,"and go up doth Joash king of Israel, and they look one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in Beth-Shemesh, that `is' Judah's,"
14025022,14,25,22,"and Judah is smitten before Israel, and they flee -- each to his tents."
14025023,14,25,23,"And Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, hath Joash king of Israel caught in Beth-Shemesh, and bringeth him in to Jerusalem, and breaketh down in the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits,"
14025024,14,25,24,"and `taketh' all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that are found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the house of the king, and the sons of the pledges, and turneth back to Samaria."
14025025,14,25,25,"And Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, liveth after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years;"
14025026,14,25,26,"and the rest of the matters of Amaziah, the first and the last, lo, are they not written on the books of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
14025027,14,25,27,"And from the time that Amaziah hath turned aside from after Jehovah -- they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fleeth to Lachish, and they send after him to Lachish, and put him to death there,"
14025028,14,25,28,"and lift him up on the horses, and bury him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14026001,14,26,1,"And all the people of Judah take Uzziah (and he `is' a son of sixteen years), and cause him to reign instead of his father Amaziah."
14026002,14,26,2,"He hath built Eloth, and restoreth it to Judah after the king's lying with his fathers."
14026003,14,26,3,"A son of sixteen years `is' Uzziah in his reigning, and fifty and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Jecholiah of Jerusalem."
14026004,14,26,4,"And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Amaziah his father did,"
14026005,14,26,5,"and he is as one seeking God in the days of Zechariah who hath understanding in visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Jehovah, God hath caused him to prosper."
14026006,14,26,6,"And he goeth forth, and fighteth with the Philistines, and breaketh down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and buildeth cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14026007,14,26,7,"And God helpeth him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who are dwelling in Gur-Baal and the Mehunim."
14026008,14,26,8,"And the Ammonites give a present to Uzziah, and his name goeth unto the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened himself greatly."
14026009,14,26,9,"And Uzziah buildeth towers in Jerusalem, by the gate of the corner, and by the gate of the valley, and by the angle, and strengtheneth them;"
14026010,14,26,10,"and he buildeth towers in the wilderness, and diggeth many wells, for he had much cattle, both in the low country and in the plain, husbandmen and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he was a lover of the ground."
14026011,14,26,11,"And Uzziah hath a force, making war, going forth to the host, by troops, in the number of their reckoning by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Masseiah the officer, by the hand of Hananiah `one' of the heads of the king."
14026012,14,26,12,The whole number of heads of the fathers of the mighty ones of valour `is' two thousand and six hundred;
14026013,14,26,13,"and by their hand `is' the force of the host, three hundred thousand, and seven thousand, and five hundred warriors, with mighty power to give help to the king against the enemy."
14026014,14,26,14,"And Uzziah prepareth for them, for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, even to stones of the slings."
14026015,14,26,15,"And he maketh in Jerusalem inventions -- a device of an inventor -- to be on the towers, and on the corners, to shoot with arrows and with great stones, and his name goeth out unto a distance, for he hath been wonderfully helped till that he hath been strong."
14026016,14,26,16,"And at his being strong his heart hath been high unto destruction, and he trespasseth against Jehovah his God, and goeth in unto the temple of Jehovah to make perfume upon the altar of perfume."
14026017,14,26,17,"And Azariah the priest goeth in after him, and with him priests of Jehovah eighty, sons of valour,"
14026018,14,26,18,"and they stand up against Uzziah the king, and say to him, `Not for thee, O Uzziah, to make perfume to Jehovah, but for priests, sons of Aaron, who are sanctified to make perfume; go forth from the sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed, and `it is' not to thee for honour from Jehovah God.'"
14026019,14,26,19,"And Uzziah is wroth, and in his hand `is' a censer to make perfume, and in his being wroth with the priests -- the leprosy hath risen in his forehead, before the priests, in the house of Jehovah, from beside the altar of perfume."
14026020,14,26,20,"And Azariah the head priest looketh unto him, and all the priests, and lo, he `is' leprous in his forehead, and they hasten him thence, and also he himself hath hastened to go out, for Jehovah hath plagued him."
14026021,14,26,21,"And Uzziah the king is a leper unto the day of his death, and inhabiteth a separate house -- a leper, for he hath been cut off from the house of Jehovah, and Jotham his son `is' over the house of the king, judging the people of the land."
14026022,14,26,22,"And the rest of the matters of Uzziah, the first and the last, hath Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet written;"
14026023,14,26,23,"and Uzziah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him with his fathers, in the field of the burying-place that the kings have, for they said, `He `is' a leper;' and reign doth Jotham his son in his stead."
14027001,14,27,1,"A son of twenty and five years `is' Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Jerushah daughter of Zadok."
14027002,14,27,2,"And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he hath not come in unto the temple of Jehovah; and again are the people doing corruptly."
14027003,14,27,3,"He hath built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and in the wall of Ophel he hath built abundantly;"
14027004,14,27,4,"and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he hath built palaces and towers."
14027005,14,27,5,"And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten thousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third."
14027006,14,27,6,"And Jotham doth strengthen himself, for he hath prepared his ways before Jehovah his God."
14027007,14,27,7,"And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14027008,14,27,8,"A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;"
14027009,14,27,9,"and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaz his son in his stead."
14028001,14,28,1,"A son of twenty years `is' Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he hath not done that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, as David his father,"
14028002,14,28,2,"and walketh in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also, molten images hath made for Baalim,"
14028003,14,28,3,"and himself hath made perfume in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burneth his sons with fire according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,"
14028004,14,28,4,"and sacrificeth and maketh perfume in high places, and on the heights, and under every green tree."
14028005,14,28,5,"And Jehovah his God giveth him into the hand of the king of Aram, and they smite him, and take captive from him a great captivity, and bring `them' in to Damascus, and also into the hand of the king of Israel he hath been given, and he smiteth him -- a great smiting."
14028006,14,28,6,"And Pekah son of Remaliah slayeth in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day (the whole `are' sons of valour), because of their forsaking Jehovah, God of their fathers."
14028007,14,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty one of Ephraim, slayeth Maaseiah son of the king, and Azrikam leader of the house, and Elkanah second to the king."
14028008,14,28,8,"And the sons of Israel take captive of their brethren, two hundred thousand, wives, sons and daughters, and also much spoil they have seized from them, and they bring in the spoil to Samaria."
14028009,14,28,9,"And there hath been there a prophet of Jehovah (Oded `is' his name), and he goeth out before the host that hath come in to Samaria, and saith to them, `Lo, in the fury of Jehovah God of your fathers against Judah, He hath given them into your hand, and ye slay among them in rage -- unto the heavens it hath come;"
14028010,14,28,10,"and now, sons of Judah and Jerusalem ye are saying to subdue for men-servants and for maid-servants to you; but are there not with you causes of guilt before Jehovah your God?"
14028011,14,28,11,"and now, hear me, and send back the captives whom ye have taken captive of your brethren, for the heat of the anger of Jehovah `is' upon you.'"
14028012,14,28,12,"And certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim (Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai), rise up against those coming in from the host,"
14028013,14,28,13,"and say to them, `Ye do not bring in the captives hither, for, to guilt against Jehovah on us, ye are saying to add unto our sin and unto our guilt? for abundant `is' the guilt we have, and the fierceness of anger on Israel.'"
14028014,14,28,14,And the armed men leave the captives and the prey before the heads and all the assembly;
14028015,14,28,15,"and the men who have been expressed by name rise and take hold on the captives, and all their naked ones they have clothed from the spoil, yea, they clothe them, and shoe them, and cause them to eat and drink, and anoint them, and lead them on asses, even every feeble one, and bring them in to Jericho, the city of palms, near their brethren, and turn back to Samaria."
14028016,14,28,16,At that time hath king Ahaz sent unto the king of Asshur to give help to him;
14028017,14,28,17,"and again the Edomites have come, and smite in Judah, and take captive a captivity."
14028018,14,28,18,"And the Philistines have rushed against the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and capture Beth-Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho and its villages, and Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages, and dwell there,"
14028019,14,28,19,"for Jehovah hath humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he made free with Judah, even to commit a trespass against Jehovah."
14028020,14,28,20,"And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur cometh in unto him, and doth distress him, and hath not strengthened him,"
14028021,14,28,21,"though Ahaz hath taken a portion `out' of the house of Jehovah, and `out' of the house of the king, and of the princes, and giveth to the king of Asshur, yet it is no help to him."
14028022,14,28,22,"And in the time of his distress -- he addeth to trespass against Jehovah, (this king Ahaz),"
14028023,14,28,23,"and he sacrificeth to the gods of Damascus -- those smiting him, and saith, `Because the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, to them I sacrifice, and they help me,' and they have been to him to cause him to stumble, and to all Israel."
14028024,14,28,24,"And Ahaz gathereth the vessels of the house of God, and cutteth in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shutteth the doors of the house of Jehovah, and maketh to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem."
14028025,14,28,25,"And in every city and city of Judah he hath made high places to make perfume to other gods, and provoketh Jehovah, God of his fathers."
14028026,14,28,26,"And the rest of his matters, and all his ways, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14028027,14,28,27,"And Ahaz lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city, in Jerusalem, but have not brought him in to the graves of the kings of Israel, and reign doth Hezekiah his son in his stead."
14029001,14,29,1,"Hezekiah hath reigned -- a son of twenty and five years, and twenty and nine years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother `is' Abijah daughter of Zechariah;"
14029002,14,29,2,"and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father did."
14029003,14,29,3,"He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, hath opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and strengtheneth them,"
14029004,14,29,4,"and bringeth in the priests and the Levites, and gathereth them to the broad place to the east."
14029005,14,29,5,"And he saith to them, `Hear me, O Levites, now, sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, God of your fathers, and bring out the impurity from the sanctuary,"
14029006,14,29,6,"for our fathers have trespassed, and done that which is evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God, and forsake him, and turn round their faces from the tabernacle of Jehovah, and give the neck."
14029007,14,29,7,"`Also -- they have shut the doors of the porch, and quench the lamps, and perfume they have not made, and burnt-offering have not caused to ascend in the sanctuary to the God of Israel,"
14029008,14,29,8,"and the wrath of Jehovah is on Judah and Jerusalem, and He giveth them for a trembling, for an astonishment, and for a hissing, as ye are seeing with your eyes."
14029009,14,29,9,"And lo, fallen have our fathers by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives `are' in captivity for this."
14029010,14,29,10,"`Now -- with my heart -- to make a covenant before Jehovah, God of Israel, and the fierceness of His anger doth turn back from us."
14029011,14,29,11,"My sons, be not now at rest, for on you hath Jehovah fixed to stand before Him, to serve Him, and to be to Him ministering and making perfume.'"
14029012,14,29,12,"And the Levites rise -- Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathite; and of the sons of Merari: Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehalelel; and of the Gershonite: Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;"
14029013,14,29,13,"and of the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri, and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
14029014,14,29,14,and of the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel --
14029015,14,29,15,"and they gather their brethren, and sanctify themselves, and come in, according to the command of the king in the matters of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah,"
14029016,14,29,16,"and the priests come in to the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse `it', and bring out all the uncleanness that they have found in the temple of Jehovah to the court of the house of Jehovah, and the Levites receive `it', to take `it' out to the brook Kidron without."
14029017,14,29,17,"And they begin on the first of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they have come to the porch of Jehovah, and they sanctify the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they have finished."
14029018,14,29,18,"And they come in within unto Hezekiah the king, and say, `We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the arrangement, and all its vessels,"
14029019,14,29,19,"and all the vessels that king Ahaz cast away in his reign -- in his trespass -- we have prepared and sanctified, and lo, they `are' before the altar of Jehovah.'"
14029020,14,29,20,"And Hezekiah the king riseth early, and gathereth the heads of the city, and goeth up to the house of Jehovah;"
14029021,14,29,21,"and they bring in seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven young he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah; and he saith to sons of Aaron, the priests, to cause `them' to ascend on the altar of Jehovah."
14029022,14,29,22,"And they slaughter the oxen, and the priests receive the blood, and sprinkle on the altar; and they slaughter the rams, and sprinkle the blood on the altar; and they slaughter the lambs, and sprinkle the blood on the altar;"
14029023,14,29,23,"and they bring nigh the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the assembly, and they lay their hands upon them;"
14029024,14,29,24,"and the priests slaughter them, and make a sin-offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel, for `For all Israel,' said the king, ``is' the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.'"
14029025,14,29,25,"And he appointeth the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, by the command of David, and of Gad, seer of the king, and of Nathan the prophet, for by the hand of Jehovah `is' the command, by the hand of His prophets;"
14029026,14,29,26,"and the Levites stand with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14029027,14,29,27,"And Hezekiah saith to cause the burnt-offering to ascend on the altar; and at the time the burnt-offering began -- began the song of Jehovah, and the trumpets, even by the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel."
14029028,14,29,28,"And all the assembly are doing obeisance, and the singers singing, and the trumpeters blowing; the whole `is' till the completion of the burnt-offering."
14029029,14,29,29,"And at the completion of the offering up bowed have the king and all those found with him, and do obeisance."
14029030,14,29,30,"And Hezekiah the king saith, and the princes, to the Levites to give praise to Jehovah in the words of David, and of Asaph the seer, and they praise -- unto joy, and they bow, and do obeisance."
14029031,14,29,31,"And Hezekiah answereth and saith, `Now ye have filled your hand to Jehovah, come nigh, and bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings to the house of Jehovah;' and the assembly bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings, and every willing-hearted one -- burnt-offerings."
14029032,14,29,32,"And the number of the burnt-offerings that the assembly have brought in, is seventy oxen, a hundred rams, lambs two hundred; for a burnt-offering to Jehovah `are' all these."
14029033,14,29,33,"And the sanctified things `are' oxen six hundred, and sheep three thousand."
14029034,14,29,34,"Only, the priests have become few, and have not been able to strip the whole of the burnt-offerings, and their brethren the Levites strengthen them till the completion of the work, and till the priests sanctify themselves, for the Levites `are' more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."
14029035,14,29,35,"And also, burnt-offerings `are' in abundance, with fat of the peace-offerings, and with oblations for the burnt-offering; and the service of the house of Jehovah is established,"
14029036,14,29,36,"and rejoice doth Hezekiah and all the people, because of God's giving preparation to the people, for the thing hath been suddenly."
14030001,14,30,1,"And Hezekiah sendeth unto all Israel and Judah, and also letters he hath written unto Ephraim and Manasseh, to come in to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel."
14030002,14,30,2,"And the king taketh counsel, and his heads, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to make the passover in the second month,"
14030003,14,30,3,"for they have not been able to make it at that time, for the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, and the people have not been gathered to Jerusalem."
14030004,14,30,4,"And the thing is right in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the assembly,"
14030005,14,30,5,"and they establish the thing, to cause to pass over an intimation into all Israel, from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, to come in to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel, in Jerusalem, for not for a long time had they done as it is written."
14030006,14,30,6,"And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the command of the king, saying, `O sons of Israel, turn back unto Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He doth turn back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of the kings of Asshur;"
14030007,14,30,7,"and do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, God of their fathers, and He giveth them to desolation, as ye do see."
14030008,14,30,8,"`Now, harden not your neck like your fathers, give a hand to Jehovah, and come in to His sanctuary, that He hath sanctified to the age, and serve Jehovah your God, and the fierceness of His anger doth turn back from you;"
14030009,14,30,9,"for in your turning back unto Jehovah, your brethren and your sons have mercies before their captors, even to return to this land, for gracious and merciful `is' Jehovah your God, and He doth not turn aside the face from you, if ye turn back unto Him.'"
14030010,14,30,10,"And the runners are passing over from city to city, in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: and they are laughing at them, and mocking at them,"
14030011,14,30,11,"only, certain from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun, have been humbled, and come in to Jerusalem."
14030012,14,30,12,"Also, in Judah hath the hand of God been to give to them one heart to do the command of the king and of the heads, in the matter of Jehovah;"
14030013,14,30,13,"and much people are gathered to Jerusalem, to make the feast of unleavened things in the second month -- a mighty assembly for multitude."
14030014,14,30,14,"And they arise and turn aside the altars that `are' in Jerusalem, and all the perfume altars they have turned aside, and cast `them' to the brook Kidron;"
14030015,14,30,15,"and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the second month, and the priests and the Levites have been ashamed, and sanctify themselves, and bring in burnt-offerings to the house of Jehovah."
14030016,14,30,16,"And they stand on their station according to their ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites,"
14030017,14,30,17,"for many `are' in the assembly who have not sanctified themselves, and the Levites `are' over the slaughtering of the passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify `him' to Jehovah:"
14030018,14,30,18,"for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, `Jehovah, who `is' good, doth receive atonement for every one"
14030019,14,30,19,"who hath prepared his heart to seek God -- Jehovah, God of his fathers -- yet not according to the cleansing of the sanctuary;'"
14030020,14,30,20,"and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the people."
14030021,14,30,21,"And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and giving praise to Jehovah day by day are the Levites and the priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah."
14030022,14,30,22,"And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites, those giving good understanding concerning Jehovah, and they eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, God of their fathers."
14030023,14,30,23,"And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven days, and they keep seven days `with' joy;"
14030024,14,30,24,"for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep; and the heads have presented to the assembly bullocks a thousand, and sheep ten thousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance."
14030025,14,30,25,"And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,"
14030026,14,30,26,"and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in Jerusalem,"
14030027,14,30,27,"and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer cometh in to His holy habitation, to the heavens."
14031001,14,31,1,"And at the completion of all this, gone out have all Israel who are found present to the cities of Judah, and break the standing-pillars, and cut down the shrines, and break down the high places and the altars, out of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, even to completion, and all the sons of Israel turn back, each to his Possession, to their cities."
14031002,14,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointeth the courses of the priests, and of the Levites, by their courses, each according to his service, of the priests and of the Levites, for burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to give praise in the gates of the camps of Jehovah."
14031003,14,31,3,"And a portion of the king, from his substance, `is' for burnt-offerings, for burnt-offerings of the morning, and of the evening, and the burnt-offerings of sabbaths, and of new moons, and of appointed seasons, as it is written in the law of Jehovah."
14031004,14,31,4,"And he saith to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests, and of the Levites, so that they are strengthened in the law of Jehovah;"
14031005,14,31,5,"and at the spreading forth of the thing have the sons of Israel multiplied the first-fruit of corn, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field, and the tithe of the whole in abundance they have brought in."
14031006,14,31,6,"And the sons of Israel and Judah, those dwelling in cities of Judah, they also a tithe of herd and flock, and a tithe of the holy things that are sanctified to Jehovah their God, have brought in, and they give -- heaps, heaps;"
14031007,14,31,7,"in the third month they have begun to lay the foundation of the heaps, and in the seventh month they have finished."
14031008,14,31,8,"And Hezekiah and the heads come in and see the heaps, and bless Jehovah and His people Israel,"
14031009,14,31,9,"and Hezekiah inquireth at the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps,"
14031010,14,31,10,"and Azariah the head priest, of the house of Zadok, speaketh unto him, and saith, `From the beginning of the bringing of the heave-offering to the house of Jehovah, `there is' to eat, and to be satisfied, and to leave abundantly, for Jehovah hath blessed His people, and that left `is' this store.'"
14031011,14,31,11,"And Hezekiah saith to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah, and they prepare,"
14031012,14,31,12,"and they bring in the heave-offering, and the tithe, and the holy things faithfully; and over them is a leader, Conaniah the Levite, and Shimei his brother `is' second;"
14031013,14,31,13,"and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, `are' inspectors under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah leader of the house of God."
14031014,14,31,14,"And Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east, `is' over the willing-offerings of God, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, and the most holy things."
14031015,14,31,15,"And by his hand `are' Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shechaniah, in cities of the priests, faithfully to give to their brethren in courses, as the great so the small,"
14031016,14,31,16,"apart from their genealogy, to males from a son of three years and upward, to every one who hath gone in to the house of Jehovah, by the matter of a day in its day, for their service in their charges, according to their courses;"
14031017,14,31,17,"and the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and of the Levites, from a son of twenty years and upward, in their charges, in their courses;"
14031018,14,31,18,"and to the genealogy among all their infants, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters to all the congregation, for in their faithfulness they sanctify themselves in holiness."
14031019,14,31,19,"And to sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of the suburb of their cities, in every city and city, `are' men who have been defined by name, to give portions to every male among the priests, and to every one who reckoned himself by genealogy among the Levites."
14031020,14,31,20,"And Hezekiah doth thus in all Judah, and doth that which is good, and that which is right, and that which is true, before Jehovah his God;"
14031021,14,31,21,"and in every work that he hath begun for the service of the house of God, and for the law, and for the command, to seek to his God, with all his heart he hath wrought and prospered."
14032001,14,32,1,"After these things and this truth, come hath Sennacherib king of Asshur, yea, he cometh in to Judah, and encampeth against the cities of the bulwarks, and saith to rend them unto himself."
14032002,14,32,2,"And Hezekiah seeth that Sennacherib hath come, and his face `is' to the battle against Jerusalem,"
14032003,14,32,3,"and he taketh counsel with his heads and his mighty ones, to stop the waters of the fountains that `are' at the outside of the city -- and they help him,"
14032004,14,32,4,"and much people are gathered, and they stop all the fountains and the brook that is rushing into the midst of the land, saying, `Why do the kings of Asshur come, and have found much water?'"
14032005,14,32,5,"And he strengtheneth himself, and buildeth the whole of the wall that is broken, and causeth `it' to ascend unto the towers, and at the outside of the wall another, and strengtheneth Millo, `in' the city of David, and maketh darts in abundance, and shields."
14032006,14,32,6,"And he putteth heads of war over the people, and gathereth them unto him, unto the broad place of a gate of the city, and speaketh unto their heart, saying,"
14032007,14,32,7,"`Be strong and courageous, be not afraid, nor be cast down from the face of the king of Asshur, and from the face of all the multitude that `is' with him, for with us `are' more than with him."
14032008,14,32,8,"With him `is' an arm of flesh, and with us `is' Jehovah our God, to help us, and to fight our battles;' and the people are supported by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah."
14032009,14,32,9,"After this hath Sennacherib king of Asshur sent his servants to Jerusalem -- and he `is' by Lachish, and all his power with him -- against Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah, who `are' in Jerusalem, saying,"
14032010,14,32,10,"`Thus said Sennacherib king of Asshur, On what are ye trusting and abiding in the bulwark, in Jerusalem?"
14032011,14,32,11,"`Is not Hezekiah persuading you, to give you up to die by famine, and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God doth deliver us from the hand of the king of Asshur?"
14032012,14,32,12,"Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places, and His altars, and speaketh to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar ye bow yourselves, and on it ye make perfume?"
14032013,14,32,13,`Do ye not know what I have done -- I and my fathers -- to all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?
14032014,14,32,14,"Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers have devoted to destruction `is' he who hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God is able to deliver you out of my hand?"
14032015,14,32,15,"`And, now, let not Hezekiah lift you up, nor persuade you thus, nor give credence to him, for no god of any nation and kingdom is able to deliver his people from my hand, and from the hand of my fathers: also, surely your God doth not deliver you from my hand!'"
14032016,14,32,16,"And again have his servants spoken against Jehovah God, and against Hezekiah His servant,"
14032017,14,32,17,"and letters he hath written to give reproach to Jehovah, God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, `As the gods of the nations of the lands that have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah doth not deliver His people from my hand.'"
14032018,14,32,18,"And they call with a great voice `in' Jewish, against the people of Jerusalem who `are' on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them, that they may capture the city,"
14032019,14,32,19,and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land -- work of the hands of man.
14032020,14,32,20,"And Hezekiah the king prayeth, and Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, concerning this, and they cry to the heavens,"
14032021,14,32,21,"and Jehovah sendeth a messenger, and cutteth off every mighty one of valour -- both leader and head -- in the camp of the king of Asshur, and he turneth back with shame of face to his land, and entereth the house of his god, and those coming out of his bowels have caused him to fall there by the sword."
14032022,14,32,22,"And Jehovah saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from the hand of all, and He leadeth them round about;"
14032023,14,32,23,"and many are bringing in an offering to Jehovah, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, and he is lifted up before the eyes of all the nations after this."
14032024,14,32,24,"In those days hath Hezekiah been sick even unto death, and he prayeth unto Jehovah, and He speaketh to him, and a wonder hath appointed for him;"
14032025,14,32,25,"and Hezekiah hath not returned according to the deed `done' unto him, for his heart hath been lofty, and there is wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem;"
14032026,14,32,26,"and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah hath not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah."
14032027,14,32,27,"And Hezekiah hath riches and honour very much, and treasures he hath made to himself of silver, and of gold, and of precious stone, and of spices, and of shields, and of all `kinds' of desirable vessels,"
14032028,14,32,28,"and storehouses for the increase of corn, and new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and herds for stalls;"
14032029,14,32,29,"and cities he hath made for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God hath given to him very much substance."
14032030,14,32,30,"And Hezekiah himself hath stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon, and directeth them beneath to the west of the city of David, and Hezekiah prospereth in all his work;"
14032031,14,32,31,"and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon, those sending unto him to inquire of the wonder that hath been in the land, God hath left him to try him, to know all in his heart,"
14032032,14,32,32,"And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and his kind acts, lo, they are written in the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14032033,14,32,33,"And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done honour to him at his death, and reign doth Manasseh his son in his stead."
14033001,14,33,1,"A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;"
14033002,14,33,2,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,"
14033003,14,33,3,"and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah his father hath broken down, and raiseth altars for Baalim, and maketh shrines, and boweth himself to all the host of the heavens, and serveth them."
14033004,14,33,4,"And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah of which Jehovah had said, `In Jerusalem is My name to the age.'"
14033005,14,33,5,And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
14033006,14,33,6,"And he hath caused his sons to pass over through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and observed clouds and used enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and a wizard; he hath multiplied to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger."
14033007,14,33,7,"And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in the house of God, of which God said unto David, and unto Solomon his son, `In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name to the age,"
14033008,14,33,8,"and I add not to turn aside the foot of Israel from off the ground that I appointed to your fathers, only, if they watch to do all that I have commanded them -- to all the law, and the statutes, and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.'"
14033009,14,33,9,"And Manasseh maketh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, to do evil above the nations that Jehovah destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel."
14033010,14,33,10,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Manasseh and unto his people, and they have not attended,"
14033011,14,33,11,"and Jehovah bringeth in against them the heads of the host that the king of Asshur hath, and they capture Manasseh among the thickets, and bind him with brazen fetters, and cause him to go to Babylon."
14033012,14,33,12,"And when he is in distress he hath appeased the face of Jehovah his God, and is humbled exceedingly before the God of his fathers,"
14033013,14,33,13,"and prayeth unto Him, and He is entreated of him, and heareth his supplication, and bringeth him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom, and Manasseh knoweth that Jehovah -- He `is' God."
14033014,14,33,14,"And after this he hath built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entering in at the fish-gate, and it hath gone round to the tower, and he maketh it exceeding high, and he putteth heads of the force in all the cities of the bulwarks in Judah."
14033015,14,33,15,"And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger, and the idol, out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and casteth `them' to the outside of the city."
14033016,14,33,16,"And he buildeth the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificeth upon it sacrifices of peace-offerings and thank-offering, and saith to Judah to serve Jehovah, God of Israel;"
14033017,14,33,17,"but still the people are sacrificing in high places, only -- to Jehovah their God."
14033018,14,33,18,"And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the matters of the seers, those speaking unto him in the name of Jehovah, God of Israel, lo, they are `on the book of' the matters of the kings of Israel;"
14033019,14,33,19,"and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he had built high places, and established the shrines and the graven images before his being humbled, lo, they are written beside the matters of Hozai."
14033020,14,33,20,"And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in his own house, and reign doth Amon his son in his stead."
14033021,14,33,21,"A son of twenty and two years `is' Amon in his reigning, and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,"
14033022,14,33,22,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father, and to all the graven images that Manasseh his father had made hath Amon sacrificed, and serveth them,"
14033023,14,33,23,"and hath not been humbled before Jehovah, like the humbling of Manasseh his father, for Amon himself hath multiplied guilt."
14033024,14,33,24,"And his servants conspire against him, and put him to death in his own house,"
14033025,14,33,25,"and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his son to reign in his stead."
14034001,14,34,1,"A son of eight years `is' Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,"
14034002,14,34,2,"and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walketh in the ways of David his father, and hath not turned aside -- right or left."
14034003,14,34,3,"And in the eighth year of his reign (and he yet a youth), he hath begun to seek to the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he hath begun to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images."
14034004,14,34,4,"And they break down before him the altars of the Baalim, and the images that `are' on high above them he hath cut down, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images, he hath broken and beaten small, and streweth on the surface of the graves of those sacrificing to them,"
14034005,14,34,5,"and the bones of the priests he hath burnt on their altars, and cleanseth Judah and Jerusalem,"
14034006,14,34,6,"and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their tools, round about."
14034007,14,34,7,"And he breaketh down the altars and the shrines, and the graven images he hath beaten down very small, and all the images he hath cut down in all the land of Israel, and turneth back to Jerusalem."
14034008,14,34,8,"And in the eighteenth year of his reign, to purify the land and the house he hath sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah head of the city, and Joah son of Johaz the remembrancer, to strengthen the house of Jehovah his God."
14034009,14,34,9,"And they come in unto Hilkiah the high priest, and they give the money that is brought in to the house of God, that the Levites, keeping the threshold, have gathered from the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"
14034010,14,34,10,"and they give `it' into the hand of the workmen, those appointed over the house of Jehovah, and they give it `to' the workmen who are working in the house of Jehovah, to repair and to strengthen the house;"
14034011,14,34,11,"and they give `it' to artificers, and to builders, to buy hewn stones, and wood for couplings and for beams to the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed."
14034012,14,34,12,"And the men are working faithfully in the business, and over them are appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathite, to overlook; and of the Levites, every one understanding about instruments of song,"
14034013,14,34,13,"and over the burden-bearers, and overseers of every one doing work for service and service; and of the Levites `are' scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers."
14034014,14,34,14,"And in their bringing out the money that is brought in to the house of Jehovah, hath Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by the hand of Moses,"
14034015,14,34,15,"and Hilkiah answereth and saith unto Shaphan the scribe, `A book of the law I have found in the house of Jehovah;' and Hilkiah giveth the book unto Shaphan,"
14034016,14,34,16,"and Shaphan bringeth in the book unto the king, and bringeth the king back word again, saying, `All that hath been given into the hand of thy servants they are doing,"
14034017,14,34,17,"and they pour out the money that is found in the house of Jehovah, and give it into the hand of those appointed, and into the hands of those doing the work.'"
14034018,14,34,18,"And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, `A book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth in it before the king."
14034019,14,34,19,"And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the law, that he rendeth his garments,"
14034020,14,34,20,"and the king commandeth Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, servant of the king, saying,"
14034021,14,34,21,"`Go, seek Jehovah for me, and for him who is left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great `is' the fury of Jehovah that is poured on us, because that our fathers kept not the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written on this book.'"
14034022,14,34,22,"And Hilkiah goeth, and they of the king, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the Second, and they speak unto her thus."
14034023,14,34,23,"And she saith to them, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Say to the man who hath sent you unto me,"
14034024,14,34,24,"Thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am bringing in evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, all the execrations that are written on the book that they read before the king of Judah;"
14034025,14,34,25,"because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me with all the works of their hands, and poured out is My fury upon this place, and it is not quenched."
14034026,14,34,26,"`And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to inquire of Jehovah, thus do ye say unto him: Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, whose words thou hast heard:"
14034027,14,34,27,"Because thy heart `is' tender, and thou art humbled before God in thy hearing His words concerning this place, and concerning its inhabitants, and art humbled before Me, and dost rend thy garments, and weep before Me: even I also have heard -- the affirmation of Jehovah."
14034028,14,34,28,"Lo, I am gathering thee unto thy fathers, and thou hast been gathered unto thy graves in peace, and thine eyes do not look on all the evil that I am bringing upon this place, and upon its inhabitants;' and they bring the king back word."
14034029,14,34,29,"And the king sendeth and gathereth all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem,"
14034030,14,34,30,"and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah, and every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, even all the people, from great even unto small, and he readeth in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Jehovah."
14034031,14,34,31,"And the king standeth on his station, and maketh the covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that are written on this book."
14034032,14,34,32,"And he presenteth every one who is found in Jerusalem and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem do according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
14034033,14,34,33,"And Josiah turneth aside all the abominations out of all the lands that the sons of Israel have, and causeth every one who is found in Israel to serve, to serve Jehovah their God; all his days they turned not aside from after Jehovah, God of their fathers."
14035001,14,35,1,"And Josiah maketh in Jerusalem a passover to Jehovah, and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the first month,"
14035002,14,35,2,"and he stationeth the priests over their charges, and strengtheneth them for the service of the house of Jehovah,"
14035003,14,35,3,"and saith to the Levites -- who are teaching all Israel -- who are sanctified to Jehovah, `Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon son of David king of Israel built; it is not to you a burden on the shoulder. `Now, serve Jehovah your God, and His people Israel,"
14035004,14,35,4,"and prepare, by the house of your fathers, according to your courses, by the writing of David king of Israel, and by the writing of Solomon his son,"
14035005,14,35,5,"and stand in the sanctuary, by the divisions of the house of the fathers of your brethren, sons of the people, and the portion of the house of a father of the Levites,"
14035006,14,35,6,"and slaughter the passover-offering and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.'"
14035007,14,35,7,"And Josiah lifteth up to the sons of the people a flock of lambs and young goats, the whole for passover-offerings, for every one who is found, to the number of thirty thousand, and oxen three thousand: these `are' from the substance of the king."
14035008,14,35,8,"And his heads, for a willing-offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites, have lifted up; Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders in the house of God, to the priests have given for passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred, and oxen three hundred;"
14035009,14,35,9,"and Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, have lifted up to the Levites, for passover-offerings, five thousand, and oxen five hundred."
14035010,14,35,10,"And the service is prepared, and the priests stand on their station, and the Levites on their courses, according to the command of the king,"
14035011,14,35,11,"and they slaughter the passover-offering, and the priests sprinkle out of their hand, and the Levites are striping;"
14035012,14,35,12,"and they turn aside the burnt-offering, to put them by the divisions of the house of the fathers of the sons of the people, to bring near to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses -- and so to the oxen."
14035013,14,35,13,"And they cook the passover with fire, according to the ordinance, and the sanctified things they have cooked in pots, and in kettles, and in pans -- for all the sons of the people."
14035014,14,35,14,"And afterward they have prepared for themselves, and for the priests: for the priests, sons of Aaron, `are' in the offering up of the burnt-offering and of the fat till night; and the Levites have prepared for themselves, and for the priests, sons of Aaron."
14035015,14,35,15,"And the singers, sons of Asaph, `are' on their station, according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun seer of the king, and the gate keepers `are' at gate and gate; it is not for them to turn aside from off their service, for their brethren the Levites have prepared for them."
14035016,14,35,16,"And all the service of Jehovah is prepared on that day, to keep the passover, and to cause to ascend burnt-offering upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of king Josiah."
14035017,14,35,17,"And the sons of Israel who are found make the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened things, seven days."
14035018,14,35,18,"And there hath not been made a passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, and none of the kings of Israel made such a passover as Josiah hath made, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who are found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14035019,14,35,19,In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah hath this passover been made.
14035020,14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah hath prepared the house, come up hath Necho king of Egypt, to fight against Carchemish by Phrat, and Josiah goeth forth to meet him;"
14035021,14,35,21,"and he sendeth unto him messengers, saying, `What -- to me and to thee, O king of Judah? not against thee do I come to-day, but unto the house with which I have war, and God said to haste me; cease for thee from God who `is' with me, and He doth not destroy thee.'"
14035022,14,35,22,"And Josiah hath not turned round his face from him, but to fight against him hath disguised himself, and hath not hearkened unto the words of Necho, from the mouth of God, and cometh in to fight in the valley of Megiddo;"
14035023,14,35,23,"and the archers shoot at king Josiah, and the king saith to his servants, `Remove me, for I have become very sick.'"
14035024,14,35,24,"And his servants remove him from the chariot, and cause him to ride on the second chariot that he hath, and cause him to go to Jerusalem, and he dieth, and is buried in the graves of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem are mourning for Josiah,"
14035025,14,35,25,"and Jeremiah lamenteth for Josiah, and all the singers and the songstresses speak in their lamentations of Josiah unto this day, and set them for a statute on Israel, and lo, they are written beside the lamentations."
14035026,14,35,26,"And the rest of the matters of Josiah, and his kind acts, according as it is written in the law of Jehovah,"
14035027,14,35,27,"even his matters, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14036001,14,36,1,"And the people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and cause him to reign instead of his father in Jerusalem."
14036002,14,36,2,"A son of three and twenty years `is' Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months he hath reigned in Jerusalem,"
14036003,14,36,3,"and turn him aside doth the king of Egypt in Jerusalem, and fineth the land a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold;"
14036004,14,36,4,"and the king of Egypt causeth Eliakim his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem, and turneth his name to Jehoiakim; and Jehoahaz his brother hath Necho taken, and bringeth him in to Egypt."
14036005,14,36,5,"A son of twenty and five years `is' Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah his God;"
14036006,14,36,6,"against him hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and bindeth him in brazen fetters to take him away to Babylon."
14036007,14,36,7,"And of the vessels of the house of Jehovah hath Nebuchadnezzar brought in to Babylon, and putteth them in his temple in Babylon."
14036008,14,36,8,"And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and his abominations that he hath done, and that which is found against him, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, and reign doth Jehoiachin his son in his stead."
14036009,14,36,9,"A son of eight years is Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months and ten days he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah;"
14036010,14,36,10,"and at the turn of the year hath king Nebuchadnezzar sent and bringeth him in to Babylon, with the desirable vessels of the house of Jehovah, and causeth Zedekiah his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem."
14036011,14,36,11,"A son of twenty and one years `is' Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;"
14036012,14,36,12,"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah his God, he hath not been humbled before Jeremiah the prophet `speaking' from the mouth of Jehovah;"
14036013,14,36,13,"and also, against king Nebuchadnezzar he hath rebelled, who had caused him to swear by God, and he hardeneth his neck, and strengtheneth his heart, against turning back unto Jehovah, God of Israel."
14036014,14,36,14,"Also, all the heads of the priests, and the people, having multiplied to commit a trespass according to all the abominations of the nations, and they defile the house of Jehovah that He hath sanctified in Jerusalem."
14036015,14,36,15,"And Jehovah, God of their fathers, sendeth unto them by the hand of His messengers -- rising early and sending -- for He hath had pity on His people, and on His habitation,"
14036016,14,36,16,"and they are mocking at the messengers of God, and despising His words, and acting deceitfully with His prophets, till the going up of the fury of Jehovah against His people -- till there is no healing."
14036017,14,36,17,"And He causeth to go up against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he slayeth their chosen ones by the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and hath had no pity on young man and virgin, old man and very aged -- the whole He hath given into his hand."
14036018,14,36,18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his princes -- the whole he hath brought in to Babylon."
14036019,14,36,19,"And they burn the house of God, and break down the wall of Jerusalem, and all its palaces they have burnt with fire, and all its desirable vessels -- to destruction."
14036020,14,36,20,"And he removeth those left of the sword unto Babylon, and they are to him and to his sons for servants, till the reigning of the kingdom of Persia,"
14036021,14,36,21,"to fulfil the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, till the land hath enjoyed its sabbaths; all the days of the desolation it kept sabbath -- to the fulness of seventy years."
14036022,14,36,22,"And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, at the completion of the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, hath Jehovah waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he causeth an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,"
14036023,14,36,23,"`Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, God of the heavens, given to me, and He hath laid a charge on me to build to Him a house in Jerusalem, that `is' in Judah; who is among you of all His people? Jehovah his God `is' with him, and he doth go up.'"
15001001,15,1,1,"And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, at the completion of the word of Jehovah from the mouth of Jeremiah, hath Jehovah waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he causeth an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,"

15003002,15,3,2,"And rise doth Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and they build the altar of the God of Israel, to cause to ascend upon it burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God."
15003003,15,3,3,"And they establish the altar on its bases, because of the fear upon them of the peoples of the lands, and he causeth burnt-offerings to ascend upon it to Jehovah, burnt-offerings for the morning and for the evening."
15003004,15,3,4,"And they make the feast of the booths as it is written, and the burnt-offering of the day daily in number according to the ordinance, the matter of a day in its day;"

15003006,15,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month they have begun to cause burnt-offerings to ascend to Jehovah, and the temple of Jehovah hath not been founded,"
15003007,15,3,7,"and they give money to hewers and to artificers, and food, and drink, and oil to Zidonians and to Tyrians, to bring in cedar-trees from Lebanon unto the sea of Joppa, according to the permission of Cyrus king of Persia concerning them."
15003008,15,3,8,"And in the second year of their coming in unto the house of God, to Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those coming from the captivity to Jerusalem, and they appoint the Levites from a son of twenty years and upward, to overlook the work of the house of Jehovah."
15003009,15,3,9,"And Jeshua standeth, `and' his sons, and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, sons of Judah together, to overlook those doing the work in the house of God; the sons of Henadad, `and' their sons and their brethren the Levites."
15003010,15,3,10,"And those building have founded the temple of Jehovah, and they appoint the priests, clothed, with trumpets, and the Levites, sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, by means of `the instruments of' David king of Israel."
15003011,15,3,11,"And they respond in praising and in giving thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age His kindness `is' over Israel, and all the people have shouted -- a great shout -- in giving praise to Jehovah, because the house of Jehovah hath been founded."
15003012,15,3,12,"And many of the priests, and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers, the aged men who had seen the first house -- in this house being founded before their eyes -- are weeping with a loud voice, and many with a shout, in joy, lifting up the voice;"
15003013,15,3,13,"and the people are not discerning the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people are shouting -- a great shout -- and the noise hath been heard unto a distance."
15004001,15,4,1,"And adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear that the sons of the captivity are building a temple to Jehovah, God of Israel,"
15004002,15,4,2,"and they draw nigh unto Zerubbabel, and unto heads of the fathers, and say to them, `Let us build with you; for, like you, we seek to your God, and we are not sacrificing since the days of Esar-Haddon king of Asshur, who brought us up hither.'"
15004003,15,4,3,"And Zerubbabel saith to them, also Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel, `Not for you, and for us, to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together do build to Jehovah God of Israel, as the king Cyrus, king of Persia, commanded us.'"
15004004,15,4,4,"And it cometh to pass, the people of the land are making the hands of the people of Judah feeble, and troubling them in building,"
15004005,15,4,5,"and are hiring against them counsellors to make void their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even till the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15004006,15,4,6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the commencement of his reign, they have written an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem;"
15004007,15,4,7,"and in the days of Artaxerxes have Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions written unto Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter is written in Aramaean, and interpreted in Aramaean."
15004008,15,4,8,"Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe have written a letter concerning Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, thus:"
15004009,15,4,9,"Then Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe, and the rest of their companions, Dinaites, and Apharsathchites, Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, (who are Elamites),"
15004010,15,4,10,"and the rest of the nations that the great and honourable Asnapper removed and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, and at such a time:"
15004011,15,4,11,"This `is' a copy of a letter that they have sent unto him, unto Artaxerxes the king: `Thy servants, men beyond the river, and at such a time;"
15004012,15,4,12,"Be it known to the king, that the Jews who have come up from thee unto us, have come in to Jerusalem, the rebellious and base city they are building, and the walls they have finished, and the foundations they join."
15004013,15,4,13,"`Now, be it known to the king, that if this city be builded, and the walls finished, toll, tribute, and custom they do not give; and at length `to' the kings it doth cause loss."
15004014,15,4,14,"Now, because that the salt of the palace `is' our salt, and the nakedness of the king we have no patience to see, therefore we have sent and made known to the king;"
15004015,15,4,15,"so that he doth seek in the book of the records of thy fathers, and thou dost find in the book of the records, and dost know, that this city `is' a rebellious city, and causing loss `to' kings and provinces, and makers of sedition `are' in its midst from the days of old, therefore hath this city been wasted."
15004016,15,4,16,"We are making known to the king that, if this city be builded and the walls finished, by this means a portion beyond the river thou hast none.'"
15004017,15,4,17,"An answer hath the king sent unto Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe, and the rest of their companions who are dwelling in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, `Peace, and at such a time:"
15004018,15,4,18,"The letter that ye sent unto us, explained, hath been read before me,"
15004019,15,4,19,"and by me a decree hath been made, and they sought, and have found that this city from the days of old against kings is lifting up itself, and rebellion and sedition is made in it,"
15004020,15,4,20,"and mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, even rulers over all beyond the river, and toll, tribute, and custom is given to them."
15004021,15,4,21,"`Now, make ye a decree to cause these men to cease, and this city is not builded, till by me a decree is made."
15004022,15,4,22,And beware ye of negligence in doing this; why doth the hurt become great to the loss of the kings?'
15004023,15,4,23,"Then from the time that a copy of the letter of king Artaxerxes is read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they have gone in haste to Jerusalem, unto the Jews, and caused them to cease by force and strength;"
15004024,15,4,24,"then ceased the service of the house of God that `is' in Jerusalem, and it ceased till the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15005001,15,5,1,"And prophesied have the prophets, (Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo) unto the Jews who `are' in Judah and in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel -- unto them."
15005002,15,5,2,"Then have Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, risen, and begun to build the house of God, that `is' in Jerusalem, and with them are the prophets of God supporting them."
15005003,15,5,3,"At that time come to them hath Tatnai, governor beyond the river, and Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, and thus they are saying to them, `Who hath made for you a decree this house to build, and this wall to finish?'"
15005004,15,5,4,"Then thus we have said to them, `What `are' the names of the men who are building this building?'"
15005005,15,5,5,"And the eye of their God hath been upon the elders of the Jews, and they have not caused them to cease till the matter goeth to Darius, and then they send back a letter concerning this thing."
15005006,15,5,6,"The copy of a letter that Tatnai, governor beyond the river, hath sent, and Shethar-Boznai and his companions, the Apharsachites who `are' beyond the river, unto Darius the king."
15005007,15,5,7,"A letter they have sent unto him, and thus is it written in it:"
15005008,15,5,8,"`To Darius the king, all peace! be it known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the great house of God, and it is built `with' rolled stones, and wood is placed in the walls, and this work is done speedily, and prospering in their hand."
15005009,15,5,9,"Then we have asked of these elders, thus we have said to them, Who hath made for you a decree this house to build, and this wall to finish?"
15005010,15,5,10,"And also their names we have asked of them, to let thee know, that we might write the names of the men who `are' at their head."
15005011,15,5,11,"`And thus they have returned us word, saying, We `are' servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built many years before this, that a great king of Israel built and finished:"
15005012,15,5,12,"but after that our fathers made the God of heaven angry, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Chaldean, and this house he destroyed, and the people he removed to Babylon;"
15005013,15,5,13,"but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God,"
15005014,15,5,14,"and also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken forth out of the temple that `is' in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, them hath Cyrus the king brought forth out of the temple of Babylon, and they have been given to `one', Sheshbazzar `is' his name, whom he made governor,"
15005015,15,5,15,"and said to him, These vessels lift up, go, put them down in the temple that `is' in Jerusalem, and the house of God is builded on its place."
15005016,15,5,16,"Then hath this Sheshbazzar come -- he hath laid the foundations of the house of God that `is' in Jerusalem, and from thence even till now it hath been building, and is not finished."
15005017,15,5,17,"`And now, if to the king it be good, let search be made in the treasure-house of the king, that `is' there in Babylon, whether it be that of Cyrus the king there was made a decree to build this house of God in Jerusalem, and the will of the king concerning this thing he doth send unto us.'"
15006001,15,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and they sought in the house of the books of the treasuries placed there in Babylon,"
15006002,15,6,2,"and there hath been found at Achmetha, in a palace that `is' in the province of Media, a roll, and a record thus written within it `is':"
15006003,15,6,3,"`In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king hath made a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: the house let be builded in the place where they are sacrificing sacrifices, and its foundations strongly laid; its height sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits;"
15006004,15,6,4,"three rows of rolled stones, and a row of new wood, and the outlay let be given out of the king's house."
15006005,15,6,5,"`And also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple that `is' in Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, let be given back, and go to the temple that `is' in Jerusalem, `each' to its place, and put `them' down in the house of God."
15006006,15,6,6,"`Now, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, the Apharsachites, who `are' beyond the river, be ye far from hence;"
15006007,15,6,7,"let alone the work of this house of God, let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God on its place."
15006008,15,6,8,"`And by me is made a decree concerning that which ye do with the elders of these Jews to build this house of God, that of the riches of the king, that `are' of the tribute beyond the river, speedily let the outlay be given to these men, that they cease not;"
15006009,15,6,9,"and what they are needing -- both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil according to the saying of the priests who `are' in Jerusalem -- let be given to them day by day without fail,"
15006010,15,6,10,"that they be bringing near sweet savours to the God of heaven, and praying for the life of the king, and of his sons."
15006011,15,6,11,"`And by me is made a decree, that any one who changeth this thing, let wood be pulled down from his house, and being raised up, let him be smitten on it, and his house let be made a dunghill for this."
15006012,15,6,12,"And God, who caused His name to dwell there, doth cast down any king and people that putteth forth his hand to change, to destroy this house of God that `is' in Jerusalem; I Darius have made a decree; speedily let it be done.'"
15006013,15,6,13,"Then Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king hath sent, so they have done speedily;"
15006014,15,6,14,"and the elders of the Jews are building and prospering through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo, and they have built and finished by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
15006015,15,6,15,"And this house hath gone out till the third day of the month Adar, that is `in' the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
15006016,15,6,16,"And the sons of Israel have made, `and' the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the captivity, a dedication of this house of God with joy,"
15006017,15,6,17,"and have brought near for the dedication of this house of God, bullocks a hundred, rams two hundred, lambs four hundred; and young he-goats for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve, according to the number of the tribes of Israel;"
15006018,15,6,18,"and they have established the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, over the service of God that `is' in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses."
15006019,15,6,19,"And the sons of the captivity make the passover on the fourteenth of the first month,"
15006020,15,6,20,"for the priests and the Levites have been purified together -- all of them `are' pure -- and they slaughter the passover for all the sons of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
15006021,15,6,21,"And the sons of Israel, those returning from the captivity, and every one who is separated from the uncleanness of the nations of the land unto them, to seek to Jehovah, God of Israel, do eat,"
15006022,15,6,22,"and they make the feast of unleavened things seven days with joy, for Jehovah made them to rejoice, and turned round the heart of the king of Asshur unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
15007001,15,7,1,"And after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,"
15007002,15,7,2,"son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,"
15007003,15,7,3,"son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,"
15007004,15,7,4,"son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,"
15007005,15,7,5,"son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the head priest;"
15007006,15,7,6,"Ezra himself hath come up from Babylon, and he `is' a scribe ready in the law of Moses, that Jehovah God of Israel gave, and the king giveth to him -- according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him -- all his request."
15007007,15,7,7,"And there go up of the sons of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king."
15007008,15,7,8,"And he cometh in to Jerusalem in the fifth month, that `is in' the seventh year of the king,"
15007009,15,7,9,"for on the first of the month he hath founded the ascent from Babylon, and on the first of the fifth month he hath come in unto Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him,"
15007010,15,7,10,"for Ezra hath prepared his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do, and to teach in Israel statute and judgment."
15007011,15,7,11,"And this `is' a copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commands of Jehovah, and of His statutes on Israel:"
15007012,15,7,12,"`Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven, and at such a time:"
15007013,15,7,13,"By me hath been made a decree that every one who is willing, in my kingdom, of the people of Israel and of its priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem with thee, doth go;"
15007014,15,7,14,"because that from the king and his seven counsellors thou art sent, to inquire concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem, with the law of God that `is' in thy hand,"
15007015,15,7,15,"and to carry silver and gold that the king and his counsellors willingly offered to the God of Israel, whose tabernacle `is' in Jerusalem,"
15007016,15,7,16,"and all the silver and gold that thou findest in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will offerings of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly, for the house of their God that `is' in Jerusalem,"
15007017,15,7,17,"therefore thou dost speedily buy with this money, bullocks, rams, lambs, and their presents, and their libations, and dost bring them near to the altar of the house of your God that `is' in Jerusalem,"
15007018,15,7,18,"and that which to thee and to thy brethren is good to do with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God ye do.'"
15007019,15,7,19,"`And the vessels that are given to thee, for the service of the house of thy God, make perfect before the God of Jerusalem;"
15007020,15,7,20,"and the rest of the needful things of the house of thy God, that it falleth to thee to give, thou dost give from the treasure-house of the king."
15007021,15,7,21,"`And by me -- I Artaxerxes the king -- is made a decree to all treasurers who `are' beyond the river, that all that Ezra the priest, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, doth ask of you, be done speedily:"
15007022,15,7,22,"Unto silver a hundred talents, and unto wheat a hundred cors, and unto wine a hundred baths, and unto oil a hundred baths, and salt without reckoning;"
15007023,15,7,23,"all that `is' by the decree of the God of heaven, let be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven; for why is there wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons?"
15007024,15,7,24,"`And to you we are making known, that upon any of the priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no authority to lift up."
15007025,15,7,25,"`And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that `is' in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may be judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all knowing the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause to know;"
15007026,15,7,26,"and any who doth not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, speedily is judgment done upon him, whether to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to bonds.'"
15007027,15,7,27,"Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of our fathers, who hath given such a thing as this in the heart of the king, to beautify the house of Jehovah that `is' in Jerusalem,"
15007028,15,7,28,"and unto me hath stretched out kindness before the king and his counsellors, and before all the mighty heads of the king: and I have strengthened myself as the hand of Jehovah my God `is' upon me, and I gather out of Israel heads to go up with me."
15008001,15,8,1,"And these `are' heads of their fathers, and the genealogy of those going up with me, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king, from Babylon."
15008002,15,8,2,From the sons of Phinehas: Gershom; from the sons of Ithamar: Daniel; from the sons of David: Hattush;
15008003,15,8,3,"from the sons of Shechaniah, from the sons of Pharosh: Zechariah, and with him, reckoning themselves by genealogy, of males a hundred and fifty."
15008004,15,8,4,"From the sons of Pahath-Moab: Elihoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred who are males."
15008005,15,8,5,"From the sons of Shechaniah: the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred who are males."
15008006,15,8,6,"And from the sons of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty who are males."
15008007,15,8,7,"And from the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy who are males."
15008008,15,8,8,"And from the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty who are males."
15008009,15,8,9,"From the sons of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen who are males."
15008010,15,8,10,"And from the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty who are males."
15008011,15,8,11,"And from the sons of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight who are males."
15008012,15,8,12,"And from the sons of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten who are males."
15008013,15,8,13,"And from the younger sons of Adonikam -- and these `are' their names -- Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty who are males."
15008014,15,8,14,"And from the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy who are males."
15008015,15,8,15,"And I gather them unto the river that is going unto Ahava, and we encamp there three days; and I consider about the people, and about the priests, and of the sons of Levi I have found none there;"
15008016,15,8,16,"and I send for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, heads, and for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding;"
15008017,15,8,17,"and I charge them for Iddo the head, in the place Casiphia, and put in their mouth words to speak unto Iddo, `and' his brethren the Nethinim, in the place Casiphia, to bring to us ministrants for the house of our God."
15008018,15,8,18,"And they bring to us, according to the good hand of our God upon us, a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel, and Sherebiah, and his sons, and his brethren, eighteen;"
15008019,15,8,19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah, of the sons of Merari, his brethren, and their sons, twenty;"
15008020,15,8,20,"and from the Nethinim, whom David and the heads gave for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim, all of them defined by name."
15008021,15,8,21,"And I proclaim there a fast, by the river Ahava, to afflict ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a right way for us, and for our infants, and for all our substance,"
15008022,15,8,22,"for I was ashamed to ask from the king a force and horsemen to help us because of the enemy in the way, for we spake to the king, saying, `The hand of our God `is' upon all seeking Him for good, and His strength and His wrath `is' upon all forsaking Him.'"
15008023,15,8,23,"And we fast, and seek from our God for this, and He is entreated of us."
15008024,15,8,24,"And I separate from the heads of the priests, twelve, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them of their brethren ten,"
15008025,15,8,25,"and I weigh to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, a heave-offering of the house of our God, that the king, and his counsellors, and his heads, and all Israel -- those present -- lifted up;"
15008026,15,8,26,"and I weigh to their hand, of silver, talents six hundred and fifty, and of vessels of silver a hundred talents, of gold a hundred talents,"
15008027,15,8,27,"and basins of gold twenty, of a thousand drams, and two vessels of good shining brass, desirable as gold."
15008028,15,8,28,"And I say unto them, `Ye `are' holy to Jehovah, and the vessels `are' holy, and the silver and the gold `are' a willing-offering to Jehovah, God of your fathers;"
15008029,15,8,29,"watch, and keep, till ye weigh before the heads of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the fathers of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.'"
15008030,15,8,30,"And the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and of the gold, and of the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
15008031,15,8,31,"And we journey from the river Ahava, on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our God hath been upon us, and He delivereth us from the hand of the enemy and the lier in wait by the way;"
15008032,15,8,32,"and we come in to Jerusalem, and dwell there three days."
15008033,15,8,33,"And on the fourth day hath been weighed the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, unto the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them Jozabad son of Jeshua, and Noadiah son of Binnui, the Levites:"
15008034,15,8,34,"by number, by weight of every one, and all the weight is written at that time."
15008035,15,8,35,"Those coming in of the captives -- sons of the removal -- have brought near burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, bullocks twelve, for all Israel, rams ninety and six, lambs seventy and seven, young he-goats for a sin-offering twelve -- the whole a burnt-offering to Jehovah;"
15008036,15,8,36,"and they give the laws of the king to the lieutenants of the king and the governors beyond the river, and they have lifted up the people and the house of God."
15009001,15,9,1,"And at the completion of these things, drawn nigh unto me have the heads, saying, `The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not been separated from the peoples of the lands, as to their abominations, even the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite,"
15009002,15,9,2,"for they have taken of their daughters to them, and to their sons, and the holy seed have mingled themselves among the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the heads and of the seconds have been first in this trespass.'"
15009003,15,9,3,"And at my hearing this word, I have rent my garment and my upper robe, and pluck out of the hair of my head, and of my beard, and sit astonished,"
15009004,15,9,4,"and unto me are gathered every one trembling at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of the removal, and I am sitting astonished till the present of the evening."
15009005,15,9,5,"And at the present of the evening I have risen from mine affliction, and at my rending my garment and my upper robe, then I bow down on my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God,"
15009006,15,9,6,"and say, `O my God, I have been ashamed, and have blushed to lift up, O my God, my face unto Thee, for our iniquities have increased over the head, and our guilt hath become great unto the heavens."
15009007,15,9,7,"`From the days of our fathers we `are' in great guilt unto this day, and in our iniquities we have been given -- we, our kings, our priests -- into the hand of the kings of the lands, with sword, with captivity, and with spoiling, and with shame of face, as `at' this day."
15009008,15,9,8,"`And now, as a small moment hath grace been from Jehovah our God, to leave to us an escape, and to give to us a nail in His holy place, by our God's enlightening our eyes, and by giving us a little quickening in our servitude;"
15009009,15,9,9,"for servants we `are', and in our servitude our God hath not forsaken us, and stretcheth out unto us kindness before the kings of Persia, to give to us a quickening to lift up the house of our God, and to cause its wastes to cease, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
15009010,15,9,10,"`And now, what do we say, O our God, after this? for we have forsaken Thy commands,"
15009011,15,9,11,"that Thou hast commanded by the hands of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land into which ye are going to possess it, `is' a land of impurity, by the impurity of the people of the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it -- from mouth unto mouth -- by their uncleanness;"
15009012,15,9,12,"and now, your daughters ye do not give to their sons, and their daughters ye do not take to your sons, and ye do not seek their peace, and their good -- unto the age, so that ye are strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given possession to your sons unto the age."
15009013,15,9,13,"`And after all that hath come upon us for our evil works, and for our great guilt (for Thou, O our God, hast kept back of the rod from our iniquities, and hast given to us an escape like this),"
15009014,15,9,14,"do we turn back to break Thy commands, and to join ourselves in marriage with the people of these abominations? art not Thou angry against us -- even to consumption -- till there is no remnant and escaped part?"
15009015,15,9,15,"`O Jehovah, God of Israel, righteous `art' Thou, for we have been left an escape, as `it is' this day; lo, we `are' before Thee in our guilt, for there is none to stand before Thee concerning this.'"
15010001,15,10,1,"And at Ezra's praying, and at his making confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there have been gathered unto him out of Israel an assembly very great -- men and women and children -- for the people have wept, multiplying weeping."
15010002,15,10,2,"And Shechaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answereth and saith to Ezra, `We -- we have trespassed against our God, and we settle strange women of the peoples of the land; and now there is hope for Israel concerning this,"
15010003,15,10,3,"and now, let us make a covenant with our God, to cause all the women to go out, and that which is born of them, by the counsel of the Lord, and of those trembling at the command of our God, and according to law it is done;"
15010004,15,10,4,"rise, for on thee `is' the matter, and we `are' with thee; be strong, and do.'"
15010005,15,10,5,"And Ezra riseth, and causeth the heads of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear to do according to this word -- and they swear."
15010006,15,10,6,"And Ezra riseth from before the house of God, and goeth unto the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib; yea, he goeth there, bread he hath not eaten, and water he hath not drunk, for he is mourning because of the trespass of the removal."
15010007,15,10,7,"And they cause a voice to pass over into Judah and Jerusalem, to all sons of the removal, to be gathered to Jerusalem,"
15010008,15,10,8,"and every one who cometh not in by the third day, according to the counsel of the heads and of the elders, all his substance is devoted, and himself separated from the assembly of the removal."
15010009,15,10,9,"And gathered are all the men of Judah and Benjamin to Jerusalem by the third day, it `is' the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sit in the broad place of the house of God, trembling on account of the matter and of the showers."
15010010,15,10,10,"And Ezra the priest riseth, and saith unto them, `Ye -- ye have trespassed, and ye settle strange women, to add to the guilt of Israel;"
15010011,15,10,11,"and, now, make confession to Jehovah, God of your fathers, and do His good pleasure, and be separated from the peoples of the land, and from the strange women.'"
15010012,15,10,12,"And all the assembly answer and say `with' a great voice, `Right; according to thy word -- on us to do;"
15010013,15,10,13,"but the people `are' many, and `it is' the time of showers, and there is no power to stand without, and the work `is' not for one day, nor for two, for we have multiplied to transgress in this thing."
15010014,15,10,14,"`Let, we pray thee, our heads of all the assembly stand, and all who `are' in our cities, who have settled strange wives, do come in at the times appointed, and with them the elders of city and city, and its judges, till the turning back of the fury of the wrath of our God from us, for this thing.'"
15010015,15,10,15,"Only Jonathan son of Asahel, and Jahaziah son of Tikvah, stood against this, and Meshullam, and Shabbethai the Levite, helped them."
15010016,15,10,16,"And the sons of the removal do so, and Ezra the priest, `and' men, heads of the fathers, for the house of their fathers, are separated, even all of them by name, and they sit on the first day of the tenth month, to examine the matter;"
15010017,15,10,17,and they finish with all the men who have settled strange women unto the first day of the first month.
15010018,15,10,18,"And there are found of the sons of the priests that have settled strange women: of the sons of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah;"
15010019,15,10,19,"and they give their hand to send out their wives, and, being guilty, a ram of the flock, for their guilt."
15010020,15,10,20,And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;
15010021,15,10,21,"and of the sons of Harim: Masseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah;"

15010044,15,10,44,"all these have taken strange women, and there are of them women -- who adopt sons."
16001001,16,1,1,"Words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it cometh to pass, in the month of Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I have been in Shushan the palace,"
16001002,16,1,2,"and come in doth Hanani, one of my brethren, he and men of Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the escaped part that have been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem;"
16001003,16,1,3,"and they say to me, `Those left, who have been left of the captivity there in the province, `are' in great evil, and in reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burnt with fire.'"
16001004,16,1,4,"And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these words, I have sat down, and I weep and mourn `for' days, and I am fasting and praying before the God of the heavens."
16001005,16,1,5,"And I say, `I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God of the heavens, God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His commands,"
16001006,16,1,6,"let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive, and Thine eyes open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I am praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the sons of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and the house of my father have sinned;"
16001007,16,1,7,"we have acted very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments, that Thou didst command Moses Thy servant."
16001008,16,1,8,"`Remember, I pray Thee, the word that Thou didst command Moses Thy servant, saying, Ye -- ye trespass -- I scatter you among peoples;"
16001009,16,1,9,"and ye have turned back unto Me, and kept My commands, and done them -- if your outcast is in the end of the heavens, thence I gather them, and have brought them in unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to tabernacle there."
16001010,16,1,10,"And they `are' Thy servants, and Thy people, whom Thou hast ransomed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand."
16001011,16,1,11,"`I beseech Thee, O Lord, let, I pray Thee, Thine ear be attentive unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto the prayer of Thy servants, those delighting to fear Thy Name; and give prosperity, I pray Thee, to Thy servant to-day, and give him for mercies before this man;' and I have been butler to the king."
16002001,16,2,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the month of Nisan, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, wine `is' before him, and I lift up the wine, and give to the king, and I had not been sad before him;"
16002002,16,2,2,"and the king saith to me, `Wherefore `is' thy face sad, and thou not sick? this is nothing except sadness of heart;' and I fear very much,"
16002003,16,2,3,"and say to the king, `Let the king to the age live! wherefore should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of the graves of my fathers, `is' a waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?'"
16002004,16,2,4,"And the king saith to me, `For what art thou seeking?' and I pray unto the God of the heavens,"
16002005,16,2,5,"and say to the king, `If to the king `it be' good, and if thy servant be pleasing before thee, that thou send me unto Judah, unto the city of the graves of my fathers, and I built it.'"
16002006,16,2,6,"And the king saith to me (and the queen is sitting near him), `How long is thy journey? and when dost thou return?' and it is good before the king, and he sendeth me away, and I set to him a time."
16002007,16,2,7,"And I say to the king, `If to the king `it be' good, letters let be given to me for the governors beyond the River, that they let me pass over till that I come in unto Judah:"
16002008,16,2,8,"and a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the paradise that the king hath, that he give to me trees for beams `for' the gates of the palace that the house hath, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I enter;' and the king giveth to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me."
16002009,16,2,9,"And I come in unto the governors beyond the River, and give to them the letters of the king; and the king sendeth with me heads of a force, and horsemen;"
16002010,16,2,10,"and Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and it is evil to them -- a great evil -- that a man hath come in to seek good for the sons of Israel."
16002011,16,2,11,"And I come in unto Jerusalem, and I am there three days,"
16002012,16,2,12,"and I rise by night, I and a few men with me, and have not declared to a man what my God is giving unto my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there is no beast with me except the beast on which I am riding."
16002013,16,2,13,"And I go out through the gate of the valley by night, and unto the front of the fountain of the dragon, and unto the gate of the dunghill, and I am measuring about the walls of Jerusalem, that are broken down, and its gates consumed with fire."
16002014,16,2,14,"And I pass over unto the gate of the fountain, and unto the pool of the king, and there is no place for the beast under me to pass over,"
16002015,16,2,15,"and I am going up through the brook by night, and am measuring about the wall, and turn back, and come in through the gate of the valley, and turn back."
16002016,16,2,16,"And the prefects have not known whither I have gone, and what I am doing; and to the Jews, and to the priests, and to the freemen, and to the prefects, and to the rest of those doing the work, hitherto I have not declared `it';"
16002017,16,2,17,"and I say unto them, `Ye are seeing the evil that we are in, in that Jerusalem `is' waste, and its gates have been burnt with fire; come and we build the wall of Jerusalem, and we are not any more a reproach.'"
16002018,16,2,18,"And I declare to them the hand of my God that is good upon me, and also the words of the king that he said to me, and they say, `Let us rise, and we have built;' and they strengthen their hands for good."
16002019,16,2,19,"And Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they mock at us, and despise us, and say, `What `is' this thing that ye are doing? against the king are ye rebelling?'"
16002020,16,2,20,"And I return them word, and say to them, `The God of the heavens -- He doth give prosperity to us, and we His servants rise and have built; and to you there is no portion, and right, and memorial in Jerusalem.'"
16003001,16,3,1,"And Eliashib the high priest riseth, and his brethren the priests, and they build the sheep-gate; they have sanctified it, and set up its doors, even unto the tower of Meah they have sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel;"
16003002,16,3,2,and by his hand have men of Jericho built; and by their hand hath Zaccur son of Imri built;

16004001,16,4,1,"And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard that we are building the wall, that it is displeasing to him, and he is very angry and mocketh at the Jews,"
16004002,16,4,2,"and saith before his brethren and the force of Samaria, yea, he saith, `What `are' the weak Jews doing? are they left to themselves? do they sacrifice? do they complete in a day? do they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish? -- and they burnt!'"
16004003,16,4,3,"And Tobiah the Ammonite `is' by him and saith, `Also, that which they are building -- if a fox doth go up, then it hath broken down their stone wall.'"
16004004,16,4,4,"Hear, O our God, for we have been despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, and give them for a spoil in a land of captivity;"
16004005,16,4,5,"and do not cover over their iniquity, and their sin from before Thee let not be blotted out, for they have provoked to anger -- over-against those building."
16004006,16,4,6,"And we build the wall, and all the wall is joined -- unto its half, and the people have a heart to work."
16004007,16,4,7,"And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, that lengthening hath gone up to the walls of Jerusalem, that the breeches have begun to be stopped, then it is very displeasing to them,"
16004008,16,4,8,"and they conspire, all of them together, to come in to fight against Jerusalem, and to do to it injury."
16004009,16,4,9,"And we pray unto our God, and appoint a watch against them, by day and by night, because of them."
16004010,16,4,10,"And Judah saith, `The power of the burden-bearers hath become feeble, and the rubbish `is' abundant, and we are not able to build on the wall.'"
16004011,16,4,11,"And our adversaries say, `They do not know, nor see, till that we come in to their midst, and have slain them, and caused the work to cease.'"
16004012,16,4,12,"And it cometh to pass, when the Jews have come who are dwelling near them, that they say to us ten times from all the places whither ye return -- `they are' against us."
16004013,16,4,13,"And I appoint at the lowest of the places, at the back of the wall, in the clear places, yea, I appoint the people, by their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
16004014,16,4,14,"And I see, and rise up, and say unto the freemen, and unto the prefects, and unto the rest of the people, `Be not afraid of them; the Lord, the great and the fearful, remember ye, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.'"
16004015,16,4,15,"And it cometh to pass, when our enemies have heard that it hath been known to us, and God doth frustrate their counsel, and we turn back, all of us, unto the wall, each unto his work;"
16004016,16,4,16,"yea, it cometh to pass, from that day, half of my servants are working in the business, and half of them are keeping hold of both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the heads `are' behind all the house of Judah."
16004017,16,4,17,"The builders on the wall, and the bearers of the burden, those lading, `each' with one of his hands is working in the business, and one is laying hold of the missile."
16004018,16,4,18,"And the builders `are' each with his sword, girded on his loins, and building, and he who is blowing with a trumpet `is' beside me."
16004019,16,4,19,"And I say unto the freemen, and unto the prefects, and unto the rest of the people, `The work is abundant, and large, and we are separated on the wall, far off one from another;"
16004020,16,4,20,in the place that ye hear the voice of the trumpet thither ye are gathered unto us; our God doth fight for us.'
16004021,16,4,21,"And we are working in the business, and half of them are keeping hold of the spears, from the going up of the dawn till the coming forth of the stars."
16004022,16,4,22,"Also, at that time I said to the people, `Let each with his servant lodge in the midst of Jerusalem, and they have been to us by night a guard, and by day `for' the work:'"
16004023,16,4,23,"and there are none -- I and my brethren and my servants, the men of the guard who `are' after me -- there are none of us putting off our garments, each `hath' his vessel of water."
16005001,16,5,1,"And there is a great cry of the people and their wives, concerning their brethren the Jews,"
16005002,16,5,2,"yea, there are who are saying, `Our sons, and our daughters, we -- are many, and we receive corn, and eat, and live.'"
16005003,16,5,3,"And there are who are saying, `Our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, we are pledging, and we receive corn for the famine.'"
16005004,16,5,4,"And there are who are saying, `We have borrowed money for the tribute of the king, `on' our fields, and our vineyards;"
16005005,16,5,5,"and now, as the flesh of our brethren `is' our flesh, as their sons `are' our sons, and lo, we are subduing our sons and our daughters for servants, and there are of our daughters subdued, and our hand hath no might, and our fields and our vineyards `are' to others.'"
16005006,16,5,6,"And it is very displeasing to me when I have heard their cry and these words,"
16005007,16,5,7,"and my heart reigneth over me, and I strive with the freemen, and with the prefects, and say to them, `Usury one upon another ye are exacting;' and I set against them a great assembly,"
16005008,16,5,8,"and say to them, `We have acquired our brethren the Jews, those sold to the nations, according to the ability that `is' in us, and ye also sell your brethren, and they have been sold to us!' and they are silent, and have not found a word."
16005009,16,5,9,"And I say, `Not good `is' the thing that ye are doing; in the fear of our God do ye not walk, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?"
16005010,16,5,10,"And also, I, my brethren, and my servants, are exacting of them silver and corn; let us leave off, I pray you, this usury."
16005011,16,5,11,"Give back, I pray you, to them, as to-day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, and the hundredth `part' of the money, and of the corn, of the new wine, and of the oil, that ye are exacting of them.'"
16005012,16,5,12,"And they say, `We give back, and of them we seek nothing; so we do as thou art saying.' And I call the priests, and cause them to swear to do according to this thing;"
16005013,16,5,13,"also, my lap I have shaken, and I say, `Thus doth God shake out every man, who doth not perform this thing, from his house, and from his labour; yea, thus is he shaken out and empty;' and all the assembly say, `Amen,' and praise Jehovah; and the people do according to this thing."
16005014,16,5,14,"Also, from the day that he appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes the king -- twelve years -- I, and my brethren, the bread of the governor have not eaten:"
16005015,16,5,15,"the former governors who `are' before me have made themselves heavy on the people, and take of them in bread and wine, besides in silver forty shekels; also, their servants have ruled over the people -- and I have not done so, because of the fear of God."
16005016,16,5,16,"And also, in the work of this wall I have done mightily, even a field we have not bought, and all my servants are gathered there for the work;"
16005017,16,5,17,"and of the Jews, and of the prefects, a hundred and fifty men, and those coming in unto us of the nations that `are' round about us, `are' at my table;"
16005018,16,5,18,"and that which hath been prepared for one day `is' one ox, six fat sheep, also fowls have been prepared for me, and once in ten days of all wines abundantly, and with this, the bread of the governor I have not sought, for heavy is the service on this people."
16005019,16,5,19,"Remember for me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people."
16006001,16,6,1,"And it cometh to pass, when it hath been heard by Sanballat, and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our enemies, that I have builded the wall, and there hath not been left in it a breach, (also, till that time the doors I had not set up in the gates,)"
16006002,16,6,2,"that Sanballat sendeth, also Geshem, unto me, saying, `Come and we meet together in the villages, in the valley of Ono;' and they are thinking to do to me evil."
16006003,16,6,3,"And I send unto them messengers, saying, `A great work I am doing, and I am not able to come down; why doth the work cease when I let it alone, and have come down unto you?'"
16006004,16,6,4,"and they send unto me, according to this word, four times, and I return them `word' according to this word."
16006005,16,6,5,"And Sanballat sendeth unto me, according to this word, a fifth time, his servant, and an open letter in his hand;"
16006006,16,6,6,"it is written in it, `Among the nations it hath been heard, and Gashmu is saying: Thou and the Jews are thinking to rebel, therefore thou art building the wall, and thou hast been to them for a king -- according to these words!"
16006007,16,6,7,"And also, prophets thou hast appointed to call for thee in Jerusalem, saying, A king `is' in Judah, and now it is heard by the king according to these words; and now come, and we take counsel together.'"
16006008,16,6,8,"And I send unto him, saying, `It hath not been according to these words that thou art saying, for from thine own heart thou art devising them;'"
16006009,16,6,9,"for all of them are making us afraid, saying, `Their hands are too feeble for the work, and it is not done;' and now, strengthen Thou my hands."
16006010,16,6,10,"And I have entered the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabeel -- and he is restrained -- and he saith, `Let us meet at the house of God, at the inside of the temple, and we shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming in to slay thee -- yea, by night they are coming in to slay thee.'"
16006011,16,6,11,"And I say, `A man such as I -- doth he flee? and who as I, that doth go in unto the temple, and live? -- I do not go in.'"
16006012,16,6,12,"And I discern, and lo, God hath not sent him, for in the prophecy he hath spoken unto me both Tobiah and Sanballat hired him,"
16006013,16,6,13,"so that he `is' an hireling, that I may fear and do so, and I had sinned, and it had been to them for an evil name that they may reproach me."
16006014,16,6,14,"Be mindful, O my God, of Tobiah, and of Sanballat, according to these his works, and also, of Noadiah the prophetess, and of the rest of the prophets who have been making me afraid."
16006015,16,6,15,"And the wall is completed in the twenty and fifth of Elul, on the fifty and second day;"
16006016,16,6,16,"and it cometh to pass, when all our enemies have heard, and all the nations who are round about us see, that they fall greatly in their own eyes, and know that by our God hath this work been done."
16006017,16,6,17,"Also, in those days the freemen of Judah are multiplying their letters going unto Tobiah, and those of Tobiah are coming in unto them;"
16006018,16,6,18,"for many in Judah are sworn to him, for he `is' son-in-law to Shechaniah son of Arah, and Jehohanan his son hath taken the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah;"
16006019,16,6,19,"also, his good deeds they have been saying before me, and my words they have been taking out to him; letters hath Tobiah sent to make me afraid."
16007001,16,7,1,"And it cometh to pass, when the wall hath been built, that I set up the doors, and the gatekeepers are appointed, and the singers, and the Levites,"
16007002,16,7,2,"and I charge Hanani my brother, and Hananiah head of the palace, concerning Jerusalem -- for he `is' as a man of truth, and fearing God above many --"
16007003,16,7,3,"and I say to them, `Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the heat of the sun, and while they are standing by let them shut the doors, and fasten, and appoint guards of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his guard, and each over-against his house.'"
16007004,16,7,4,"And the city `is' broad on both sides, and great, and the people `are' few in its midst, and there are no houses builded;"
16007005,16,7,5,"and my God putteth it unto my heart, and I gather the freeman, and the prefects, and the people, for the genealogy, and I find a book of the genealogy of those coming up at the beginning, and I find written in it: --"
16007006,16,7,6,"These `are' sons of the province, those coming up of the captives of the removal that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed -- and they turn back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city --"
16007007,16,7,7,"who are coming in with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. Number of the men of the people of Israel:"

16009008,16,9,8,"and didst find his heart stedfast before Thee, so as to make with him the covenant, to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give `it' to his seed. `And Thou dost establish Thy words, for Thou `art' righteous,"
16009009,16,9,9,"and dost see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry hast heard by the sea of Suph,"
16009010,16,9,10,"and dost give signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land, for Thou hast known that they have acted proudly against them, and Thou makest to Thee a name as `at' this day."
16009011,16,9,11,"And the sea Thou hast cleaved before them, and they pass over into the midst of the sea on the dry land, and their pursuers Thou hast cast into the depths, as a stone, into the strong waters."
16009012,16,9,12,"And by a pillar of cloud Thou hast led them by day, and by a pillar of fire by night, to lighten to them the way in which they go."
16009013,16,9,13,"`And on mount Sinai Thou hast come down, even to speak with them from the heavens, and Thou dost give to them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commands."
16009014,16,9,14,"And Thy holy sabbath Thou hast made known to them, and commands, and statutes, and law, Thou hast commanded for them, by the hand of Moses Thy servant;"
16009015,16,9,15,"and bread from the heavens Thou hast given to them for their hunger, and water from a rock hast brought out to them for their thirst, and dost say to them to go in to possess the land that Thou hast lifted up Thy hand to give to them."
16009016,16,9,16,"`And they and our fathers have acted proudly, and harden their neck, and have not hearkened unto Thy commands,"
16009017,16,9,17,"yea, they refuse to hearken, and have not remembered Thy wonders that Thou hast done with them, and harden their neck and appoint a head, to turn back to their service, in their rebellion; and Thou `art' a God of pardons, gracious, and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and hast not forsaken them."
16009018,16,9,18,"`Also, when they have made to themselves a molten calf, and say, this `is' thy god that brought thee up out of Egypt, and do great despisings,"
16009019,16,9,19,"and Thou, in Thine abundant mercies, hast not forsaken them in the wilderness -- the pillar of the cloud hath not turned aside from off them by day, to lead them in the way, and the pillar of the fire by night, to give light to them and the way in which they go."
16009020,16,9,20,"`And Thy good Spirit Thou hast given, to cause them to act wisely; and Thy manna Thou hast not withheld from their mouth, and water Thou hast given to them for their thirst,"
16009021,16,9,21,"and forty years Thou hast nourished them in a wilderness; they have not lacked; their garments have not worn out, and their feet have not swelled."
16009022,16,9,22,"`And Thou givest to them kingdoms, and peoples, and dost apportion them to the corner, and they possess the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16009023,16,9,23,"And their sons Thou hast multiplied as the stars of the heavens, and bringest them in unto the land that Thou hast said to their fathers to go in to possess."
16009024,16,9,24,"`And the sons come in, and possess the land, and Thou humblest before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and givest them into their hand, and their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their pleasure."
16009025,16,9,25,"And they capture fenced cities, and fat ground, and possess houses full of all good, digged-wells, vineyards, and olive-yards, and fruit-trees in abundance, and they eat, and are satisfied, and become fat, and delight themselves in Thy great goodness."
16009026,16,9,26,"`And they are disobedient, and rebel against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and Thy prophets they have slain, who testified against them, to bring them back unto Thee, and they do great despisings,"
16009027,16,9,27,"and Thou givest them into the hand of their adversaries, and they distress them, and in the time of their distress they cry unto Thee, and Thou, from the heavens, dost hear, and, according to Thine abundant mercies, dost give to them saviours, and they save them out of the hand of their adversaries."
16009028,16,9,28,"`And when they have rest, they turn back to do evil before Thee, and Thou dost leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they rule over them; and they turn back, and call Thee, and Thou from the heavens dost hear, and dost deliver them, according to Thy mercies, many times,"
16009029,16,9,29,"and dost testify against them, to bring them back unto Thy law; and they -- they have acted proudly, and have not hearkened to Thy commands, and against Thy judgments have sinned, -- which man doth and hath lived in them -- and they give a refractory shoulder, and their neck have hardened, and have not hearkened."
16009030,16,9,30,"`And Thou drawest over them many years, and testifiest against them by Thy Spirit, by the hand of Thy prophets, and they have not given ear, and Thou dost give them into the hand of peoples of the lands,"
16009031,16,9,31,"and in Thine abundant mercies Thou hast not made them a consumption, nor hast forsaken them; for a God, gracious and merciful, `art' Thou."
16009032,16,9,32,"`And now, O our God -- God, the great, the mighty, and the fearful, keeping the covenant and the kindness -- let not all the travail that hath found us be little before Thee, for our kings, for our heads, and for our priests, and for our prophets, and for our fathers, and for all Thy people, from the days of the kings of Asshur unto this day;"
16009033,16,9,33,"and Thou `art' righteous concerning all that hath come upon us, for truth Thou hast done, and we have done wickedly;"
16009034,16,9,34,"and our kings, our heads, our priests, and our fathers, have not done Thy law, nor attended unto Thy commands, and to Thy testimonies, that Thou hast testified against them;"
16009035,16,9,35,"and they, in their kingdom, and in Thine abundant goodness, that Thou hast given to them, and in the land, the large and the fat, that Thou hast set before them, have not served Thee, nor turned back from their evil doings."
16009036,16,9,36,"`Lo, we -- to-day -- `are' servants, and the land that Thou hast given to our fathers, to eat its fruit and its good -- lo, we `are' servants on it,"
16009037,16,9,37,"and its increase it is multiplying to the kings whom Thou hast set over us in our sins; and over our bodies they are ruling, and over our cattle, according to their pleasure, and we `are' in great distress."

16012029,16,12,29,"and from the house of Gilgal, and from fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for villages have the singers built for themselves round about Jerusalem;"

16012031,16,12,31,"And I bring up the heads of Judah upon the wall, and appoint two great thanksgiving companies and processions. At the right, on the wall, to the dung-gate;"

16012038,16,12,38,"And the second thanksgiving company that is going over-against, and I after it, and half of the people on the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces and unto the broad wall,"
16012039,16,12,39,"and from beyond the gate of Ephraim, and by the old-gate, and by the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, and unto the sheep-gate -- and they have stood at the prison-gate."
16012040,16,12,40,"And the two thanksgiving companies stand in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me,"
16012041,16,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets,"

16012043,16,12,43,"and they sacrifice on that day great sacrifices and rejoice, for God hath made them rejoice `with' great joy, and also, the women and the children have rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem is heard -- unto a distance."
16012044,16,12,44,"And certain are appointed on that day over the chambers for treasures, for heave-offerings, for first-fruits, and for tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for priests, and for Levites, for the joy of Judah `is' over the priests, and over the Levites, who are standing up."
16012045,16,12,45,"And the singers and the gatekeepers keep the charge of their God, even the charge of the cleansing -- according to the command of David `and' Solomon his son,"
16012046,16,12,46,"for in the days of David and Asaph of old `were' heads of the singers, and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God."
16012047,16,12,47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, are giving the portions of the singers, and of the gatekeepers, the matter of a day in its day, and are sanctifying to the Levites, and the Levites are sanctifying to the sons of Aaron."
16013001,16,13,1,"On that day there was read in the book of Moses, in the ears of the people, and it hath been found written in it that an Ammonite and Moabite doth not come into the assembly of God -- unto the age,"
16013002,16,13,2,"because they have not come before the sons of Israel with bread and with water, and hire against them Balaam to revile them, and our God turneth the reviling into a blessing."
16013003,16,13,3,"And it cometh to pass, at their hearing the law, that they separate all the mixed people from Israel."
16013004,16,13,4,"And before this Eliashib the priest, appointed over chambers of the house of our God, `is' a relation of Tobiah,"
16013005,16,13,5,"and he maketh for him a great chamber, and there they were formerly putting the present, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, the new wine, and the oil -- the commanded thing of the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers -- and the heave-offering of the priests."
16013006,16,13,6,"And during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon did I come unto the king, and at the end of days I have asked of the king,"
16013007,16,13,7,"and I come in to Jerusalem, and understand concerning the evil that Eliashib hath done for Tobiah, to make to him a chamber in the courts of the house of God,"
16013008,16,13,8,"and it is very displeasing to me, and I cast all the vessels of the house of Tobiah without, out of the chamber,"
16013009,16,13,9,"and I speak, and they cleanse the chambers, and I bring back thither the vessels of the house of God with the present and the frankincense."
16013010,16,13,10,"And I know that the portions of the Levites have not been given, and they flee each to his field -- the Levites and the singers, doing the work."
16013011,16,13,11,"And I strive with the prefects, and say, `Wherefore hath the house of God been forsaken?' and I gather them, and set them on their station;"
16013012,16,13,12,"and all Judah have brought in the tithe of the corn, and of the new wine, and of the oil, to the treasuries."
16013013,16,13,13,"And I appoint treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites; and by their hand `is' Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for stedfast they have been reckoned, and on them `it is' to give a portion to their brethren."
16013014,16,13,14,"Be mindful of me, O my God, for this, and do not blot out my kind acts that I have done, for the house of my God, and for its charges."
16013015,16,13,15,"In those days I have seen in Judah those treading wine-vats on sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and lading on the asses, and also, wine, grapes, and figs, and every burden, yea, they are bringing in to Jerusalem on the sabbath-day, and I testify in the day of their selling provision."
16013016,16,13,16,"And the Tyrians have dwelt in it, bringing in fish, and every ware, and selling on sabbath to the sons of Judah and in Jerusalem."
16013017,16,13,17,"And I strive with the freemen of Judah, and say to them, `What `is' this evil thing that ye are doing, and polluting the sabbath-day?"
16013018,16,13,18,"Thus did not your fathers do? and our God bringeth in on us all this evil, and on this city, and ye are adding fierceness on Israel, to pollute the sabbath.'"
16013019,16,13,19,"And it cometh to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem have been dark before the sabbath, that I speak, and the doors are shut, and I say, that they do not open them till after the sabbath; and of my servants I have stationed at the gates; there doth not come in a burden on the sabbath-day."
16013020,16,13,20,"And they lodge -- the merchants and sellers of all ware -- at the outside of Jerusalem, once or twice,"
16013021,16,13,21,"and I testify against them, and say unto them, `Wherefore are ye lodging over-against the wall? if ye repeat `it', a hand I put forth upon you;' from that time they have not come in on the sabbath."
16013022,16,13,22,"And I say to the Levites, that they be cleansed, and, coming in, keeping the gates, to sanctify the sabbath-day. Also, this, remember for me, O my God, and have pity on me, according to the abundance of Thy kindness."
16013023,16,13,23,"Also, in those days, I have seen the Jews `who' have settled women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab."
16013024,16,13,24,"And of their sons, half are speaking Ashdoditish -- and are not knowing to speak Jewish -- and according to the language of people and people."
16013025,16,13,25,"And I strive with them, and declare them vile, and smite certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and cause them to swear by God, `Ye do not give your daughters to their sons, nor do ye take of their daughters to your sons, and to yourselves."
16013026,16,13,26,"`By these did not Solomon king of Israel sin? and among the many nations there was no king like him, and beloved by his God he was, and God maketh him king over all Israel -- even him did the strange women cause to sin."
16013027,16,13,27,"And to you do we hearken to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God, to settle strange women?'"
16013028,16,13,28,"And `one' of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest, `is' son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, and I cause him to flee from off me."
16013029,16,13,29,"Be mindful of them, O my God, for the redeemed of the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16013030,16,13,30,"And I have cleansed them from every stranger, and appoint charges to priests and to Levites, each in his work,"
16013031,16,13,31,"and for the wood-offering at appointed times, and for first-fruits. Be mindful of me, O my God, for good."
17001001,17,1,1,"And it cometh to pass, in the days of Ahasuerus -- he `is' Ahasuerus who is reigning from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and twenty and a hundred provinces --"
17001002,17,1,2,"in those days, at the sitting of the king Ahasuerus on the throne of his kingdom, that `is' in Shushan the palace,"
17001003,17,1,3,"in the third year of his reign, he hath made a banquet to all his heads and his servants; of the force of Persia and Media, the chiefs and heads of the provinces `are' before him,"
17001004,17,1,4,"in his shewing the wealth of the honour of his kingdom, and the glory of the beauty of his greatness, many days -- eighty and a hundred days."
17001005,17,1,5,"And at the fulness of these days hath the king made to all the people who are found in Shushan the palace, from great even unto small, a banquet, seven days, in the court of the garden of the house of the king --"
17001006,17,1,6,"white linen, white cotton, and blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on rings of silver, and pillars of marble, couches of gold, and of silver, on a pavement of smaragdus, and white marble, and mother-of-pearl, and black marble --"
17001007,17,1,7,"and the giving of drink in vessels of gold, and the vessels `are' divers vessels, and the royal wine `is' abundant, as a memorial of the king."
17001008,17,1,8,"And the drinking `is' according to law, none is pressing, for so hath the king appointed for every chief one of his house, to do according to the pleasure of man and man."
17001009,17,1,9,"Also Vashti the queen hath made a banquet for women, in the royal house that the king Ahasuerus hath."
17001010,17,1,10,"On the seventh day, as the heart of the king is glad with wine, he hath said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who are ministering in the presence of the king Ahasuerus,"
17001011,17,1,11,"to bring in Vashti the queen before the king, with a royal crown, to shew the peoples and the heads her beauty, for she `is' of good appearance,"
17001012,17,1,12,"and the queen Vashti refuseth to come in at the word of the king that `is' by the hand of the eunuchs, and the king is very wroth, and his fury hath burned in him."
17001013,17,1,13,"And the king saith to wise men, knowing the times -- for so `is' the word of the king before all knowing law and judgment,"
17001014,17,1,14,"and he who is near unto him `is' Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven heads of Persia and Media seeing the face of the king, who are sitting first in the kingdom --"
17001015,17,1,15,"`According to law, what -- to do with queen Vashti, because that she hath not done the saying of the king Ahasuerus by the hand of the eunuchs?'"
17001016,17,1,16,"And Memucan saith before the king and the heads, `Not against the king by himself hath Vashti the queen done perversely, but against all the heads, and against all the peoples that `are' in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus;"
17001017,17,1,17,"for go forth doth the word of the queen unto all the women, to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, in their saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen before him, and she did not come;"
17001018,17,1,18,"yea, this day do princesses of Persia and Media, who have heard the word of the queen, say `so' to all heads of the king, even according to the sufficiency of contempt and wrath."
17001019,17,1,19,"`If to the king `it be' good, there goeth forth a royal word from before him, and it is written with the laws of Persia and Media, and doth not pass away, that Vashti doth not come in before the king Ahasuerus, and her royalty doth the king give to her companion who `is' better than she;"
17001020,17,1,20,"and the sentence of the king that he maketh hath been heard in all his kingdom -- for it `is' great -- and all the wives give honour to their husbands, from great even unto small.'"
17001021,17,1,21,"And the thing is good in the eyes of the king, and of the princes, and the king doth according to the word of Memucan,"
17001022,17,1,22,"and sendeth letters unto all provinces of the king, unto province and province according to its writing, and unto people and people according to its tongue, for every man being head in his own house -- and speaking according to the language of his people."
17002001,17,2,1,"After these things, at the ceasing of the fury of the king Ahasuerus, he hath remembered Vashti, and that which she did, and that which hath been decreed concerning her;"
17002002,17,2,2,"and servants of the king, his ministers, say, `Let them seek for the king young women, virgins, of good appearance,"
17002003,17,2,3,"and the king doth appoint inspectors in all provinces of his kingdom, and they gather every young woman -- virgin, of good appearance -- unto Shushan the palace, unto the house of the women, unto the hand of Hege eunuch of the king, keeper of the women, and to give their purifications,"
17002004,17,2,4,"and the young woman who is good in the eyes of the king doth reign instead of Vashti;' and the thing is good in the eyes of the king, and he doth so."
17002005,17,2,5,"A man, a Jew, there hath been in Shushan the palace, and his name `is' Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite --"
17002006,17,2,6,"who had been removed from Jerusalem with the removal that was removed with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed --"
17002007,17,2,7,"and he is supporting Hadassah -- she `is' Esther -- daughter of his uncle, for she hath neither father nor mother, and the young woman `is' of fair form, and of good appearance, and at the death of her father and her mother hath Mordecai taken her to him for a daughter."
17002008,17,2,8,"And it cometh to pass, in the word of the king, even his law, being heard, and in many young women being gathered unto Shushan the palace, unto the hand of Hegai, that Esther is taken unto the house of the king, unto the hand of Hegai, keeper of the women,"
17002009,17,2,9,"and the young woman is good in his eyes, and she receiveth kindness before him, and he hasteneth her purifications and her portions -- to give to her, and the seven young women who are provided -- to give to her, from the house of the king, and he changeth her and her young women to a good `place in' the house of the women."
17002010,17,2,10,"Esther hath not declared her people, and her kindred, for Mordecai hath laid a charge on her that she doth not declare `it';"
17002011,17,2,11,"and during every day Mordecai is walking up and down before the court of the house of the women to know the welfare of Esther, and what is done with her."
17002012,17,2,12,"And in the drawing nigh of the turn of each young woman to come in unto the king Ahasuerus, at the end of there being to her -- according to the law of the women -- twelve months, for so they fulfil the days of their purifications; six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the purifications of women,"
17002013,17,2,13,"and with this the young woman hath come in unto the king, all that she saith is given to her, to go in with her, out of the house of the women, unto the house of the king;"
17002014,17,2,14,"in the evening she hath gone in, and in the morning she hath turned back unto the second house of the women, unto the hand of Shaashgaz eunuch of the king, keeper of the concubines; she cometh not in any more unto the king except the king hath delighted in her, and she hath been called by name."
17002015,17,2,15,"And in the drawing nigh of the turn of Esther -- daughter of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, whom he had taken to him for a daughter -- to come in unto the king, she hath not sought a thing except that which Hegai eunuch of the king, keeper of the women, saith, and Esther is receiving grace in the eyes of all seeing her."
17002016,17,2,16,"And Esther is taken unto the king Ahasuerus, unto his royal house, in the tenth month -- it `is' the month of Tebeth -- in the seventh year of his reign,"
17002017,17,2,17,"and the king loveth Esther above all the women, and she receiveth grace and kindness before him above all the virgins, and he setteth a royal crown on her head, and causeth her to reign instead of Vashti,"
17002018,17,2,18,"and the king maketh a great banquet to all his heads and his servants -- the banquet of Esther -- and a release to the provinces hath made, and giveth gifts as a memorial of the king."
17002019,17,2,19,"And in the virgins being gathered a second time, then Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the king;"
17002020,17,2,20,"Esther is not declaring her kindred and her people, as Mordecai hath laid a charge upon her, and the saying of Mordecai Esther is doing as when she was truly with him."
17002021,17,2,21,"In those days, when Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the king, hath Bigthan been wroth, and Teresh, (two of the eunuchs of the king, the keepers of the threshold,) and they seek to put forth a hand on king Ahasuerus,"
17002022,17,2,22,"and the thing is known to Mordecai, and he declareth `it' to Esther the queen, and Esther speaketh to the king in the name of Mordecai,"
17002023,17,2,23,"and the thing is sought out, and found, and they are hanged both of them on a tree, and it is written in the book of the Chronicles before the king."
17003001,17,3,1,"After these things hath the king Ahasuerus exalted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and lifteth him up, and setteth his throne above all the heads who `are' with him,"
17003002,17,3,2,"and all servants of the king, who `are' in the gate of the king, are bowing and doing obeisance to Haman, for so hath the king commanded for him; and Mordecai doth not bow nor do obeisance."
17003003,17,3,3,"And the servants of the king, who `are' in the gate of the king, say to Mordecai, `Wherefore `art' thou transgressing the command of the king?'"
17003004,17,3,4,"And it cometh to pass, in their speaking unto him, day by day, and he hath not hearkened unto them, that they declare `it' to Haman, to see whether the words of Mordecai do stand, for he hath declared to them that he `is' a Jew."
17003005,17,3,5,"And Haman seeth that Mordecai is not bowing and doing obeisance to him, and Haman is full of fury,"
17003006,17,3,6,"and it is contemptible in his eyes to put forth a hand on Mordecai by himself, for they have declared to him the people of Mordecai, and Haman seeketh to destroy all the Jews who `are' in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus -- the people of Mordecai."
17003007,17,3,7,"In the first month -- it `is' the month of Nisan -- in the twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus, hath one caused to fall Pur (that `is' the lot) before Haman, from day to day, and from month to month, `to' the twelfth, it `is' the month of Adar."
17003008,17,3,8,"And Haman saith to the king Ahasuerus, `There is one people scattered and separated among the peoples, in all provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws `are' diverse from all people, and the laws of the king they are not doing, and for the king it is not profitable to suffer them;"
17003009,17,3,9,"if to the king `it be' good, let it be written to destroy them, and ten thousand talents of silver I weigh into the hands of those doing the work, to bring `it' in unto the treasuries of the king.'"
17003010,17,3,10,"And the king turneth aside his signet from off his hand, and giveth it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary of the Jews;"
17003011,17,3,11,"and the king saith to Haman, `The silver is given to thee, and the people, to do with it as `it is' good in thine eyes.'"
17003012,17,3,12,"And scribes of the king are called, on the first month, on the thirteenth day of it, and it is written according to all that Haman hath commanded, unto lieutenants of the king, and unto the governors who `are' over province and province, and unto the heads of people and people, province and province, according to its writing, and people and people according to its tongue, in the name of the king Ahasuerus it hath been written and sealed with the signet of the king,"
17003013,17,3,13,"and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all provinces of the king, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, from young even unto old, infant and women, on one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it `is' the month of Adar -- and their spoil to seize,"
17003014,17,3,14,"a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples, to be ready for this day."
17003015,17,3,15,"The runners have gone forth, hastened by the word of the king, and the law hath been given in Shushan the palace, and the king and Haman have sat down to drink, and the city Shushan is perplexed."
17004001,17,4,1,"And Mordecai hath known all that hath been done, and Mordecai rendeth his garments, and putteth on sackcloth and ashes, and goeth forth into the midst of the city and crieth -- a cry loud and bitter,"
17004002,17,4,2,"and he cometh in unto the front of the gate of the king, but none is to come in unto the gate of the king with a sackcloth-garment."
17004003,17,4,3,"And in every province and province, the place where the word of the king, even his law, is coming, a great mourning have the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and lamenting: sackcloth and ashes are spread for many."
17004004,17,4,4,"And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs, and declare `it' to her, and the queen is exceedingly pained, and sendeth garments to clothe Mordecai, and to turn aside his sackcloth from off him, and he hath not received `them'."
17004005,17,4,5,"And Esther calleth to Hatach, of the eunuchs of the king, whom he hath stationed before her, and giveth him a charge for Mordecai, to know what this `is', and wherefore this `is'."
17004006,17,4,6,"And Hatach goeth out unto Mordecai, unto a broad place of the city, that `is' before the gate of the king,"
17004007,17,4,7,"and Mordecai declareth to him all that hath met him, and the explanation of the money that Haman said to weigh to the treasuries of the king for the Jews, to destroy them,"
17004008,17,4,8,"and the copy of the writing of the law that had been given in Shushan to destroy them he hath given to him, to shew Esther, and to declare `it' to her, and to lay a charge on her to go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to seek from before him, for her people."
17004009,17,4,9,"And Hatach cometh in and declareth to Esther the words of Mordecai,"
17004010,17,4,10,"and Esther speaketh to Hatach, and chargeth him for Mordecai:"
17004011,17,4,11,"`All servants of the king, and people of the provinces of the king, do know that any man and woman, who cometh in unto the king, unto the inner court, who is not called -- one law `of' his `is' to put `them' to death, apart from him to whom the king holdeth out the golden sceptre, then he hath lived; and I -- I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.'"
17004012,17,4,12,"And they declare to Mordecai the words of Esther,"
17004013,17,4,13,"and Mordecai speaketh to send back unto Esther: `Do not think in thy soul to be delivered `in' the house of the king, more than all the Jews,"
17004014,17,4,14,"but if thou keep entirely silent at this time, respite and deliverance remaineth to the Jews from another place, and thou and the house of thy fathers are destroyed; and who knoweth whether for a time like this thou hast come to the kingdom?'"
17004015,17,4,15,And Esther speaketh to send back unto Mordecai:
17004016,17,4,16,"`Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast for me, and do not eat nor drink three days, by night and by day; also I and my young women do fast likewise, and so I go in unto the king, that `is' not according to law, and when I have perished -- I have perished.'"
17004017,17,4,17,"And Mordecai passeth on, and doth according to all that Esther hath charged upon him."
17005001,17,5,1,"And it cometh to pass on the third day, that Esther putteth on royalty, and standeth in the inner-court of the house of the king over-against the house of the king, and the king is sitting on his royal throne, in the royal-house, over-against the opening of the house,"
17005002,17,5,2,"and it cometh to pass, at the king's seeing Esther the queen standing in the court, she hath received grace in his eyes, and the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre that `is' in his hand, and Esther draweth near, and toucheth the top of the sceptre."
17005003,17,5,3,"And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee Esther, O queen? and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is given to thee.'"
17005004,17,5,4,"And Esther saith, `If unto the king `it be' good, the king doth come in, and Haman, to-day, unto the banquet that I have made for him;'"
17005005,17,5,5,"and the king saith, `Haste ye Haman -- to do the word of Esther;' and the king cometh in, and Haman, unto the banquet that Esther hath made."
17005006,17,5,6,"And the king saith to Esther, during the banquet of wine, `What `is' thy petition? and it is given to thee; and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is done.'"
17005007,17,5,7,"And Esther answereth and saith, `My petition and my request `is':"
17005008,17,5,8,"if I have found grace in the eyes of the king, and if unto the king `it be' good, to give my petition, and to perform my request, the king doth come, and Haman, unto the banquet that I make for them, and to-morrow I do according to the word of the king.'"
17005009,17,5,9,"And Haman goeth forth on that day rejoicing and glad in heart, and at Haman's seeing Mordecai in the gate of the king, and he hath not risen nor moved for him, then is Haman full of fury against Mordecai."
17005010,17,5,10,"And Haman forceth himself, and cometh in unto his house, and sendeth, and bringeth in his friends, and Zeresh his wife,"
17005011,17,5,11,"and Haman recounteth to them the glory of his wealth, and the abundance of his sons, and all that with which the king made him great, and with which he lifted him up above the heads and servants of the king."
17005012,17,5,12,"And Haman saith, `Yea, Esther the queen brought none in with the king, unto the feast that she made, except myself, and also for to-morrow I am called to her, with the king,"
17005013,17,5,13,"and all this is not profitable to me, during all the time that I am seeing Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate of the king.'"
17005014,17,5,14,"And Zeresh his wife saith to him, and all his friends, `Let them prepare a tree, in height fifty cubits, and in the morning speak to the king, and they hang Mordecai on it, and go thou in with the king unto the banquet rejoicing;' and the thing is good before Haman, and he prepareth the tree."
17006001,17,6,1,"On that night hath the sleep of the king fled away, and he saith to bring in the book of memorials of the Chronicles, and they are read before the king,"
17006002,17,6,2,"and it is found written that Mordecai had declared concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs of the king, of the keepers of the threshold, who sought to put forth a hand on king Ahasuerus."
17006003,17,6,3,"And the king saith, `What honour and greatness hath been done to Mordecai for this?' And the servants of the king, his ministers, say, `Nothing hath been done with him.'"
17006004,17,6,4,"And the king saith, `Who `is' in the court?' -- and Haman hath come in to the outer court of the house of the king, to say to the king to hang Mordecai on the tree that he had prepared for him --"
17006005,17,6,5,"and the servants of the king say unto him, `Lo, Haman is standing in the court;' and the king saith, `Let him come in.'"
17006006,17,6,6,"And Haman cometh in, and the king saith to him, `What -- to do with the man in whose honour the king hath delighted?' And Haman saith in his heart, `To whom doth the king delight to do honour more than myself?'"
17006007,17,6,7,"And Haman saith unto the king, `The man in whose honour the king hath delighted,"
17006008,17,6,8,"let them bring in royal clothing that the king hath put on himself, and a horse on which the king hath ridden, and that the royal crown be put on his head,"
17006009,17,6,9,"and to give the clothing and the horse into the hand of a man of the heads of the king, the chiefs, and they have clothed the man in whose honour the king hath delighted, and caused him to ride on the horse in a broad place of the city, and called before him: Thus it is done to the man in whose honour the king hath delighted.'"
17006010,17,6,10,"And the king saith to Haman, `Haste, take the clothing and the horse, as thou hast spoken, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting in the gate of the king; there doth not fall a thing of all that thou hast spoken.'"
17006011,17,6,11,"And Haman taketh the clothing, and the horse, and clothed Mordecai, and causeth him to ride in a broad place of the city, and calleth before him, `Thus it is done to the man in whose honour the king hath delighted.'"
17006012,17,6,12,"And Mordecai turneth back unto the gate of the king, and Haman hath been hastened unto his house mourning, and with covered head,"
17006013,17,6,13,"and Haman recounteth to Zeresh his wife, and to all his friends, all that hath met him, and his wise men say to him, and Zeresh his wife, `If Mordecai `is' of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou art not able for him, but dost certainly fall before him.'"
17006014,17,6,14,"They are yet speaking with him, and eunuchs of the king have come, and haste to bring in Haman unto the banquet that Esther hath made."
17007001,17,7,1,"And the king cometh in, and Haman, to drink with Esther the queen,"
17007002,17,7,2,"and the king saith to Esther also on the second day, during the banquet of wine, `What `is' thy petition, Esther, O queen? and it is given to thee; and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is done.'"
17007003,17,7,3,"And Esther the queen answereth and saith, `If I have found grace in thine eyes, O king, and if to the king `it be' good, let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my request;"
17007004,17,7,4,"for we have been sold, I and my people, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy; and if for men-servants and for maid-servants we had been sold I had kept silent -- but the adversity is not equal to the loss of the king.'"
17007005,17,7,5,"And the king Ahasuerus saith, yea, he saith to Esther the queen, `Who `is' he -- this one? and where `is' this one? -- he whose heart hath filled him to do so?'"
17007006,17,7,6,"And Esther saith, `The man -- adversary and enemy -- `is' this wicked Haman;' and Haman hath been afraid at the presence of the king and of the queen."
17007007,17,7,7,"And the king hath risen, in his fury, from the banquet of wine, unto the garden of the house, and Haman hath remained to seek for his life from Esther the queen, for he hath seen that evil hath been determined against him by the king."
17007008,17,7,8,"And the king hath turned back out of the garden of the house unto the house of the banquet of wine, and Haman is falling on the couch on which Esther `is', and the king saith, `Also to subdue the queen with me in the house?' the word hath gone out from the mouth of the king, and the face of Haman they have covered."
17007009,17,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, saith before the king, `Also lo, the tree that Haman made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, is standing in the house of Haman, in height fifty cubits;' and the king saith, `Hang him upon it.'"
17007010,17,7,10,"And they hang Haman upon the tree that he had prepared for Mordecai, and the fury of the king hath lain down."
17008001,17,8,1,"On that day hath the king Ahasuerus given to Esther the queen the house of Haman, adversary of the Jews, and Mordecai hath come in before the king, for Esther hath declared what he `is' to her,"
17008002,17,8,2,"and the king turneth aside his signet, that he hath caused to pass away from Haman, and giveth it to Mordecai, and Esther setteth Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17008003,17,8,3,"And Esther addeth, and speaketh before the king, and falleth before his feet, and weepeth, and maketh supplication to him, to cause the evil of Haman the Agagite to pass away, and his device that he had devised against the Jews;"
17008004,17,8,4,"and the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre, and Esther riseth, and standeth before the king,"
17008005,17,8,5,"and saith, `If to the king `it be' good, and if I have found grace before him, and the thing hath been right before the king, and I `be' good in his eyes, let it be written to bring back the letters -- a device of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite -- that he wrote to destroy the Jews who `are' in all provinces of the king,"
17008006,17,8,6,for how do I endure when I have looked on the evil that doth find my people? and how do I endure when I have looked on the destruction of my kindred?'
17008007,17,8,7,"And the king Ahasuerus saith to Esther the queen, and to Mordecai the Jew, `Lo, the house of Haman I have given to Esther, and him they have hanged on the tree, because that he put forth his hand on the Jews,"
17008008,17,8,8,"and ye, write ye for the Jews, as `it is' good in your eyes, in the name of the king, and seal with the signet of the king -- for the writing that is written in the name of the king, and sealed with the signet of the king, there is none to turn back.'"
17008009,17,8,9,"And the scribes of the king are called, at that time, in the third month -- it `is' the month of Sivan -- in the three and twentieth of it, and it is written, according to all that Mordecai hath commanded, unto the Jews, and unto the lieutenants, and the governors, and the heads of the provinces, that `are' from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and twenty and a hundred provinces -- province and province according to its writing, and people and people according to its tongue, and unto the Jews according to their writing, and according to their tongue."
17008010,17,8,10,"And he writeth in the name of the king Ahasuerus, and sealeth with the signet of the king, and sendeth letters by the hand of the runners with horses, riders of the dromedary, the mules, the young mares,"
17008011,17,8,11,"that the king hath given to the Jews who `are' in every city and city, to be assembled, and to stand for their life, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy the whole force of the people and province who are distressing them, infants and women, and their spoil to seize."
17008012,17,8,12,"In one day, in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it `is' the month of Adar --"
17008013,17,8,13,"a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples, and for the Jews being ready at this day to be avenged of their enemies."
17008014,17,8,14,"The runners, riding on the dromedary, `and' the mules, have gone out, hastened and pressed by the word of the king, and the law hath been given in Shushan the palace."
17008015,17,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from before the king, in royal clothing of blue and white, and a great crown of gold, and a garment of fine linen and purple, and the city of Shushan hath rejoiced and been glad;"
17008016,17,8,16,"to the Jews hath been light, and gladness, and joy, and honour,"
17008017,17,8,17,"and in every province and province, and in every city and city, the place where the word of the king, even his law, is coming, gladness and joy `are' to the Jews, a banquet, and a good day; and many of the peoples of the land are becoming Jews, for a fear of the Jews hath fallen upon them."
17009001,17,9,1,"And in the twelfth month -- it `is' the month of Adar -- on the thirteenth day of it, in which the word of the king, even his law, hath come to be done, in the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to rule over them, and it is turned that the Jews rule over those hating them --"
17009002,17,9,2,"the Jews have been assembled in their cities, in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to put forth a hand on those seeking their evil, and no man hath stood in their presence, for their fear hath fallen on all the peoples."
17009003,17,9,3,"And all heads of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the governors, and those doing the work that the king hath, are lifting up the Jews, for a fear of Mordecai hath fallen upon them;"
17009004,17,9,4,"for great `is' Mordecai in the house of the king, and his fame is going into all the provinces, for the man Mordecai is going on and becoming great."
17009005,17,9,5,"And the Jews smite among all their enemies -- a smiting of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction -- and do with those hating them according to their pleasure,"
17009006,17,9,6,and in Shushan the palace have the Jews slain and destroyed five hundred men;
17009007,17,9,7,"and Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
17009008,17,9,8,"and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
17009009,17,9,9,"and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,"
17009010,17,9,10,"ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, adversary of the Jews, they have slain, and on the prey they have not put forth their hand."
17009011,17,9,11,"On that day hath come the number of the slain in Shushan the palace before the king,"
17009012,17,9,12,"and the king saith to Esther the queen, `In Shushan the palace have the Jews slain and destroyed five hundred men, and the ten sons of Haman; in the rest of the provinces of the king what have they done? and what `is' thy petition? and it is given to thee; and what thy request again? and it is done.'"
17009013,17,9,13,"And Esther saith, `If to the king `it be' good, let it be given also to-morrow, to the Jews who `are' in Shushan, to do according to the law of to-day; and the ten sons of Haman they hang on the tree.'"
17009014,17,9,14,"And the king saith -- `to be done so;' and a law is given in Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman they have hanged."
17009015,17,9,15,"And the Jews who `are' in Shushan are assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they slay in Shushan three hundred men, and on the prey they have not put forth their hand."
17009016,17,9,16,"And the rest of the Jews, who `are' in the provinces of the king, have been assembled, even to stand for their life, and to rest from their enemies, and to slay among those hating them five and seventy thousand, and on the prey they have not put forth their hand;"
17009017,17,9,17,"on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, even to rest on the fourteenth of it, and to make it a day of banquet and of joy."
17009018,17,9,18,"And the Jews who `are' in Shushan have been assembled, on the thirteenth day of it, and on the fourteenth of it, even to rest on the fifteenth of it, and to make it a day of banquet and of joy."
17009019,17,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, who are dwelling in cities of the villages, are making the fourteenth day of the month of Adar -- joy and banquet, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
17009020,17,9,20,"And Mordecai writeth these things, and sendeth letters unto all the Jews who `are' in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus, who are near and who are far off,"
17009021,17,9,21,"to establish on them, to be keeping the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day of it, in every year and year,"
17009022,17,9,22,"as days on which the Jews have rested from their enemies, and the month that hath been turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to a good day, to make them days of banquet and of joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the needy."
17009023,17,9,23,"And the Jews have received that which they had begun to do, and that which Mordecai hath written unto them,"
17009024,17,9,24,"because Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary of all the Jews, had devised concerning the Jews to destroy them, and had caused to fall Pur -- that `is' the lot -- to crush them and to destroy them;"
17009025,17,9,25,"and in her coming in before the king, he said with the letter, `Let his evil device that he devised against the Jews turn back upon his own head,' and they have hanged him and his sons on the tree,"
17009026,17,9,26,"therefore they have called these days Purim -- by the name of the lot -- therefore, because of all the words of this letter, and what they have seen concerning this, and what hath come unto them,"
17009027,17,9,27,"the Jews have established and received upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all those joined unto them, and it doth not pass away, to be keeping these two days according to their writing, and according to their season, in every year and year;"
17009028,17,9,28,"and these days are remembered and kept in every generation and generation, family and family, province and province, and city and city, and these days of Purim do not pass away from the midst of the Jews, and their memorial is not ended from their seed."
17009029,17,9,29,"And Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, writeth, and Mordecai the Jew, with all might, to establish this second letter of Purim,"
17009030,17,9,30,"and he sendeth letters unto all the Jews, unto the seven and twenty and a hundred provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus -- words of peace and truth --"
17009031,17,9,31,"to establish these days of Purim, in their seasons, as Mordecai the Jew hath established on them, and Esther the queen, and as they had established on themselves, and on their seed -- matters of the fastings, and of their cry."
17009032,17,9,32,"And a saying of Esther hath established these matters of Purim, and it is written in the Book."
17010001,17,10,1,And the king Ahasuerus setteth a tribute on the land and the isles of the sea;
17010002,17,10,2,"and all the work of his strength, and his might, and the explanation of the greatness of Mordecai with which the king made him great, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of Media and Persia?"
17010003,17,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew `is' second to king Ahasuerus, and a great man of the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking good for his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
18001001,18,1,1,"A man there hath been in the land of Uz -- Job his name -- and that man hath been perfect and upright -- both fearing God, and turning aside from evil."
18001002,18,1,2,"And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters,"
18001003,18,1,3,"and his substance is seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred pairs of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a service very abundant; and that man is greater than any of the sons of the east."
18001004,18,1,4,And his sons have gone and made a banquet -- the house of each `in' his day -- and have sent and called to their three sisters to eat and to drink with them;
18001005,18,1,5,"and it cometh to pass, when they have gone round the days of the banquet, that Job doth send and sanctify them, and hath risen early in the morning, and caused to ascend burnt-offerings -- the number of them all -- for Job said, `Perhaps my sons have sinned, yet blessed God in their heart.' Thus doth Job all the days."
18001006,18,1,6,"And the day is, that sons of God come in to station themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary in their midst."
18001007,18,1,7,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence comest thou?' And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to and fro in the land, and from walking up and down on it.'"
18001008,18,1,8,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy heart against My servant Job because there is none like him in the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God, and turning aside from evil?'"
18001009,18,1,9,"And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `For nought is Job fearing God?"
18001010,18,1,10,"Hast not Thou made a hedge for him, and for his house, and for all that he hath -- round about?"
18001011,18,1,11,"The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, and his substance hath spread in the land, and yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike against anything that he hath -- if not: to Thy face he doth bless Thee!'"
18001012,18,1,12,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, all that he hath `is' in thy hand, only unto him put not forth thy hand.' And the Adversary goeth out from the presence of Jehovah."
18001013,18,1,13,"And the day is, that his sons and his daughters are eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born."
18001014,18,1,14,"And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith, `The oxen have been plowing, and the she-asses feeding by their sides,"
18001015,18,1,15,"and Sheba doth fall, and take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare `it' to thee.'"
18001016,18,1,16,"While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith, `Fire of God hath fallen from the heavens, and burneth among the flock, and among the young men, and consumeth them, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare `it' to thee.'"
18001017,18,1,17,"While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith, `Chaldeans made three heads, and rush on the camels, and take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare `it' to thee.'"
18001018,18,1,18,"While this `one' is speaking another also hath come and saith, `Thy sons and thy daughters are eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born."
18001019,18,1,19,"And lo, a great wind hath come from over the wilderness, and striketh against the four corners of the house, and it falleth on the young men, and they are dead, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare `it' to thee.'"
18001020,18,1,20,"And Job riseth, and rendeth his robe, and shaveth his head, and falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance,"
18001021,18,1,21,"and he saith, `Naked came I forth from the womb of my mother, and naked I turn back thither: Jehovah hath given and Jehovah hath taken: let the name of Jehovah be blessed.'"
18001022,18,1,22,"In all this Job hath not sinned, nor given folly to God."
18002001,18,2,1,"And the day is, that sons of God come in to station themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary in their midst to station himself by Jehovah."
18002002,18,2,2,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence camest thou?' And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.'"
18002003,18,2,3,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!'"
18002004,18,2,4,"And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `A skin for a skin, and all that a man hath he doth give for his life."
18002005,18,2,5,"Yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike unto his bone and unto his flesh -- if not: unto Thy face he doth bless Thee!'"
18002006,18,2,6,"And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, he `is' in thy hand; only his life take care of.'"
18002007,18,2,7,"And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smiteth Job with a sore ulcer from the sole of his foot unto his crown."
18002008,18,2,8,"And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it, and he is sitting in the midst of the ashes."
18002009,18,2,9,"And his wife saith to him, `Still thou art keeping hold on thine integrity: bless God and die.'"
18002010,18,2,10,"And he saith unto her, `As one of the foolish women speaketh, thou speakest; yea, the good we receive from God, and the evil we do not receive.' In all this Job hath not sinned with his lips."
18002011,18,2,11,"And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that hath come upon him, and they come in each from his place -- Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite -- and they are met together to come in to bemoan him, and to comfort him;"
18002012,18,2,12,"and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not discerned him, and they lift up their voice and weep, and rend each his robe, and sprinkle dust on their heads -- heavenward."
18002013,18,2,13,"And they sit with him on the earth seven days and seven nights, and there is none speaking unto him a word when they have seen that the pain hath been very great."
18003001,18,3,1,"After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day."
18003002,18,3,2,And Job answereth and saith: --
18003003,18,3,3,"Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.'"
18003004,18,3,4,"That day -- let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it."
18003005,18,3,5,"Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days."
18003006,18,3,6,"That night -- let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come."
18003007,18,3,7,"Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it."
18003008,18,3,8,"Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan."
18003009,18,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of the dawn."
18003010,18,3,10,Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.
18003011,18,3,11,Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!
18003012,18,3,12,"Wherefore have knees been before me? And what `are' breasts, that I suck?"
18003013,18,3,13,"For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept -- then there is rest to me,"
18003014,18,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes for themselves."
18003015,18,3,15,"Or with princes -- they have gold, They are filling their houses `with' silver."
18003016,18,3,16,"(Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants -- they have not seen light.)"
18003017,18,3,17,"There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do the wearied in power."
18003018,18,3,18,"Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard the voice of an exactor,"
18003019,18,3,19,Small and great `are' there the same. And a servant `is' free from his lord.
18003020,18,3,20,"Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the bitter soul?"
18003021,18,3,21,"Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures."
18003022,18,3,22,"Who are glad -- unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave."
18003023,18,3,23,"To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?"
18003024,18,3,24,"For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters `are' my roarings."
18003025,18,3,25,"For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me."
18003026,18,3,26,I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest -- and trouble cometh!
18004001,18,4,1,And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
18004002,18,4,2,Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?
18004003,18,4,3,"Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong."
18004004,18,4,4,"The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen."
18004005,18,4,5,"But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled."
18004006,18,4,6,Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the perfection of thy ways?
18004007,18,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?"
18004008,18,4,8,"As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!"
18004009,18,4,9,"From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed."
18004010,18,4,10,"The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken."
18004011,18,4,11,"An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate."
18004012,18,4,12,"And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it."
18004013,18,4,13,"In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,"
18004014,18,4,14,"Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear."
18004015,18,4,15,"And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;"
18004016,18,4,16,"It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude `is' over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:"
18004017,18,4,17,`Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?
18004018,18,4,18,"Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'"
18004019,18,4,19,"Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation `is' in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)"
18004020,18,4,20,"From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish."
18004021,18,4,21,"Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!"
18005001,18,5,1,"Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?"
18005002,18,5,2,"For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,"
18005003,18,5,3,"I -- I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,"
18005004,18,5,4,"Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer."
18005005,18,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth."
18005006,18,5,6,"For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery."
18005007,18,5,7,"For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly."
18005008,18,5,8,"Yet I -- I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,"
18005009,18,5,9,"Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering."
18005010,18,5,10,"Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places."
18005011,18,5,11,"To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high `in' safety."
18005012,18,5,12,"Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom."
18005013,18,5,13,"Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,"
18005014,18,5,14,"By day they meet darkness, And as night -- they grope at noon."
18005015,18,5,15,"And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,"
18005016,18,5,16,"And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth."
18005017,18,5,17,"Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,"
18005018,18,5,18,"For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal."
18005019,18,5,19,"In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee."
18005020,18,5,20,"In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword."
18005021,18,5,21,"When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh."
18005022,18,5,22,"At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid."
18005023,18,5,23,"(For with sons of the field `is' thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)"
18005024,18,5,24,"And thou hast known that thy tent `is' peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not,"
18005025,18,5,25,"And hast known that numerous `is' Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth;"
18005026,18,5,26,"Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season."
18005027,18,5,27,"Lo, this -- we searched it out -- it `is' right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!"
18006001,18,6,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18006002,18,6,2,"O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed, And my calamity in balances They would lift up together!"
18006003,18,6,3,"For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore my words have been rash."
18006004,18,6,4,"For arrows of the Mighty `are' with me, Whose poison is drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves `for' me!"
18006005,18,6,5,Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his provender?
18006006,18,6,6,Eaten is an insipid thing without salt? Is there sense in the drivel of dreams?
18006007,18,6,7,My soul is refusing to touch! They `are' as my sickening food.
18006008,18,6,8,"O that my request may come, That God may grant my hope!"
18006009,18,6,9,"That God would please -- and bruise me, Loose His hand and cut me off!"
18006010,18,6,10,"And yet it is my comfort, (And I exult in pain -- He doth not spare,) That I have not hidden The sayings of the Holy One."
18006011,18,6,11,What `is' my power that I should hope? And what mine end That I should prolong my life?
18006012,18,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh brazen?
18006013,18,6,13,"Is not my help with me, And substance driven from me?"
18006014,18,6,14,"To a despiser of his friends `is' shame, And the fear of the Mighty he forsaketh."
18006015,18,6,15,"My brethren have deceived as a brook, As a stream of brooks they pass away."
18006016,18,6,16,"That are black because of ice, By them doth snow hide itself."
18006017,18,6,17,"By the time they are warm they have been cut off, By its being hot they have been Extinguished from their place."
18006018,18,6,18,"Turn aside do the paths of their way, They ascend into emptiness, and are lost."
18006019,18,6,19,"Passengers of Tema looked expectingly, Travellers of Sheba hoped for them."
18006020,18,6,20,"They were ashamed that one hath trusted, They have come unto it and are confounded."
18006021,18,6,21,"Surely now ye have become the same! Ye see a downfall, and are afraid."
18006022,18,6,22,"Is it because I said, Give to me? And, By your power bribe for me?"
18006023,18,6,23,"And, Deliver me from the hand of an adversary? And, From the hand of terrible ones ransom me?"
18006024,18,6,24,"Shew me, and I -- I keep silent, And what I have erred, let me understand."
18006025,18,6,25,"How powerful have been upright sayings, And what doth reproof from you reprove?"
18006026,18,6,26,For reproof -- do you reckon words? And for wind -- sayings of the desperate.
18006027,18,6,27,"Anger on the fatherless ye cause to fall, And are strange to your friend."
18006028,18,6,28,"And, now, please, look upon me, Even to your face do I lie?"
18006029,18,6,29,"Turn back, I pray you, let it not be perverseness, Yea, turn back again -- my righteousness `is' in it."
18006030,18,6,30,Is there in my tongue perverseness? Discerneth not my palate desirable things?
18007001,18,7,1,Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?
18007002,18,7,2,"As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,"
18007003,18,7,3,"So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me."
18007004,18,7,4,"If I lay down then I said, `When do I rise!' And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn."
18007005,18,7,5,"Clothed hath been my flesh `with' worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,"
18007006,18,7,6,"My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope."
18007007,18,7,7,"Remember Thou that my life `is' a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good."
18007008,18,7,8,The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes `are' upon me -- and I am not.
18007009,18,7,9,"Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up."
18007010,18,7,10,"He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again."
18007011,18,7,11,"Also I -- I withhold not my mouth -- I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul."
18007012,18,7,12,"A sea-`monster' am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?"
18007013,18,7,13,"When I said, `My bed doth comfort me,' He taketh away in my talking my couch."
18007014,18,7,14,"And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,"
18007015,18,7,15,"And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones."
18007016,18,7,16,"I have wasted away -- not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days `are' vanity."
18007017,18,7,17,What `is' man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?
18007018,18,7,18,"And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?"
18007019,18,7,19,How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.
18007020,18,7,20,"I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself -- and what?"
18007021,18,7,21,"Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me -- and I am not!"
18008001,18,8,1,And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
18008002,18,8,2,Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind -- sayings of thy mouth?
18008003,18,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?
18008004,18,8,4,"If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,"
18008005,18,8,5,"If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,"
18008006,18,8,6,"If pure and upright thou `art', Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness."
18008007,18,8,7,"And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great."
18008008,18,8,8,"For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,"
18008009,18,8,9,"(For of yesterday we `are', and we know not, For a shadow `are' our days on earth.)"
18008010,18,8,10,"Do they not shew thee -- speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?"
18008011,18,8,11,`Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?
18008012,18,8,12,"While it `is' in its budding -- uncropt, Even before any herb it withereth."
18008013,18,8,13,"So `are' the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish,"
18008014,18,8,14,"Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust."
18008015,18,8,15,He leaneth on his house -- and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it -- and it abideth not.
18008016,18,8,16,"Green he `is' before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out."
18008017,18,8,17,"By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for."
18008018,18,8,18,"If `one' doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee!"
18008019,18,8,19,"Lo, this `is' the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.'"
18008020,18,8,20,"Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers."
18008021,18,8,21,"While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,"
18008022,18,8,22,"Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!"
18009001,18,9,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18009002,18,9,2,"Truly I have known that `it is' so, And what -- is man righteous with God?"
18009003,18,9,3,If he delight to strive with Him -- He doth not answer him one of a thousand.
18009004,18,9,4,Wise in heart and strong in power -- Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?
18009005,18,9,5,"Who is removing mountains, And they have not known, Who hath overturned them in His anger."
18009006,18,9,6,"Who is shaking earth from its place, And its pillars move themselves."
18009007,18,9,7,"Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars He sealeth up."
18009008,18,9,8,"Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the heights of the sea,"
18009009,18,9,9,"Making Osh, Kesil, and Kimah, And the inner chambers of the south."
18009010,18,9,10,"Doing great things till there is no searching, And wonderful, till there is no numbering."
18009011,18,9,11,"Lo, He goeth over by me, and I see not, And He passeth on, and I attend not to it."
18009012,18,9,12,"Lo, He snatches away, who bringeth it back? Who saith unto Him, `What dost Thou?'"
18009013,18,9,13,"God doth not turn back His anger, Under Him bowed have proud helpers."
18009014,18,9,14,How much less do I -- I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?
18009015,18,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, I answer not, For my judgment I make supplication."
18009016,18,9,16,"Though I had called and He answereth me, I do not believe that He giveth ear `to' my voice."
18009017,18,9,17,"Because with a tempest He bruiseth me, And hath multiplied my wounds for nought."
18009018,18,9,18,"He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit, But filleth me with bitter things."
18009019,18,9,19,"If of power, lo, the Strong One; And if of judgment -- who doth convene me?"
18009020,18,9,20,"If I be righteous, Mine mouth doth declare me wicked, Perfect I am! -- it declareth me perverse."
18009021,18,9,21,"Perfect I am! -- I know not my soul, I despise my life."
18009022,18,9,22,"It is the same thing, therefore I said, `The perfect and the wicked He is consuming.'"
18009023,18,9,23,"If a scourge doth put to death suddenly, At the trial of the innocent He laugheth."
18009024,18,9,24,"Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth, If not -- where, who `is' he?"
18009025,18,9,25,"My days have been swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have not seen good,"
18009026,18,9,26,"They have passed on with ships of reed, As an eagle darteth on food."
18009027,18,9,27,"Though I say, `I forget my talking, I forsake my corner, and I brighten up!'"
18009028,18,9,28,"I have been afraid of all my griefs, I have known that Thou dost not acquit me."
18009029,18,9,29,I -- I am become wicked; why `is' this? `In' vain I labour.
18009030,18,9,30,"If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with soap my hands,"
18009031,18,9,31,"Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have abominated me."
18009032,18,9,32,"But if a man like myself -- I answer him, We come together into judgment."
18009033,18,9,33,"If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand on us both."
18009034,18,9,34,"He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth not make me afraid,"
18009035,18,9,35,"I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with myself."
18010001,18,10,1,"My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul."
18010002,18,10,2,"I say unto God, `Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive `with' me."
18010003,18,10,3,"Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?"
18010004,18,10,4,Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth -- seest Thou?
18010005,18,10,5,As the days of man `are' Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?
18010006,18,10,6,"That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?"
18010007,18,10,7,"For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand."
18010008,18,10,8,"Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!"
18010009,18,10,9,"Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back."
18010010,18,10,10,Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?
18010011,18,10,11,"Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me."
18010012,18,10,12,Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.
18010013,18,10,13,"And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this `is' with Thee."
18010014,18,10,14,"If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,"
18010015,18,10,15,"If I have done wickedly -- wo to me, And righteously -- I lift not up my head, Full of shame -- then see my affliction,"
18010016,18,10,16,And it riseth -- as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back -- Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.
18010017,18,10,17,"Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare `are' with me."
18010018,18,10,18,"And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me."
18010019,18,10,19,"As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,"
18010020,18,10,20,"Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,"
18010021,18,10,21,"Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,"
18010022,18,10,22,"A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade -- and no order, And the shining `is' as thick darkness.'"
18011001,18,11,1,And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --
18011002,18,11,2,Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?
18011003,18,11,3,"Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!"
18011004,18,11,4,"And thou sayest, `Pure `is' my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.'"
18011005,18,11,5,"And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee."
18011006,18,11,6,"And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, `Some' of thine iniquity."
18011007,18,11,7,By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?
18011008,18,11,8,Heights of the heavens! -- what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! -- what knowest thou?
18011009,18,11,9,"Longer than earth `is' its measure, And broader than the sea."
18011010,18,11,10,"If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?"
18011011,18,11,11,"For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider `it'!"
18011012,18,11,12,"And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born."
18011013,18,11,13,"If thou -- thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,"
18011014,18,11,14,"If iniquity `is' in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents."
18011015,18,11,15,"For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not."
18011016,18,11,16,"For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest."
18011017,18,11,17,"And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest -- as the morning thou art."
18011018,18,11,18,"And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched -- in confidence thou liest down,"
18011019,18,11,19,"And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;"
18011020,18,11,20,"And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope `is' a breathing out of soul!"
18012001,18,12,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18012002,18,12,2,"Truly -- ye `are' the people, And with you doth wisdom die."
18012003,18,12,3,"I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, And with whom is there not like these?"
18012004,18,12,4,"A laughter to his friend I am: `He calleth to God, and He answereth him,' A laughter `is' the perfect righteous one."
18012005,18,12,5,A torch -- despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet.
18012006,18,12,6,"At peace are the tents of spoilers, And those provoking God have confidence, He into whose hand God hath brought."
18012007,18,12,7,"And yet, ask, I pray thee, `One of' the beasts, and it doth shew thee, And a fowl of the heavens, And it doth declare to thee."
18012008,18,12,8,"Or talk to the earth, and it sheweth thee, And fishes of the sea recount to thee:"
18012009,18,12,9,"`Who hath not known in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this?"
18012010,18,12,10,"In whose hand `is' the breath of every living thing, And the spirit of all flesh of man.'"
18012011,18,12,11,Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?
18012012,18,12,12,"With the very aged `is' wisdom, And `with' length of days understanding."
18012013,18,12,13,"With Him `are' wisdom and might, To him `are' counsel and understanding."
18012014,18,12,14,"Lo, He breaketh down, and it is not built up, He shutteth against a man, And it is not opened."
18012015,18,12,15,"Lo, He keepeth in the waters, and they are dried up, And he sendeth them forth, And they overturn the land."
18012016,18,12,16,"With Him `are' strength and wisdom, His the deceived and deceiver."
18012017,18,12,17,"Causing counsellors to go away a spoil, And judges He maketh foolish."
18012018,18,12,18,"The bands of kings He hath opened, And He bindeth a girdle on their loins."
18012019,18,12,19,Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth.
18012020,18,12,20,"Turning aside the lip of the stedfast, And the reason of the aged He taketh away."
18012021,18,12,21,"Pouring contempt upon princes, And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble."
18012022,18,12,22,"Removing deep things out of darkness, And He bringeth out to light death-shade."
18012023,18,12,23,"Magnifying the nations, and He destroyeth them, Spreading out the nations, and He quieteth them."
18012024,18,12,24,"Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land, And he causeth them to wander In vacancy -- no way!"
18012025,18,12,25,"They feel darkness, and not light, He causeth them to wander as a drunkard."
18013001,18,13,1,"Lo, all -- hath mine eye seen, Heard hath mine ear, and it attendeth to it."
18013002,18,13,2,According to your knowledge I have known -- also I. I am not fallen more than you.
18013003,18,13,3,"Yet I for the Mighty One do speak, And to argue for God I delight."
18013004,18,13,4,"And yet, ye `are' forgers of falsehood, Physicians of nought -- all of you,"
18013005,18,13,5,"O that ye would keep perfectly silent, And it would be to you for wisdom."
18013006,18,13,6,"Hear, I pray you, my argument, And to the pleadings of my lips attend,"
18013007,18,13,7,For God do ye speak perverseness? And for Him do ye speak deceit?
18013008,18,13,8,"His face do ye accept, if for God ye strive?"
18013009,18,13,9,"Is `it' good that He doth search you, If, as one mocketh at a man, ye mock at Him?"
18013010,18,13,10,"He doth surely reprove you, if in secret ye accept faces."
18013011,18,13,11,Doth not His excellency terrify you? And His dread fall upon you?
18013012,18,13,12,"Your remembrances `are' similes of ashes, For high places of clay your heights."
18013013,18,13,13,"Keep silent from me, and I speak, And pass over me doth what?"
18013014,18,13,14,Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth? And my soul put in my hand?
18013015,18,13,15,"Lo, He doth slay me -- I wait not! Only, my ways unto His face I argue."
18013016,18,13,16,"Also -- He `is' to me for salvation, For the profane cometh not before Him."
18013017,18,13,17,"Hear ye diligently my word, And my declaration with your ears."
18013018,18,13,18,"Lo, I pray you, I have set in order the cause, I have known that I am righteous."
18013019,18,13,19,Who `is' he that doth strive with me? For now I keep silent and gasp.
18013020,18,13,20,"Only two things, O God, do with me: Then from Thy face I am not hidden."
18013021,18,13,21,"Thy hand put far off from me, And Thy terror let not terrify me."
18013022,18,13,22,"And call Thou, and I -- I answer, Or -- I speak, and answer Thou me."
18013023,18,13,23,How many iniquities and sins have I? My transgression and my sin let me know.
18013024,18,13,24,Why dost Thou hide Thy face? And reckonest me for an enemy to Thee?
18013025,18,13,25,A leaf driven away dost Thou terrify? And the dry stubble dost Thou pursue?
18013026,18,13,26,"For Thou writest against me bitter things, And causest me to possess iniquities of my youth:"
18013027,18,13,27,"And puttest in the stocks my feet, And observest all my paths, On the roots of my feet Thou settest a print,"
18013028,18,13,28,"And he, as a rotten thing, weareth away, As a garment hath a moth consumed him."
18014001,18,14,1,"Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!"
18014002,18,14,2,"As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not."
18014003,18,14,3,"Also -- on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee."
18014004,18,14,4,Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
18014005,18,14,5,"If determined are his days, The number of his months `are' with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;"
18014006,18,14,6,"Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day."
18014007,18,14,7,"For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease."
18014008,18,14,8,"If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,"
18014009,18,14,9,"From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant."
18014010,18,14,10,"And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where `is' he?"
18014011,18,14,11,"Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry."
18014012,18,14,12,"And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep."
18014013,18,14,13,"O that in Sheol Thou wouldst conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me."
18014014,18,14,14,"If a man dieth -- doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come."
18014015,18,14,15,"Thou dost call, and I -- I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire."
18014016,18,14,16,"But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin."
18014017,18,14,17,"Sealed up in a bag `is' my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity."
18014018,18,14,18,"And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place."
18014019,18,14,19,"Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed."
18014020,18,14,20,"Thou prevailest `over' him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away."
18014021,18,14,21,"Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them."
18014022,18,14,22,"Only -- his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.'"
18015001,18,15,1,And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
18015002,18,15,2,Doth a wise man answer `with' vain knowledge? And fill `with' an east wind his belly?
18015003,18,15,3,To reason with a word not useful? And speeches -- no profit in them?
18015004,18,15,4,"Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God."
18015005,18,15,5,"For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile."
18015006,18,15,6,"Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee."
18015007,18,15,7,The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?
18015008,18,15,8,Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?
18015009,18,15,9,"What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou -- and it is not with us?"
18015010,18,15,10,Both the gray-headed And the very aged `are' among us -- Greater than thy father `in' days.
18015011,18,15,11,"Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word `is' with thee,"
18015012,18,15,12,What -- doth thine heart take thee away? And what -- are thine eyes high?
18015013,18,15,13,For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:
18015014,18,15,14,"What `is' man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?"
18015015,18,15,15,"Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes."
18015016,18,15,16,Also -- surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.
18015017,18,15,17,I shew thee -- hearken to me -- And this I have seen and declare:
18015018,18,15,18,Which the wise declare -- And have not hid -- from their fathers.
18015019,18,15,19,"To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:"
18015020,18,15,20,"`All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one."
18015021,18,15,21,"A fearful voice `is' in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him."
18015022,18,15,22,"He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched `is' he for the sword."
18015023,18,15,23,He is wandering for bread -- `Where `is' it?' He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.
18015024,18,15,24,"Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster."
18015025,18,15,25,"For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty."
18015026,18,15,26,"He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields."
18015027,18,15,27,"For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over `his' confidence."
18015028,18,15,28,"And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps."
18015029,18,15,29,"He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance."
18015030,18,15,30,"He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!"
18015031,18,15,31,"Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence."
18015032,18,15,32,"Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green."
18015033,18,15,33,"He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom."
18015034,18,15,34,"For the company of the profane `is' gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery."
18015035,18,15,35,"To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit."
18016001,18,16,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18016002,18,16,2,"I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters `are' ye all."
18016003,18,16,3,Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?
18016004,18,16,4,"I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul's stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head."
18016005,18,16,5,"I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing."
18016006,18,16,6,"If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease -- what goeth from me?"
18016007,18,16,7,"Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,"
18016008,18,16,8,"And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth."
18016009,18,16,9,"His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me."
18016010,18,16,10,"They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves."
18016011,18,16,11,"God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over."
18016012,18,16,12,"At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark."
18016013,18,16,13,"Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall."
18016014,18,16,14,"He breaketh me -- breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one."
18016015,18,16,15,"Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn."
18016016,18,16,16,"My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids `is' death-shade."
18016017,18,16,17,"Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer `is' pure."
18016018,18,16,18,"O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry."
18016019,18,16,19,"Also, now, lo, in the heavens `is' my witness, And my testifier in the high places."
18016020,18,16,20,"My interpreter `is' my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped:"
18016021,18,16,21,"And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend."
18016022,18,16,22,"When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go."
18017001,18,17,1,"My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished -- graves `are' for me."
18017002,18,17,2,If not -- mockeries `are' with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.
18017003,18,17,3,"Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?"
18017004,18,17,4,"For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them."
18017005,18,17,5,"For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed."
18017006,18,17,6,"And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am."
18017007,18,17,7,"And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them."
18017008,18,17,8,"Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up."
18017009,18,17,9,"And the righteous layeth hold `on' his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And -- dumb are they all."
18017010,18,17,10,"Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man."
18017011,18,17,11,"My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!"
18017012,18,17,12,"Night for day they appoint, Light `is' near because of darkness."
18017013,18,17,13,"If I wait -- Sheol `is' my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch."
18017014,18,17,14,To corruption I have called: -- `Thou `art' my father.' `My mother' and `my sister' -- to the worm.
18017015,18,17,15,"And where `is' now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?"
18017016,18,17,16,"`To' the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest."
18018001,18,18,1,And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
18018002,18,18,2,"When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak."
18018003,18,18,3,Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!
18018004,18,18,4,(He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?
18018005,18,18,5,"Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire."
18018006,18,18,6,"The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished."
18018007,18,18,7,"Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel."
18018008,18,18,8,"For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually."
18018009,18,18,9,"Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing."
18018010,18,18,10,"Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path."
18018011,18,18,11,"Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him -- at his feet."
18018012,18,18,12,"Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side."
18018013,18,18,13,"It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born."
18018014,18,18,14,"Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors."
18018015,18,18,15,"It dwelleth in his tent -- out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur."
18018016,18,18,16,"From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop."
18018017,18,18,17,"His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street."
18018018,18,18,18,"They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out."
18018019,18,18,19,"He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings."
18018020,18,18,20,At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.
18018021,18,18,21,"Only these `are' tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known."
18019001,18,19,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18019002,18,19,2,"Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?"
18019003,18,19,3,"These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make yourselves strange to me --"
18019004,18,19,4,"And also -- truly, I have erred, With me doth my error remain."
18019005,18,19,5,"If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide against me my reproach;"
18019006,18,19,6,"Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net against me hath set round,"
18019007,18,19,7,"Lo, I cry out -- violence, and am not answered, I cry aloud, and there is no judgment."
18019008,18,19,8,"My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths darkness He placeth."
18019009,18,19,9,"Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth the crown from my head."
18019010,18,19,10,"He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth like a tree my hope."
18019011,18,19,11,"And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to Him as His adversaries."
18019012,18,19,12,"Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against me their way, And encamp round about my tent."
18019013,18,19,13,"My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me."
18019014,18,19,14,"Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me,"
18019015,18,19,15,"Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon me: An alien I have been in their eyes."
18019016,18,19,16,"To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With my mouth I make supplication to him."
18019017,18,19,17,"My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the sons of my `mother's' womb."
18019018,18,19,18,"Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak against me."
18019019,18,19,19,"Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I have loved, Have been turned against me."
18019020,18,19,20,"To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I deliver myself with the skin of my teeth."
18019021,18,19,21,"Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath stricken against me."
18019022,18,19,22,Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?
18019023,18,19,23,"Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth grant that in a book they may be graven?"
18019024,18,19,24,With a pen of iron and lead -- For ever in a rock they may be hewn.
18019025,18,19,25,"That -- I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last, For the dust he doth rise."
18019026,18,19,26,"And after my skin hath compassed this `body', Then from my flesh I see God:"
18019027,18,19,27,"Whom I -- I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom."
18019028,18,19,28,"But ye say, `Why do we pursue after him?' And the root of the matter hath been found in me."
18019029,18,19,29,"Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious `are' the punishments of the sword, That ye may know that `there is' a judgment."
18020001,18,20,1,And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --
18020002,18,20,2,"Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me."
18020003,18,20,3,"The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:"
18020004,18,20,4,This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?
18020005,18,20,5,"That the singing of the wicked `is' short, And the joy of the profane for a moment,"
18020006,18,20,6,"Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike --"
18020007,18,20,7,"As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: `Where `is' he?'"
18020008,18,20,8,"As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,"
18020009,18,20,9,"The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him."
18020010,18,20,10,"His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth."
18020011,18,20,11,"His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down."
18020012,18,20,12,"Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,"
18020013,18,20,13,"Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,"
18020014,18,20,14,"His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps `is' in his heart."
18020015,18,20,15,"Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out."
18020016,18,20,16,"Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper."
18020017,18,20,17,"He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter."
18020018,18,20,18,"He is giving back `what' he laboured for, And doth not consume `it'; As a bulwark `is' his exchange, and he exults not."
18020019,18,20,19,"For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it."
18020020,18,20,20,For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.
18020021,18,20,21,"There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay."
18020022,18,20,22,In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.
18020023,18,20,23,"It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating."
18020024,18,20,24,"He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass."
18020025,18,20,25,"One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him `are' terrors."
18020026,18,20,26,"All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent."
18020027,18,20,27,"Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him."
18020028,18,20,28,"Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger."
18020029,18,20,29,This `is' the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.
18021001,18,21,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18021002,18,21,2,"Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation."
18021003,18,21,3,"Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking -- ye may deride."
18021004,18,21,4,"I -- to man `is' my complaint? and if `so', wherefore May not my temper become short?"
18021005,18,21,5,"Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth."
18021006,18,21,6,"Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh hath taken fright."
18021007,18,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea, they have been mighty in wealth."
18021008,18,21,8,"Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And their offspring before their eyes."
18021009,18,21,9,"Their houses `are' peace without fear, Nor `is' a rod of God upon them."
18021010,18,21,10,"His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry."
18021011,18,21,11,"They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their children skip,"
18021012,18,21,12,"They lift `themselves' up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of an organ."
18021013,18,21,13,"They wear out in good their days, And in a moment `to' Sheol go down."
18021014,18,21,14,"And they say to God, `Turn aside from us, And the knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired."
18021015,18,21,15,What `is' the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?'
18021016,18,21,16,"Lo, not in their hand `is' their good, (The counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)"
18021017,18,21,17,"How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His anger."
18021018,18,21,18,"They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane hath stolen away,"
18021019,18,21,19,"God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth recompense unto him -- and he knoweth."
18021020,18,21,20,"His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the Mighty he drinketh."
18021021,18,21,21,"For what `is' his delight in his house after him, And the number of his months cut off?"
18021022,18,21,22,"To God doth `one' teach knowledge, And He the high doth judge?"
18021023,18,21,23,"This `one' dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease and quiet."
18021024,18,21,24,"His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones doth moisten."
18021025,18,21,25,"And this `one' dieth with a bitter soul, And have not eaten with gladness."
18021026,18,21,26,"Together -- on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth cover them over."
18021027,18,21,27,"Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me ye do wrongfully."
18021028,18,21,28,"For ye say, `Where `is' the house of the noble? And where the tent -- The tabernacles of the wicked?'"
18021029,18,21,29,Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?
18021030,18,21,30,That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought.
18021031,18,21,31,"Who doth declare to his face his way? And `for' that which he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him?"
18021032,18,21,32,And he -- to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.
18021033,18,21,33,"Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering."
18021034,18,21,34,"And how do ye comfort me `with' vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?"
18022001,18,22,1,And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
18022002,18,22,2,"To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?"
18022003,18,22,3,"Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?"
18022004,18,22,4,Because of thy reverence Doth He reason `with' thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:
18022005,18,22,5,Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities.
18022006,18,22,6,"For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the garments of the naked Thou dost strip off."
18022007,18,22,7,"Thou causest not the weary to drink water, And from the hungry thou withholdest bread."
18022008,18,22,8,"As to the man of arm -- he hath the earth, And the accepted of face -- he dwelleth in it."
18022009,18,22,9,"Widows thou hast sent away empty, And the arms of the fatherless are bruised."
18022010,18,22,10,"Therefore round about thee `are' snares, And trouble thee doth fear suddenly."
18022011,18,22,11,"Or darkness -- thou dost not see, And abundance of waters doth cover thee."
18022012,18,22,12,"Is not God high `in' heaven? And see the summit of the stars, That they are high."
18022013,18,22,13,"And thou hast said, `What -- hath God known? Through thickness doth He judge?"
18022014,18,22,14,"Thick clouds `are' a secret place to Him, And He doth not see;' And the circle of the heavens He walketh habitually,"
18022015,18,22,15,"The path of the age dost thou observe, That men of iniquity have trodden?"
18022016,18,22,16,"Who have been cut down unexpectedly, A flood is poured out on their foundation."
18022017,18,22,17,"Those saying to God, `Turn aside from us,' And what doth the Mighty One to them?"
18022018,18,22,18,And he hath filled their houses `with' good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)
18022019,18,22,19,"See do the righteous and they rejoice, And the innocent mocketh at them,"
18022020,18,22,20,"`Surely our substance hath not been cut off, And their excellency hath fire consumed.'"
18022021,18,22,21,"Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase `is' good."
18022022,18,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart."
18022023,18,22,23,"If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents."
18022024,18,22,24,"So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering."
18022025,18,22,25,"And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver `is' strength to thee."
18022026,18,22,26,"For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,"
18022027,18,22,27,"Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest."
18022028,18,22,28,"And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone."
18022029,18,22,29,"For they have made low, And thou sayest, `Lift up.' And the bowed down of eyes he saveth."
18022030,18,22,30,"He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands."
18023001,18,23,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18023002,18,23,2,"Also -- to-day `is' my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing."
18023003,18,23,3,"O that I had known -- and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,"
18023004,18,23,4,"I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill `with' arguments."
18023005,18,23,5,"I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me."
18023006,18,23,6,In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth `it' in me.
18023007,18,23,7,"There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge."
18023008,18,23,8,"Lo, forward I go -- and He is not, And backward -- and I perceive him not."
18023009,18,23,9,"`To' the left in His working -- and I see not, He is covered `on' the right, and I behold not."
18023010,18,23,10,"For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me -- as gold I go forth."
18023011,18,23,11,"On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,"
18023012,18,23,12,"The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth."
18023013,18,23,13,"And He `is' in one `mind', And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired -- and He doth `it'."
18023014,18,23,14,"For He doth complete my portion, And many such things `are' with Him."
18023015,18,23,15,"Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him."
18023016,18,23,16,"And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me."
18023017,18,23,17,"For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness."
18024001,18,24,1,"Wherefore from the Mighty One Times have not been hidden, And those knowing Him have not seen His days."
18024002,18,24,2,"The borders they reach, A drove they have taken violently away, Yea, they do evil."
18024003,18,24,3,"The ass of the fatherless they lead away, They take in pledge the ox of the widow,"
18024004,18,24,4,"They turn aside the needy from the way, Together have hid the poor of the earth."
18024005,18,24,5,"Lo, wild asses in a wilderness, They have gone out about their work, Seeking early for prey, A mixture for himself -- food for young ones."
18024006,18,24,6,"In a field his provender they reap, And the vineyard of the wicked they glean."
18024007,18,24,7,The naked they cause to lodge Without clothing. And there is no covering in the cold.
18024008,18,24,8,"From the inundation of hills they are wet, And without a refuge -- have embraced a rock."
18024009,18,24,9,"They take violently away From the breast the orphan, And on the poor they lay a pledge."
18024010,18,24,10,"Naked, they have gone without clothing, And hungry -- have taken away a sheaf."
18024011,18,24,11,"Between their walls they make oil, Wine-presses they have trodden, and thirst."
18024012,18,24,12,"Because of enmity men do groan, And the soul of pierced ones doth cry, And God doth not give praise."
18024013,18,24,13,"They have been among rebellious ones of light, They have not discerned His ways, Nor abode in His paths."
18024014,18,24,14,"At the light doth the murderer rise, He doth slay the poor and needy, And in the night he is as a thief."
18024015,18,24,15,"And the eye of an adulterer Hath observed the twilight, Saying, `No eye doth behold me.' And he putteth the face in secret."
18024016,18,24,16,"He hath dug in the darkness -- houses; By day they shut themselves up, They have not known light."
18024017,18,24,17,"When together, morning `is' to them death shade, When he discerneth the terrors of death shade."
18024018,18,24,18,"Light he `is' on the face of the waters, Vilified is their portion in the earth, He turneth not the way of vineyards."
18024019,18,24,19,"Drought -- also heat -- consume snow-waters, Sheol `those who' have sinned."
18024020,18,24,20,"Forget him doth the womb, Sweeten `on' him doth the worm, No more is he remembered, And broken as a tree is wickedness."
18024021,18,24,21,"Treating evil the barren `who' beareth not, And `to' the widow he doth no good,"
18024022,18,24,22,"And hath drawn the mighty by his power, He riseth, and none believeth in life."
18024023,18,24,23,"He giveth to him confidence, and he is supported, And his eyes `are' on their ways."
18024024,18,24,24,"High they were `for' a little, and they are not, And they have been brought low. As all `others' they are shut up, And as the head of an ear of corn cut off."
18024025,18,24,25,"And if not now, who doth prove me a liar, And doth make of nothing my word?"
18025001,18,25,1,And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
18025002,18,25,2,"The rule and fear `are' with Him, Making peace in His high places."
18025003,18,25,3,Is their `any' number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?
18025004,18,25,4,And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure -- born of a woman?
18025005,18,25,5,"Lo -- unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes."
18025006,18,25,6,"How much less man -- a grub, And the son of man -- a worm!"
18026001,18,26,1,And Job answereth and saith: --
18026002,18,26,2,"What -- thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!"
18026003,18,26,3,"What -- thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known."
18026004,18,26,4,With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?
18026005,18,26,5,"The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants."
18026006,18,26,6,"Naked `is' Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction."
18026007,18,26,7,"Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,"
18026008,18,26,8,"Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them."
18026009,18,26,9,"Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud."
18026010,18,26,10,"A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness."
18026011,18,26,11,"Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke."
18026012,18,26,12,"By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud."
18026013,18,26,13,"By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent."
18026014,18,26,14,"Lo, these `are' the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?"
18027001,18,27,1,"And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --"
18027002,18,27,2,"God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty -- He made my soul bitter."
18027003,18,27,3,"For all the while my breath `is' in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils."
18027004,18,27,4,"My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit."
18027005,18,27,5,"Pollution to me -- if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me."
18027006,18,27,6,"On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live."
18027007,18,27,7,"As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse."
18027008,18,27,8,"For what `is' the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?"
18027009,18,27,9,"His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?"
18027010,18,27,10,On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?
18027011,18,27,11,"I shew you by the hand of God, That which `is' with the Mighty I hide not."
18027012,18,27,12,"Lo, ye -- all of you -- have seen, And why `is' this -- ye are altogether vain?"
18027013,18,27,13,"This `is' the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive."
18027014,18,27,14,If his sons multiply -- for them `is' a sword. And his offspring `are' not satisfied `with' bread.
18027015,18,27,15,"His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep."
18027016,18,27,16,"If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,"
18027017,18,27,17,"He prepareth -- and the righteous putteth `it' on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion."
18027018,18,27,18,"He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made."
18027019,18,27,19,"Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not."
18027020,18,27,20,"Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind."
18027021,18,27,21,"Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,"
18027022,18,27,22,"And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth."
18027023,18,27,23,"It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place."
18028001,18,28,1,"Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;"
18028002,18,28,2,"Iron from the dust is taken, And `from' the firm stone brass."
18028003,18,28,3,"An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade."
18028004,18,28,4,"A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered."
18028005,18,28,5,"The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire."
18028006,18,28,6,"A place of the sapphire `are' its stones, And it hath dust of gold."
18028007,18,28,7,"A path -- not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,"
18028008,18,28,8,"Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion."
18028009,18,28,9,"Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains."
18028010,18,28,10,"Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen."
18028011,18,28,11,"From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out `to' light."
18028012,18,28,12,"And the wisdom -- whence is it found? And where `is' this, the place of understanding?"
18028013,18,28,13,"Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living."
18028014,18,28,14,"The deep hath said, `It `is' not in me,' And the sea hath said, `It is not with me.'"
18028015,18,28,15,"Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed -- its price."
18028016,18,28,16,"It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,"
18028017,18,28,17,"Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor `is' its exchange a vessel of fine gold."
18028018,18,28,18,"Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom `is' above rubies."
18028019,18,28,19,"Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued."
18028020,18,28,20,"And the wisdom -- whence doth it come? And where `is' this, the place of understanding?"
18028021,18,28,21,It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.
18028022,18,28,22,Destruction and death have said: `With our ears we have heard its fame.'
18028023,18,28,23,"God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place."
18028024,18,28,24,"For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,"
18028025,18,28,25,"To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure."
18028026,18,28,26,"In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,"
18028027,18,28,27,"Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,"
18028028,18,28,28,"And He saith to man: -- `Lo, fear of the Lord, that `is' wisdom, And to turn from evil `is' understanding.'"
18029001,18,29,1,"And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --"
18029002,18,29,2,"Who doth make me as `in' months past, As `in' the days of God's preserving me?"
18029003,18,29,3,"In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk `through' darkness."
18029004,18,29,4,"As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent."
18029005,18,29,5,"When yet the Mighty One `is' with me. Round about me -- my young ones,"
18029006,18,29,6,"When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock `is' with me rivulets of oil."
18029007,18,29,7,"When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat."
18029008,18,29,8,"Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen -- they stood up."
18029009,18,29,9,"Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth."
18029010,18,29,10,"The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved."
18029011,18,29,11,"For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth `to' me."
18029012,18,29,12,"For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper."
18029013,18,29,13,"The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing."
18029014,18,29,14,"Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice."
18029015,18,29,15,"Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame `am' I."
18029016,18,29,16,"A father I `am' to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out."
18029017,18,29,17,"And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey."
18029018,18,29,18,"And I say, `With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.'"
18029019,18,29,19,"My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch."
18029020,18,29,20,"My honour `is' fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed."
18029021,18,29,21,"To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel."
18029022,18,29,22,"After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,"
18029023,18,29,23,"And they wait as `for' rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide `As' for the latter rain."
18029024,18,29,24,"I laugh unto them -- they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall."
18029025,18,29,25,"I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort."
18030001,18,30,1,"And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock."
18030002,18,30,2,"Also -- the power of their hands, why `is it' to me? On them hath old age perished."
18030003,18,30,3,"With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,"
18030004,18,30,4,"Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots `is' their food."
18030005,18,30,5,"From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),"
18030006,18,30,6,"In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts."
18030007,18,30,7,"Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together."
18030008,18,30,8,"Sons of folly -- even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land."
18030009,18,30,9,"And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword."
18030010,18,30,10,"They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit."
18030011,18,30,11,"Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away."
18030012,18,30,12,"On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity."
18030013,18,30,13,"They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, `He hath no helper.'"
18030014,18,30,14,"As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves."
18030015,18,30,15,"He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away."
18030016,18,30,16,"And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction."
18030017,18,30,17,"At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down."
18030018,18,30,18,"By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me."
18030019,18,30,19,"Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes."
18030020,18,30,20,"I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me."
18030021,18,30,21,"Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppresest me."
18030022,18,30,22,"Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest -- Thou levellest me."
18030023,18,30,23,"For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And `to' the house appointed for all living."
18030024,18,30,24,"Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety."
18030025,18,30,25,Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.
18030026,18,30,26,"When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for light, and darkness cometh."
18030027,18,30,27,"My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction."
18030028,18,30,28,"Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry."
18030029,18,30,29,"A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich."
18030030,18,30,30,"My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,"
18030031,18,30,31,"And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping."
18031001,18,31,1,"A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what -- do I attend to a virgin?"
18031002,18,31,2,And what `is' the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?
18031003,18,31,3,Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?
18031004,18,31,4,"Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?"
18031005,18,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,"
18031006,18,31,6,"He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity."
18031007,18,31,7,"If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,"
18031008,18,31,8,"Let me sow -- and another eat, And my products let be rooted out."
18031009,18,31,9,"If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,"
18031010,18,31,10,"Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend."
18031011,18,31,11,"For it `is' a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;"
18031012,18,31,12,"For a fire it `is', to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root,"
18031013,18,31,13,"If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,"
18031014,18,31,14,"Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?"
18031015,18,31,15,"Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One."
18031016,18,31,16,"If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,"
18031017,18,31,17,"And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it,"
18031018,18,31,18,"(But from my youth He grew up with me as `with' a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.)"
18031019,18,31,19,"If I see `any' perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy,"
18031020,18,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,"
18031021,18,31,21,"If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in `him' the gate of my court,"
18031022,18,31,22,"My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken."
18031023,18,31,23,"For a dread unto me `is' calamity `from' God, And because of His excellency I am not able."
18031024,18,31,24,"If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, `My trust,'"
18031025,18,31,25,"If I rejoice because great `is' my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found,"
18031026,18,31,26,"If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,"
18031027,18,31,27,"And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,"
18031028,18,31,28,"It also `is' a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above."
18031029,18,31,29,"If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,"
18031030,18,31,30,"Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life."
18031031,18,31,31,"If not -- say ye, O men of my tent, `O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.'"
18031032,18,31,32,"In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open."
18031033,18,31,33,"If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,"
18031034,18,31,34,"Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening."
18031035,18,31,35,"Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written."
18031036,18,31,36,"If not -- on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself."
18031037,18,31,37,"The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him."
18031038,18,31,38,"If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,"
18031039,18,31,39,"If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,"
18031040,18,31,40,"Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished."
18032001,18,32,1,"And these three men cease from answering Job, for he `is' righteous in his own eyes,"
18032002,18,32,2,"and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;"
18032003,18,32,3,"and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job."
18032004,18,32,4,"And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days."
18032005,18,32,5,"And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth."
18032006,18,32,6,"And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith: -- Young I `am' in days, and ye `are' age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion."
18032007,18,32,7,"I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom."
18032008,18,32,8,"Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand."
18032009,18,32,9,"The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment."
18032010,18,32,10,"Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion -- even I."
18032011,18,32,11,"Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings."
18032012,18,32,12,"And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, `Or' answerer of his sayings among you."
18032013,18,32,13,"Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man."
18032014,18,32,14,"And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him."
18032015,18,32,15,"(They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words."
18032016,18,32,16,"And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)"
18032017,18,32,17,"I answer, even I -- my share, I shew my opinion -- even I."
18032018,18,32,18,"For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,"
18032019,18,32,19,"Lo, my breast `is' as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up."
18032020,18,32,20,"I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer."
18032021,18,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,"
18032022,18,32,22,"For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away."
18033001,18,33,1,"And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and `to' all my words give ear."
18033002,18,33,2,"Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate."
18033003,18,33,3,"Of the uprightness of my heart `are' my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken."
18033004,18,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me."
18033005,18,33,5,"If thou art able -- answer me, Set in array before me -- station thyself."
18033006,18,33,6,"Lo, I `am', according to thy word, for God, From the clay I -- I also, have been formed."
18033007,18,33,7,"Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy."
18033008,18,33,8,"Surely -- thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:"
18033009,18,33,9,"`Pure `am' I, without transgression, Innocent `am' I, and I have no iniquity."
18033010,18,33,10,"Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,"
18033011,18,33,11,"He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.'"
18033012,18,33,12,"Lo, `in' this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man."
18033013,18,33,13,"Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When `for' all His matters He answereth not?"
18033014,18,33,14,"For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)"
18033015,18,33,15,"In a dream -- a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed."
18033016,18,33,16,"Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:"
18033017,18,33,17,"To turn aside man `from' doing, And pride from man He concealeth."
18033018,18,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart."
18033019,18,33,19,"And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones `is' enduring."
18033020,18,33,20,"And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food."
18033021,18,33,21,"His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!"
18033022,18,33,22,"And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death."
18033023,18,33,23,"If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter -- one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:"
18033024,18,33,24,"Then He doth favour him and saith, `Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.'"
18033025,18,33,25,"Fresher `is' his flesh than a child's, He returneth to the days of his youth."
18033026,18,33,26,"He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness."
18033027,18,33,27,"He looketh on men, and saith, `I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me."
18033028,18,33,28,"He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.'"
18033029,18,33,29,"Lo, all these doth God work, Twice -- thrice with man,"
18033030,18,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living."
18033031,18,33,31,"Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I -- I do speak."
18033032,18,33,32,"If there are words -- answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee."
18033033,18,33,33,"If there are not -- hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom."
18034001,18,34,1,And Elihu answereth and saith:
18034002,18,34,2,"Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me."
18034003,18,34,3,"For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat."
18034004,18,34,4,"Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what `is' good."
18034005,18,34,5,"For Job hath said, `I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,"
18034006,18,34,6,Against my right do I lie? Mortal `is' mine arrow -- without transgression.'
18034007,18,34,7,"Who `is' a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,"
18034008,18,34,8,"And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness."
18034009,18,34,9,"For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.'"
18034010,18,34,10,"Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And `from' the Mighty to do perverseness:"
18034011,18,34,11,"For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find."
18034012,18,34,12,"Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment."
18034013,18,34,13,Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?
18034014,18,34,14,"If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth."
18034015,18,34,15,"Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth."
18034016,18,34,16,"And if `there is' understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words."
18034017,18,34,17,"Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?"
18034018,18,34,18,"Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless,' Unto princes -- `Wicked?'"
18034019,18,34,19,"That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands `are' all of them."
18034020,18,34,20,"`In' a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand."
18034021,18,34,21,"For His eyes `are' on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see."
18034022,18,34,22,"There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;"
18034023,18,34,23,"For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,"
18034024,18,34,24,He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.
18034025,18,34,25,"Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised."
18034026,18,34,26,"As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders."
18034027,18,34,27,"Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,"
18034028,18,34,28,"To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth."
18034029,18,34,29,"And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, `It is' the same."
18034030,18,34,30,"From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;"
18034031,18,34,31,"For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away, I do not corruptly,"
18034032,18,34,32,"Besides `that which' I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done -- I do not add?'"
18034033,18,34,33,"By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused -- That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak."
18034034,18,34,34,"Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me."
18034035,18,34,35,"Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words `are' not with wisdom."
18034036,18,34,36,"My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,"
18034037,18,34,37,"For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God."
18035001,18,35,1,And Elihu answereth and saith: --
18035002,18,35,2,This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said -- `My righteousness `is' more than God's?'
18035003,18,35,3,"For thou sayest, `What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?'"
18035004,18,35,4,"I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,"
18035005,18,35,5,"Behold attentively the heavens -- and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou."
18035006,18,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?"
18035007,18,35,7,"If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?"
18035008,18,35,8,"For a man like thyself `is' thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness."
18035009,18,35,9,"Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty."
18035010,18,35,10,"And none said, `Where `is' God my maker? Giving songs in the night,"
18035011,18,35,11,"Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.'"
18035012,18,35,12,"There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers."
18035013,18,35,13,"Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it."
18035014,18,35,14,"Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment `is' before Him, and stay for Him."
18035015,18,35,15,"And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity."
18035016,18,35,16,"And Job `with' vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth."
18036001,18,36,1,And Elihu addeth and saith: --
18036002,18,36,2,"Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God `are' words."
18036003,18,36,3,"I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness."
18036004,18,36,4,"For, truly, my words `are' not false, The perfect in knowledge `is' with thee."
18036005,18,36,5,"Lo, God `is' mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty `in' power `and' heart."
18036006,18,36,6,"He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;"
18036007,18,36,7,"He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And `from' kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,"
18036008,18,36,8,"And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,"
18036009,18,36,9,"Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,"
18036010,18,36,10,"And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity."
18036011,18,36,11,"If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness."
18036012,18,36,12,"And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge."
18036013,18,36,13,"And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them."
18036014,18,36,14,"Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled."
18036015,18,36,15,"He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear."
18036016,18,36,16,"And also He moved thee from a strait place, `To' a broad place -- no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness."
18036017,18,36,17,"And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld -- because of fury,"
18036018,18,36,18,"Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside."
18036019,18,36,19,"Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power."
18036020,18,36,20,"Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead."
18036021,18,36,21,"Take heed -- do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than `on' affliction."
18036022,18,36,22,"Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who `is' like Him -- a teacher?"
18036023,18,36,23,"Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, `Thou hast done iniquity?'"
18036024,18,36,24,Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.
18036025,18,36,25,"All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar."
18036026,18,36,26,"Lo, God `is' high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there `is' no searching."
18036027,18,36,27,"When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,"
18036028,18,36,28,"Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly."
18036029,18,36,29,"Yea, doth `any' understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?"
18036030,18,36,30,"Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,"
18036031,18,36,31,"For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance."
18036032,18,36,32,"By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,"
18036033,18,36,33,"He sheweth by it `to' his friend substance, Anger against perversity."
18037001,18,37,1,"Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place."
18037002,18,37,2,"Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth."
18037003,18,37,3,"Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light `is' over the skirts of the earth."
18037004,18,37,4,"After it roar doth a voice -- He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard."
18037005,18,37,5,"God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not."
18037006,18,37,6,"For to snow He saith, `Be `on' the earth.' And the small rain and great rain of His power."
18037007,18,37,7,"Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work."
18037008,18,37,8,"And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue."
18037009,18,37,9,"From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds -- cold,"
18037010,18,37,10,"From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,"
18037011,18,37,11,"Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light."
18037012,18,37,12,"And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth."
18037013,18,37,13,"Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness -- He doth cause it to come."
18037014,18,37,14,"Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God."
18037015,18,37,15,"Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?"
18037016,18,37,16,Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?
18037017,18,37,17,"How thy garments `are' warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south?"
18037018,18,37,18,Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds -- strong as a hard mirror!
18037019,18,37,19,"Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness."
18037020,18,37,20,"Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up."
18037021,18,37,21,"And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it `is' in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them."
18037022,18,37,22,"From the golden north it cometh, Beside God `is' fearful honour."
18037023,18,37,23,"The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,"
18037024,18,37,24,"Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart."
18038001,18,38,1,"And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: --"
18038002,18,38,2,"Who `is' this -- darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?"
18038003,18,38,3,"Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know."
18038004,18,38,4,"Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding."
18038005,18,38,5,Who placed its measures -- if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?
18038006,18,38,6,On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?
18038007,18,38,7,"In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,"
18038008,18,38,8,"And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out."
18038009,18,38,9,"In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,"
18038010,18,38,10,"And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,"
18038011,18,38,11,"And say, `Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.'"
18038012,18,38,12,Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?
18038013,18,38,13,"To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,"
18038014,18,38,14,It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.
18038015,18,38,15,"And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken."
18038016,18,38,16,Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?
18038017,18,38,17,Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?
18038018,18,38,18,"Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare -- if thou hast known it all."
18038019,18,38,19,"Where `is' this -- the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where `is' this -- its place?"
18038020,18,38,20,"That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house."
18038021,18,38,21,Thou hast known -- for then thou art born And the number of thy days `are' many!
18038022,18,38,22,"Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?"
18038023,18,38,23,"That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle."
18038024,18,38,24,"Where `is' this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth."
18038025,18,38,25,Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?
18038026,18,38,26,"To cause `it' to rain on a land -- no man, A wilderness -- no man in it."
18038027,18,38,27,"To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?"
18038028,18,38,28,Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
18038029,18,38,29,"From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?"
18038030,18,38,30,"As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured."
18038031,18,38,31,Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?
18038032,18,38,32,Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?
18038033,18,38,33,Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?
18038034,18,38,34,"Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?"
18038035,18,38,35,"Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, `Behold us?'"
18038036,18,38,36,Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?
18038037,18,38,37,"Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,"
18038038,18,38,38,"In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?"
18038039,18,38,39,Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?
18038040,18,38,40,When they bow down in dens -- Abide in a thicket for a covert?
18038041,18,38,41,"Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food."
18039001,18,39,1,Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!
18039002,18,39,2,Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!
18039003,18,39,3,"They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely, Their pangs they cast forth."
18039004,18,39,4,"Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they have gone out, And have not returned to them."
18039005,18,39,5,"Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of the wild ass who opened?"
18039006,18,39,6,"Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings the barren land,"
18039007,18,39,7,"He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an exactor he heareth not."
18039008,18,39,8,"The range of mountains `is' his pasture, And after every green thing he seeketh."
18039009,18,39,9,Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?
18039010,18,39,10,Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow `with' his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?
18039011,18,39,11,Dost thou trust in him because great `is' his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?
18039012,18,39,12,Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And `to' thy threshing-floor doth gather `it'?
18039013,18,39,13,"The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion of the ostrich or hawk."
18039014,18,39,14,"For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she doth warm them,"
18039015,18,39,15,"And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast of the field tread it down."
18039016,18,39,16,"Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain `is' her labour without fear."
18039017,18,39,17,"For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not given a portion To her in understanding:"
18039018,18,39,18,"At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth at the horse and at his rider."
18039019,18,39,19,Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck `with' a mane?
18039020,18,39,20,Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting `is' terrible.
18039021,18,39,21,"They dig in a valley, and he rejoiceth in power, He goeth forth to meet the armour."
18039022,18,39,22,"He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted, And he turneth not back from the face of the sword."
18039023,18,39,23,"Against him rattle doth quiver, The flame of a spear, and a halbert."
18039024,18,39,24,"With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground, And remaineth not stedfast Because of the sound of a trumpet."
18039025,18,39,25,"Among the trumpets he saith, Aha, And from afar he doth smell battle, Roaring of princes and shouting."
18039026,18,39,26,By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?
18039027,18,39,27,At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?
18039028,18,39,28,"A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a rock, and fortress."
18039029,18,39,29,"From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his eyes look attentively,"
18039030,18,39,30,"And his brood gulph up blood, And where the pierced `are' -- there `is' he!"
18040001,18,40,1,"And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith: --"
18040002,18,40,2,"Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it."
18040003,18,40,3,"And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith: --"
18040004,18,40,4,"Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I have placed on my mouth."
18040005,18,40,5,"Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add not."
18040006,18,40,6,"And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: --"
18040007,18,40,7,"Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know."

18040009,18,40,9,And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?
18040010,18,40,10,"Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour and beauty put on."
18040011,18,40,11,"Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every proud one, and make him low."

18040016,18,40,16,"Lo, I pray thee, his power `is' in his loins, And his strength in the muscles of his belly."
18040017,18,40,17,"He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together,"

18040023,18,40,23,"Lo, a flood oppresseth -- he doth not haste, He is confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth."

18042006,18,42,6,"Therefore do I loathe `it', And I have repented on dust and ashes."
18042007,18,42,7,"And it cometh to pass after Jehovah's speaking these words unto Job, that Jehovah saith unto Eliphaz the Temanite, `Burned hath Mine anger against thee, and against thy two friends, because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My servant Job."
18042008,18,42,8,"And now, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go ye unto My servant Job, and ye have caused a burnt-offering to ascend for you; and Job My servant doth pray for you, for surely his face I accept, so as not to do with you folly, because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My servant Job."
18042009,18,42,9,"And they go -- Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite -- and do as Jehovah hath spoken unto them; and Jehovah doth accept the face of Job."
18042010,18,42,10,"And Jehovah hath turned `to' the captivity of Job in his praying for his friends, and Jehovah doth add `to' all that Job hath -- to double."
18042011,18,42,11,"And come unto him do all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all his former acquaintances, and they eat bread with him in his house, and bemoan him, and comfort him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him, and they gave to him each one kesitah, and each one ring of gold."
18042012,18,42,12,"And Jehovah hath blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning, and he hath fourteen thousand of a flock, and six thousand camels, and a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand she-asses."
18042013,18,42,13,And he hath seven sons and three daughters;
18042014,18,42,14,"and he calleth the name of the one Jemima, and the name of the second Kezia, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch."
18042015,18,42,15,"And there have not been found women fair as the daughters of Job in all the land, and their father doth give to them an inheritance in the midst of their brethren."

18042017,18,42,17,"and Job dieth, aged and satisfied `with' days."
19001001,19,1,1,"O the happiness of that one, who Hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked. And in the way of sinners hath not stood, And in the seat of scorners hath not sat;"
19001002,19,1,2,"But -- in the law of Jehovah `is' his delight, And in His law he doth meditate by day and by night:"
19001003,19,1,3,"And he hath been as a tree, Planted by rivulets of water, That giveth its fruit in its season, And its leaf doth not wither, And all that he doth he causeth to prosper."
19001004,19,1,4,Not so the wicked: But -- as chaff that wind driveth away!
19001005,19,1,5,"Therefore the wicked rise not in judgment, Nor sinners in the company of the righteous,"

19035022,19,35,22,"Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord -- be not far from me,"
19035023,19,35,23,"Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea."
19035024,19,35,24,"Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me."
19035025,19,35,25,"They do not say in their heart, `Aha, our desire.' They do not say, `We swallowed him up.'"
19035026,19,35,26,"They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me."
19035027,19,35,27,"They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, `Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.'"
19035028,19,35,28,"And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!"
19036001,19,36,1,"To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, `Fear of God is not before his eyes,"
19036002,19,36,2,"For he made `it' smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated."
19036003,19,36,3,"The words of his mouth `are' iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently -- to do good."
19036004,19,36,4,"Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'"
19036005,19,36,5,"O Jehovah, in the heavens `is' Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness `is' unto the clouds."
19036006,19,36,6,"Thy righteousness `is' as mountains of God, Thy judgments `are' a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah."
19036007,19,36,7,"How precious `is' Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust."
19036008,19,36,8,"They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink."
19036009,19,36,9,"For with Thee `is' a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light."
19036010,19,36,10,"Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart."
19036011,19,36,11,"Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me."
19036012,19,36,12,"There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!"
19037001,19,37,1,"By David. Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,"
19037002,19,37,2,"For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade."
19037003,19,37,3,"Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell `in' the land, and enjoy faithfulness,"
19037004,19,37,4,"And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He giveth to thee the petitions of thy heart."
19037005,19,37,5,"Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon Him, and He worketh,"
19037006,19,37,6,"And hath brought out as light thy righteousness, And thy judgment as noon-day."
19037007,19,37,7,"Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because of a man doing wicked devices."
19037008,19,37,8,"Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only to do evil."
19037009,19,37,9,"For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Jehovah, they possess the land."
19037010,19,37,10,"And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And thou hast considered his place, and it is not."
19037011,19,37,11,"And the humble do possess the land, And they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace."
19037012,19,37,12,"The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth."
19037013,19,37,13,"The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath seen that his day cometh."
19037014,19,37,14,"A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter the upright of the way."
19037015,19,37,15,"Their sword doth enter into their own heart, And their bows are shivered."
19037016,19,37,16,"Better `is' the little of the righteous, Than the store of many wicked."
19037017,19,37,17,"For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Jehovah is sustaining the righteous."
19037018,19,37,18,"Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is -- to the age."
19037019,19,37,19,"They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of famine they are satisfied."
19037020,19,37,20,"But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Jehovah, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have been consumed."
19037021,19,37,21,"The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the righteous is gracious and giving."
19037022,19,37,22,"For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled ones are cut off."
19037023,19,37,23,"From Jehovah `are' the steps of a man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth."
19037024,19,37,24,"When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Jehovah is sustaining his hand."
19037025,19,37,25,"Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread."
19037026,19,37,26,"All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed `is' for a blessing."
19037027,19,37,27,"Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age."
19037028,19,37,28,"For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He doth not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed of the wicked is cut off."
19037029,19,37,29,"The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on it."
19037030,19,37,30,"The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh judgment."
19037031,19,37,31,"The law of his God `is' his heart, His steps do not slide."
19037032,19,37,32,"The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to put him to death."
19037033,19,37,33,"Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in his being judged."
19037034,19,37,34,"Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way, And He doth exalt thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off -- thou seest!"
19037035,19,37,35,"I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green native plant,"
19037036,19,37,36,"And he passeth away, and lo, he is not, And I seek him, and he is not found!"
19037037,19,37,37,"Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter end of each `is' peace."
19037038,19,37,38,"And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off."
19037039,19,37,39,"And the salvation of the righteous `is' from Jehovah, Their strong place in a time of adversity."
19037040,19,37,40,"And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in Him!"
19038001,19,38,1,"A Psalm of David, `To cause to remember.' Jehovah, in Thy wrath reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me."
19038002,19,38,2,"For Thine arrows have come down on me, And Thou lettest down upon me Thy hand."
19038003,19,38,3,"Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin."
19038004,19,38,4,"For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy burden -- too heavy for me."
19038005,19,38,5,"Stunk -- become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my folly."
19038006,19,38,6,"I have been bent down, I have been bowed down -- unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning."
19038007,19,38,7,"For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is not in my flesh."
19038008,19,38,8,"I have been feeble and smitten -- unto excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart."
19038009,19,38,9,"Lord, before Thee `is' all my desire, And my sighing from Thee hath not been hid."
19038010,19,38,10,"My heart `is' panting, my power hath forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me."
19038011,19,38,11,My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.
19038012,19,38,12,"And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits meditate all the day."
19038013,19,38,13,"And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who openeth not his mouth."
19038014,19,38,14,"Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are no reproofs."
19038015,19,38,15,"Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have waited, Thou dost answer, O Lord my God."
19038016,19,38,16,"When I said, `Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves."
19038017,19,38,17,"For I am ready to halt, And my pain `is' before me continually."
19038018,19,38,18,"For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin."
19038019,19,38,19,"And mine enemies `are' lively, They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied."
19038020,19,38,20,"And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my pursuing good."
19038021,19,38,21,"Do not forsake me, O Jehovah, My God, be not far from me,"
19038022,19,38,22,"Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!"
19039001,19,39,1,"To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of David. I have said, `I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked `is' before me.'"
19039002,19,39,2,"I was dumb `with' silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited."
19039003,19,39,3,"Hot `is' my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue."
19039004,19,39,4,"`Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of my days -- what it `is',' I know how frail I `am'."
19039005,19,39,5,"Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age `is' as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity `is' every man set up. Selah."
19039006,19,39,6,"Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, `in' vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them."
19039007,19,39,7,"And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope -- it `is' of Thee."
19039008,19,39,8,"From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not."
19039009,19,39,9,"I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou -- Thou hast done `it'."
19039010,19,39,10,"Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed."
19039011,19,39,11,"With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity `is' every man. Selah."
19039012,19,39,12,"Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And `to' my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I `am' with Thee, A settler like all my fathers."
19039013,19,39,13,"Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!"
19040001,19,40,1,"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. I have diligently expected Jehovah, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my cry,"
19040002,19,40,2,"And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation -- from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is establishing my steps."
19040003,19,40,3,"And He putteth in my mouth a new song, `Praise to our God.' Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah."
19040004,19,40,4,"O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust, And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to lies."
19040005,19,40,5,"Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy wonders and Thy thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered."
19040006,19,40,6,"Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired, Ears Thou hast prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou hast not asked."
19040007,19,40,7,"Then said I, `Lo, I have come,' In the roll of the book it is written of me,"
19040008,19,40,8,"To do Thy pleasure, my God, I have delighted, And Thy law `is' within my heart."
19040009,19,40,9,"I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great assembly, lo, my lips I restrain not, O Jehovah, Thou hast known."
19040010,19,40,10,"Thy righteousness I have not concealed In the midst of my heart, Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation I have told, I have not hidden Thy kindness and Thy truth, To the great assembly."
19040011,19,40,11,"Thou, O Jehovah, restrainest not Thy mercies from me, Thy kindness and Thy truth do continually keep me."
19040012,19,40,12,"For compassed me have evils innumerable, Overtaken me have mine iniquities, And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart hath forsaken me."
19040013,19,40,13,"Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help make haste."
19040014,19,40,14,"They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, They are turned backward, And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil."
19040015,19,40,15,"They are desolate because of their shame, Who are saying to me, `Aha, aha.'"
19040016,19,40,16,"All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee, Those loving Thy salvation say continually, `Jehovah is magnified.'"
19040017,19,40,17,"And I `am' poor and needy, The Lord doth devise for me. My help and my deliverer `art' Thou, O my God, tarry Thou not."
19041001,19,41,1,"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil doth Jehovah deliver him."
19041002,19,41,2,"Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his enemies."
19041003,19,41,3,"Jehovah supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness."
19041004,19,41,4,"I -- I said, `O Jehovah, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'"
19041005,19,41,5,Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth -- his name hath perished!
19041006,19,41,6,"And if he came to see -- vanity he speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out -- at the street he speaketh."
19041007,19,41,7,"All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:"
19041008,19,41,8,"A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again."
19041009,19,41,9,"Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,"
19041010,19,41,10,"And Thou, Jehovah, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them."
19041011,19,41,11,"By this I have known, That Thou hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me."
19041012,19,41,12,"As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age."
19041013,19,41,13,"Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age -- and unto the age. Amen and Amen."
19042001,19,42,1,"To the Overseer. -- An Instruction. By sons of Korah. As a hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward Thee, O God."
19042002,19,42,2,"My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I enter and see the face of God?"
19042003,19,42,3,"My tear hath been to me bread day and night, In their saying unto me all the day, `Where `is' thy God?'"
19042004,19,42,4,"These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping feast!"
19042005,19,42,5,"What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? Yea, art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The salvation of my countenance -- My God!"
19042006,19,42,6,"In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar."
19042007,19,42,7,"Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me."
19042008,19,42,8,"By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness, And by night a song `is' with me, A prayer to the God of my life."
19042009,19,42,9,"I say to God my rock, `Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?"
19042010,19,42,10,"With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, `Where `is' thy God?'"
19042011,19,42,11,"What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!"
19043001,19,43,1,"Judge me, O God, And plead my cause against a nation not pious, From a man of deceit and perverseness Thou dost deliver me,"
19043002,19,43,2,"For thou `art' the God of my strength. Why hast Thou cast me off? Why mourning do I go up and down, In the oppression of an enemy?"
19043003,19,43,3,"Send forth Thy light and Thy truth, They -- they lead me, they bring me in, Unto Thy holy hill, and unto Thy tabernacles."
19043004,19,43,4,"And I go in unto the altar of God, Unto God, the joy of my rejoicing. And I thank Thee with a harp, O God, my God."
19043005,19,43,5,"What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!"
19044001,19,44,1,"To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. An Instruction. O God, with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have recounted to us, The work Thou didst work in their days, In the days of old."
19044002,19,44,2,"Thou, `with' Thy hand, nations hast dispossessed. And Thou dost plant them. Thou afflictest peoples, and sendest them away."
19044003,19,44,3,"For, not by their sword Possessed they the land, And their arm gave not salvation to them, But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, And the light of Thy countenance, Because Thou hadst accepted them."
19044004,19,44,4,"Thou `art' He, my king, O God, Command the deliverances of Jacob."
19044005,19,44,5,"By Thee our adversaries we do push, By Thy name tread down our withstanders,"
19044006,19,44,6,"For, not in my bow do I trust, And my sword doth not save me."
19044007,19,44,7,"For Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And those hating us Thou hast put to shame."
19044008,19,44,8,"In God we have boasted all the day, And Thy name to the age we thank. Selah."
19044009,19,44,9,"In anger Thou hast cast off and causest us to blush, And goest not forth with our hosts."
19044010,19,44,10,"Thou causest us to turn backward from an adversary, And those hating us, Have spoiled for themselves."
19044011,19,44,11,"Thou makest us food like sheep, And among nations Thou hast scattered us."
19044012,19,44,12,"Thou sellest Thy people -- without wealth, And hast not become great by their price."
19044013,19,44,13,"Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders."
19044014,19,44,14,"Thou makest us a simile among nations, A shaking of the head among peoples."
19044015,19,44,15,"All the day my confusion `is' before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me."
19044016,19,44,16,"Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, Because of an enemy and a self-avenger."
19044017,19,44,17,"All this met us, and we did not forget Thee, Nor have we dealt falsely in Thy covenant."
19044018,19,44,18,"We turn not backward our heart, Nor turn aside doth our step from Thy path."
19044019,19,44,19,"But Thou hast smitten us in a place of dragons, And dost cover us over with death-shade."
19044020,19,44,20,"If we have forgotten the name of our God, And spread our hands to a strange God,"
19044021,19,44,21,Doth not God search out this? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.
19044022,19,44,22,"Surely, for Thy sake we have been slain all the day, Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter."
19044023,19,44,23,"Stir up -- why dost Thou sleep, O Lord? Awake, cast us not off for ever."
19044024,19,44,24,"Why Thy face hidest Thou? Thou forgettest our afflictions and our oppression,"
19044025,19,44,25,"For bowed to the dust hath our soul, Cleaved to the earth hath our belly."
19044026,19,44,26,"Arise, a help to us, And ransom us for thy kindness' sake."
19045001,19,45,1,"To the Overseer. -- `On the Lilies.' -- By sons of Korah. -- An Instruction. -- A song of loves. My heart hath indited a good thing, I am telling my works to a king, My tongue `is' the pen of a speedy writer."
19045002,19,45,2,"Thou hast been beautified above the sons of men, Grace hath been poured into thy lips, Therefore hath God blessed thee to the age."
19045003,19,45,3,"Gird Thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty, Thy glory and Thy majesty!"
19045004,19,45,4,"As to Thy majesty -- prosper! -- ride! Because of truth, and meekness -- righteousness, And Thy right hand showeth Thee fearful things."
19045005,19,45,5,"Thine arrows `are' sharp, -- Peoples fall under Thee -- In the heart of the enemies of the king."
19045006,19,45,6,"Thy throne, O God, `is' age-during, and for ever, A sceptre of uprightness `Is' the sceptre of Thy kingdom."
19045007,19,45,7,"Thou hast loved righteousness and hatest wickedness, Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, Oil of joy above thy companions."
19045008,19,45,8,"Myrrh and aloes, cassia! all thy garments, Out of palaces of ivory Stringed instruments have made thee glad."
19045009,19,45,9,"Daughters of kings `are' among thy precious ones, A queen hath stood at thy right hand, In pure gold of Ophir."
19045010,19,45,10,"Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline thine ear, And forget thy people, and thy father's house,"
19045011,19,45,11,"And the king doth desire thy beauty, Because he `is' thy lord -- bow thyself to him,"
19045012,19,45,12,"And the daughter of Tyre with a present, The rich of the people do appease thy face."
19045013,19,45,13,"All glory `is' the daughter of the king within, Of gold-embroidered work `is' her clothing."
19045014,19,45,14,"In divers colours she is brought to the king, Virgins -- after her -- her companions, Are brought to thee."

19055011,19,55,11,Mischiefs `are' in its midst. Fraud and deceit depart not from its street.
19055012,19,55,12,"For an enemy reproacheth me not, or I bear `it', He who is hating me Hath not magnified himself against me, Or I hide from him."

19055018,19,55,18,"He hath ransomed in peace my soul From him who is near to me, For with the multitude they were with me."
19055019,19,55,19,"God doth hear and afflict them, And He sitteth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God,"
19055020,19,55,20,"He hath sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, He hath polluted his covenant."
19055021,19,55,21,"Sweeter than honey hath been his mouth, And his heart `is' war! Softer have been his words than oil, And they `are' drawn `swords'."
19055022,19,55,22,"Cast on Jehovah that which He hath given thee, And He doth sustain thee, He doth not suffer for ever the moving of the righteous."
19055023,19,55,23,"And Thou, O God, dost bring them down To a pit of destruction, Men of blood and deceit reach not to half their days, And I -- I do trust in Thee!"
19056001,19,56,1,"To the Overseer. -- `On the Dumb Dove far off.' -- A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,"

19056005,19,56,5,"All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts `are' for evil,"
19056006,19,56,6,"They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul."
19056007,19,56,7,"By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God."
19056008,19,56,8,"My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou -- place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?"
19056009,19,56,9,"Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God `is' for me."
19056010,19,56,10,"In God I praise the word, In Jehovah I praise the word."
19056011,19,56,11,"In God I trusted, I fear not what man doth to me,"
19056012,19,56,12,"On me, O God, `are' Thy vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee."
19056013,19,56,13,"For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!"
19057001,19,57,1,"To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over."
19057002,19,57,2,"I call to God Most High, To God `who' is perfecting for me."
19057003,19,57,3,"He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached -- who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth."
19057004,19,57,4,"My soul `is' in the midst of lions, I lie down `among' flames -- sons of men, Their teeth `are' a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword."
19057005,19,57,5,"Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour."
19057006,19,57,6,"A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah."
19057007,19,57,7,"Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise."
19057008,19,57,8,"Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn."
19057009,19,57,9,"I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations."
19057010,19,57,10,"For great unto the heavens `is' Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth."
19057011,19,57,11,"Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!"
19058001,19,58,1,"To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure, by David. Is it true, O dumb one, righteously ye speak? Uprightly ye judge, O sons of men?"
19058002,19,58,2,"Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the land the violence of your hands ye ponder."
19058003,19,58,3,"The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies."
19058004,19,58,4,"Their poison `is' as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear,"
19058005,19,58,5,"Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful."
19058006,19,58,6,"O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Jehovah."
19058007,19,58,7,"They are melted as waters, They go up and down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off."
19058008,19,58,8,"As a snail that melteth he goeth on, `As' an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun."
19058009,19,58,9,"Before your pots discern the bramble, As well the raw as the heated He whirleth away."
19058010,19,58,10,"The righteous rejoiceth that he hath seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked."
19058011,19,58,11,And man saith: `Surely fruit `is' for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'
19059001,19,59,1,"To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not,' by David. -- A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house to put him to death. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high."
19059002,19,59,2,"Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me."
19059003,19,59,3,"For, lo, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Jehovah."
19059004,19,59,4,"Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see."
19059005,19,59,5,"And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah."

19077007,19,77,7,To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?
19077008,19,77,8,Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?
19077009,19,77,9,Hath God forgotten `His' favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.

19078017,19,78,17,"And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most High in the dry place."
19078018,19,78,18,"And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their lust."
19078019,19,78,19,And they speak against God -- they said: `Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'
19078020,19,78,20,"Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams overflow. `Also -- bread `is' He able to give? Doth He prepare flesh for His people?'"
19078021,19,78,21,"Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also hath gone up against Israel,"
19078022,19,78,22,"For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted in His salvation."
19078023,19,78,23,"And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the heavens He hath opened."
19078024,19,78,24,"And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven He hath given to them."
19078025,19,78,25,"Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to them to satiety."
19078026,19,78,26,"He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,"
19078027,19,78,27,"And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the seas -- winged fowl,"
19078028,19,78,28,"And causeth `it' to fall in the midst of His camp, Round about His tabernacles."
19078029,19,78,29,"And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire He bringeth to them."
19078030,19,78,30,"They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet `is' their food in their mouth,"
19078031,19,78,31,"And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to bend."
19078032,19,78,32,"With all this they have sinned again, And have not believed in His wonders."
19078033,19,78,33,"And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble."
19078034,19,78,34,"If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,"
19078035,19,78,35,"And they remember that God `is' their rock, And God Most High their redeemer."
19078036,19,78,36,"And -- they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,"
19078037,19,78,37,"And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant."
19078038,19,78,38,"And He -- the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury."
19078039,19,78,39,"And He remembereth that they `are' flesh, A wind going on -- and it returneth not."
19078040,19,78,40,"How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?"
19078041,19,78,41,"Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of Israel have limited."
19078042,19,78,42,They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.
19078043,19,78,43,"When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,"
19078044,19,78,44,"And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not."
19078045,19,78,45,"He sendeth among them the beetle, and it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,"
19078046,19,78,46,"And giveth to the caterpillar their increase, And their labour to the locust."
19078047,19,78,47,"He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores with frost,"
19078048,19,78,48,"And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames."
19078049,19,78,49,"He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress -- A discharge of evil messengers."
19078050,19,78,50,"He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered up."
19078051,19,78,51,"And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham."
19078052,19,78,52,"And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,"
19078053,19,78,53,"And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered."
19078054,19,78,54,"And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,"
19078055,19,78,55,"And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,"
19078056,19,78,56,"And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept."

19109027,19,109,27,"And they know that this `is' Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it."
19109028,19,109,28,"They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice."
19109029,19,109,29,"Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe `is' their shame."

20001002,20,1,2,"For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,"
20001003,20,1,3,"For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,"
20001004,20,1,4,"For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion."
20001005,20,1,5,"(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)"

20001007,20,1,7,"Fear of Jehovah `is' a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!"
20001008,20,1,8,"Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,"

20001010,20,1,10,"My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing."
20001011,20,1,11,"If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,"

20001022,20,1,22,"`Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?"
20001023,20,1,23,"Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you."
20001024,20,1,24,"Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,"

20001030,20,1,30,"They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,"
20001031,20,1,31,"And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled."
20001032,20,1,32,"For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them."

20002017,20,2,17,"Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten."
20002018,20,2,18,"For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths."
20002019,20,2,19,"None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life."
20002020,20,2,20,"That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep."
20002021,20,2,21,"For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,"

20003009,20,3,9,"Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;"
20003010,20,3,10,"And filled are thy barns `with' plenty, And `with' new wine thy presses break forth."
20003011,20,3,11,"Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,"
20003012,20,3,12,"For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with."
20003013,20,3,13,"O the happiness of a man `who' hath found wisdom, And of a man `who' bringeth forth understanding."

20003031,20,3,31,"Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways."
20003032,20,3,32,"For an abomination to Jehovah `is' the perverted, And with the upright `is' His secret counsel."
20003033,20,3,33,The curse of Jehovah `is' in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.
20003034,20,3,34,"If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace."
20003035,20,3,35,"Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!"
20004001,20,4,1,"Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding."
20004002,20,4,2,"For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not."
20004003,20,4,3,"For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only one before my mother."
20004004,20,4,4,"And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live."

20004014,20,4,14,"Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers."
20004015,20,4,15,"Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on."
20004016,20,4,16,"For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not `some' to stumble."
20004017,20,4,17,"For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink."
20004018,20,4,18,"And the path of the righteous `is' as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,"
20004019,20,4,19,"The way of the wicked `is' as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble."
20004020,20,4,20,"My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,"
20004021,20,4,21,"Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart."
20004022,20,4,22,"For life they `are' to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing."
20004023,20,4,23,"Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it `are' the outgoings of life."
20004024,20,4,24,"Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,"
20004025,20,4,25,"Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee."
20004026,20,4,26,"Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways `are' established."
20004027,20,4,27,"Incline not `to' the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!"
20005001,20,5,1,"My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,"
20005002,20,5,2,"To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep."
20005003,20,5,3,"For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil `is' her mouth,"
20005004,20,5,4,"And her latter end `is' bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword `with' mouths."
20005005,20,5,5,"Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of."
20005006,20,5,6,"The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths -- thou knowest not."
20005007,20,5,7,"And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth."
20005008,20,5,8,"Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,"
20005009,20,5,9,"Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,"
20005010,20,5,10,"Lest strangers be filled `with' thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,"
20005011,20,5,11,"And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,"
20005012,20,5,12,"And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,"
20005013,20,5,13,"And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear."
20005014,20,5,14,"As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company."
20005015,20,5,15,"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well."
20005016,20,5,16,"Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters."
20005017,20,5,17,"Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee."
20005018,20,5,18,"Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,"
20005019,20,5,19,"A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually."
20005020,20,5,20,"And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?"
20005021,20,5,21,"For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering."
20005022,20,5,22,"His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden."
20005023,20,5,23,"He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!"
20006001,20,6,1,"My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,"
20006002,20,6,2,"Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,"
20006003,20,6,3,"Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,"
20006004,20,6,4,"Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,"
20006005,20,6,5,"Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler."
20006006,20,6,6,"Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;"
20006007,20,6,7,"Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,"
20006008,20,6,8,"She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food."
20006009,20,6,9,"Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?"
20006010,20,6,10,"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,"
20006011,20,6,11,"And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man."
20006012,20,6,12,"A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking `with' perverseness of mouth,"
20006013,20,6,13,"Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,"

21001017,21,1,17,"And I give my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I have known that even this `is' vexation of spirit;"
21001018,21,1,18,"for, in abundance of wisdom `is' abundance of sadness, and he who addeth knowledge addeth pain.'"
21002001,21,2,1,"I said in my heart, `Pray, come, I try thee with mirth, and look thou on gladness;' and lo, even it `is' vanity."
21002002,21,2,2,"Of laughter I said, `Foolish!' and of mirth, `What `is' this it is doing?'"
21002003,21,2,3,"I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite, (and my heart leading in wisdom), and to take hold on folly till that I see where `is' this -- the good to the sons of man of that which they do under the heavens, the number of the days of their lives."
21002004,21,2,4,"I made great my works, I builded for me houses, I planted for me vineyards."
21002005,21,2,5,"I made for me gardens and paradises, and I planted in them trees of every fruit."
21002006,21,2,6,"I made for me pools of water, to water from them a forest shooting forth trees."
21002007,21,2,7,"I got men-servants, and maid-servants, and sons of the house were to me; also, I had much substance -- herd and flock -- above all who had been before me in Jerusalem."
21002008,21,2,8,"I gathered for me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. I prepared for me men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of man -- a wife and wives."
21002009,21,2,9,"And I became great, and increased above every one who had been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me."
21002010,21,2,10,"And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from all my labour,"
21002011,21,2,11,"and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done, and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole `is' vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun!"
21002012,21,2,12,"And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but what `is' the man who cometh after the king? that which `is' already -- they have done it!"
21002013,21,2,13,"And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom above folly, like the advantage of the light above the darkness."
21002014,21,2,14,"The wise! -- his eyes `are' in his head, and the fool in darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth with them all;"
21002015,21,2,15,"and I said in my heart, `As it happeneth with the fool, it happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?' And I spake in my heart, that also this `is' vanity:"
21002016,21,2,16,"That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool -- to the age, for that which `is' already, `in' the days that are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the fool!"
21002017,21,2,17,"And I have hated life, for sad to me `is' the work that hath been done under the sun, for the whole `is' vanity and vexation of spirit."
21002018,21,2,18,"And I have hated all my labour that I labour at under the sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me."
21002019,21,2,19,"And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I have done wisely under the sun! this also `is' vanity."
21002020,21,2,20,And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour that I laboured at under the sun.
21002021,21,2,21,"For there is a man whose labour `is' in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured therein he giveth it -- his portion! Even this `is' vanity and a great evil."
21002022,21,2,22,"For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun?"
21002023,21,2,23,"For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even at night his heart hath not lain down; this also `is' vanity."
21002024,21,2,24,"There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk, and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have seen that it `is' from the hand of God."
21002025,21,2,25,For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?
21002026,21,2,26,"For to a man who `is' good before Him, He hath given wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before God. Even this `is' vanity and vexation of spirit."
21003001,21,3,1,"To everything -- a season, and a time to every delight under the heavens:"
21003002,21,3,2,"A time to bring forth, And a time to die. A time to plant, And a time to eradicate the planted."
21003003,21,3,3,"A time to slay, And a time to heal, A time to break down, And a time to build up."
21003004,21,3,4,"A time to weep, And a time to laugh. A time to mourn, And a time to skip."
21003005,21,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, And a time to heap up stones. A time to embrace, And a time to be far from embracing."
21003006,21,3,6,"A time to seek, And a time to destroy. A time to keep, And a time to cast away."
21003007,21,3,7,"A time to rend, And a time to sew. A time to be silent, And a time to speak."
21003008,21,3,8,"A time to love, And a time to hate. A time of war, And a time of peace."
21003009,21,3,9,What advantage hath the doer in that which he is labouring at?
21003010,21,3,10,I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of man to be humbled by it.
21003011,21,3,11,"The whole He hath made beautiful in its season; also, that knowledge He hath put in their heart without which man findeth not out the work that God hath done from the beginning even unto the end."
21003012,21,3,12,"I have known that there is no good for them except to rejoice and to do good during their life,"
21003013,21,3,13,"yea, even every man who eateth and hath drunk and seen good by all his labour, it `is' a gift of God."
21003014,21,3,14,"I have known that all that God doth is to the age, to it nothing is to be added, and from it nothing is to be withdrawn; and God hath wrought that they do fear before Him."
21003015,21,3,15,"What is that which hath been? already it is, and that which `is' to be hath already been, and God requireth that which is pursued."
21003016,21,3,16,"And again, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment -- there `is' the wicked; and the place of righteousness -- there `is' the wicked."
21003017,21,3,17,"I said in my heart, `The righteous and the wicked doth God judge, for a time `is' to every matter and for every work there.'"
21003018,21,3,18,"I said in my heart concerning the matter of the sons of man that God might cleanse them, so as to see that they themselves `are' beasts."
21003019,21,3,19,"For an event `is to' the sons of man, and an event `is to' the beasts, even one event `is' to them; as the death of this, so `is' the death of that; and one spirit `is' to all, and the advantage of man above the beast is nothing, for the whole `is' vanity."
21003020,21,3,20,"The whole are going unto one place, the whole have been from the dust, and the whole are turning back unto the dust."
21003021,21,3,21,"Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that is going up on high, and the spirit of the beast that is going down below to the earth?"
21003022,21,3,22,"And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man rejoice in his works, for it `is' his portion; for who doth bring him in to look on that which is after him?"
21004001,21,4,1,"And I have turned, and I see all the oppressions that are done under the sun, and lo, the tear of the oppressed, and they have no comforter; and at the hand of their oppressors `is' power, and they have no comforter."
21004002,21,4,2,And I am praising the dead who have already died above the living who are yet alive.
21004003,21,4,3,"And better than both of them `is' he who hath not yet been, in that he hath not seen the evil work that hath been done under the sun."
21004004,21,4,4,"And I have seen all the labour, and all the benefit of the work, because for it a man is the envy of his neighbour. Even this `is' vanity and vexation of spirit."
21004005,21,4,5,"The fool is clasping his hands, and eating his own flesh:"
21004006,21,4,6,"`Better `is' a handful `with' quietness, than two handfuls `with' labour and vexation of spirit.'"
21004007,21,4,7,"And I have turned, and I see a vain thing under the sun:"
21004008,21,4,8,"There is one, and there is not a second; even son or brother he hath not, and there is no end to all his labour! His eye also is not satisfied with riches, and `he saith not', `For whom am I labouring and bereaving my soul of good?' This also is vanity, it is a sad travail."
21004009,21,4,9,"The two `are' better than the one, in that they have a good reward by their labour."
21004010,21,4,10,"For if they fall, the one raiseth up his companion, but wo to the one who falleth and there is not a second to raise him up!"
21004011,21,4,11,"Also, if two lie down, then they have heat, but how hath one heat?"
21004012,21,4,12,"And if the one strengthen himself, the two stand against him; and the threefold cord is not hastily broken."
21004013,21,4,13,"Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who hath not known to be warned any more."
21004014,21,4,14,"For from a house of prisoners he hath come out to reign, for even in his own kingdom he hath been poor."
21004015,21,4,15,"I have seen all the living, who are walking under the sun, with the second youth who doth stand in his place;"
21004016,21,4,16,"there is no end to all the people, to all who were before them; also, the latter rejoice not in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit."
21005001,21,5,1,"Keep thy feet when thou goest unto a house of God, and draw near to hear rather than to give of fools the sacrifice, for they do not know they do evil."
21005002,21,5,2,"Cause not thy mouth to hasten, and let not thy heart hasten to bring out a word before God, for God is in the heavens, and thou on the earth, therefore let thy words be few."
21005003,21,5,3,"For the dream hath come by abundance of business, and the voice of a fool by abundance of words."
21005004,21,5,4,"When thou vowest a vow to God, delay not to complete it, for there is no pleasure in fools; that which thou vowest -- complete."
21005005,21,5,5,"Better that thou do not vow, than that thou dost vow and dost not complete."
21005006,21,5,6,"Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say before the messenger, that `it `is' an error,' why is God wroth because of thy voice, and hath destroyed the work of thy hands?"
21005007,21,5,7,"For, in the abundance of dreams both vanities and words abound; but fear thou God."
21005008,21,5,8,"If oppression of the poor, and violent taking away of judgment and righteousness thou seest in a province, do not marvel at the matter, for a higher than the high is observing, and high ones `are' over them."
21005009,21,5,9,And the abundance of a land is for all. A king for a field is served.
21005010,21,5,10,"Whoso is loving silver is not satisfied `with' silver, nor he who is in love with stores `with' increase. Even this `is' vanity."
21005011,21,5,11,"In the multiplying of good have its consumers been multiplied, and what benefit `is' to its possessor except the sight of his eyes?"
21005012,21,5,12,Sweet `is' the sleep of the labourer whether he eat little or much; and the sufficiency of the wealthy is not suffering him to sleep.
21005013,21,5,13,"There is a painful evil I have seen under the sun: wealth kept for its possessor, for his evil."
21005014,21,5,14,"And that wealth hath been lost in an evil business, and he hath begotten a son and there is nothing in his hand!"
21005015,21,5,15,"As he came out from the belly of his mother, naked he turneth back to go as he came, and he taketh not away anything of his labour, that doth go in his hand."
21005016,21,5,16,"And this also `is' a painful evil, just as he came, so he goeth, and what advantage `is' to him who laboureth for wind?"
21005017,21,5,17,"Also all his days in darkness he consumeth, and sadness, and wrath, and sickness abound."
21005018,21,5,18,"Lo, that which I have seen: `It is' good, because beautiful, to eat, and to drink, and to see good in all one's labour that he laboureth at under the sun, the number of the days of his life that God hath given to him, for it `is' his portion."
21005019,21,5,19,"Every man also to whom God hath given wealth and riches, and hath given him power to eat of it, and to accept his portion, and to rejoice in his labour, this is a gift of God."
21005020,21,5,20,"For he doth not much remember the days of his life, for God is answering through the joy of his heart."
21006001,21,6,1,"There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it `is' great on man:"
21006002,21,6,2,"A man to whom God giveth wealth, and riches, and honour, and there is no lack to his soul of all that he desireth, and God giveth him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eateth it; this `is' vanity, and it `is' an evil disease."
21006003,21,6,3,"If a man doth beget a hundred, and live many years, and is great, because they are the days of his years, and his soul is not satisfied from the goodness, and also he hath not had a grave, I have said, `Better than he `is' the untimely birth.'"
21006004,21,6,4,"For in vanity he came in, and in darkness he goeth, and in darkness his name is covered,"
21006005,21,6,5,"Even the sun he hath not seen nor known, more rest hath this than that."
21006006,21,6,6,"And though he had lived a thousand years twice over, yet good he hath not seen; to the same place doth not every one go?"
21006007,21,6,7,"All the labour of man `is' for his mouth, and yet the soul is not filled."
21006008,21,6,8,For what advantage `is' to the wise above the fool? What to the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?
21006009,21,6,9,Better `is' the sight of the eyes than the going of the soul. This also `is' vanity and vexation of spirit.
21006010,21,6,10,"What `is' that which hath been? already is its name called, and it is known that it `is' man, and he is not able to contend with him who is stronger than he."
21006011,21,6,11,For there are many things multiplying vanity; what advantage `is' to man?
21006012,21,6,12,"For who knoweth what `is' good for a man in life, the number of the days of the life of his vanity, and he maketh them as a shadow? for who declareth to man what is after him under the sun?"
21007001,21,7,1,"Better `is' a name than good perfume, And the day of death than the day of birth."
21007002,21,7,2,"Better to go unto a house of mourning, Than to go unto a house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the living layeth `it' unto his heart."
21007003,21,7,3,"Better `is' sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the face the heart becometh better."
21007004,21,7,4,"The heart of the wise `is' in a house of mourning, And the heart of fools in a house of mirth."
21007005,21,7,5,"Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than `for' a man to hear a song of fools,"
21007006,21,7,6,"For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So `is' the laughter of a fool, even this `is' vanity."
21007007,21,7,7,"Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth the heart."
21007008,21,7,8,"Better `is' the latter end of a thing than its beginning, Better `is' the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit."
21007009,21,7,9,"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the bosom of fools resteth."
21007010,21,7,10,"Say not thou, `What was it, That the former days were better than these?' For thou hast not asked wisely of this."
21007011,21,7,11,"Wisdom `is' good with an inheritance, And an advantage `it is' to those beholding the sun."
21007012,21,7,12,"For wisdom `is' a defense, money `is' a defence, And the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom `is', She reviveth her possessors."
21007013,21,7,13,"See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that which He made crooked?"
21007014,21,7,14,"In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the intent that man doth not find anything after him."
21007015,21,7,15,"The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is a wrong-doer prolonging `himself' in his wrong."
21007016,21,7,16,"Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art thou desolate?"
21007017,21,7,17,"Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou die within thy time?"
21007018,21,7,18,"`It is' good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also, from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God goeth out with them all."
21007019,21,7,19,"The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth the rulers who have been in a city."
21007020,21,7,20,Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth good and sinneth not.
21007021,21,7,21,"Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart, that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee."
21007022,21,7,22,For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself also hast reviled others.
21007023,21,7,23,"All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, `I am wise,' and it `is' far from me."
21007024,21,7,24,"Far off `is' that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth find it?"
21007025,21,7,25,"I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of folly, and of foolishness the madness."
21007026,21,7,26,"And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose heart `is' nets and snares, her hands `are' bands; the good before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by her."
21007027,21,7,27,"See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to find out the reason"
21007028,21,7,28,"(that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I have not found."
21007029,21,7,29,"See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright, and they -- they have sought out many devices."
21008001,21,8,1,"Who `is' as the wise? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? The wisdom of man causeth his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed."
21008002,21,8,2,"I pray thee, the commandment of a king keep, even for the sake of the oath of God."
21008003,21,8,3,"Be not troubled at his presence, thou mayest go, stand not in an evil thing, for all that he pleaseth he doth."
21008004,21,8,4,"Where the word of a king `is' power `is', and who saith to him, `What dost thou?'"
21008005,21,8,5,"Whoso is keeping a command knoweth no evil thing, and time and judgment the heart of the wise knoweth."
21008006,21,8,6,"For to every delight there is a time and a judgment, for the misfortune of man is great upon him."
21008007,21,8,7,"For he knoweth not that which shall be, for when it shall be who declareth to him?"
21008008,21,8,8,"There is no man ruling over the spirit to restrain the spirit, and there is no authority over the day of death, and there is no discharge in battle, and wickedness delivereth not its possessors."
21008009,21,8,9,All this I have seen so as to give my heart to every work that hath been done under the sun; a time that man hath ruled over man to his own evil.
21008010,21,8,10,"And so I have seen the wicked buried, and they went in, even from the Holy Place they go, and they are forgotten in the city whether they had so done. This also `is' vanity."
21008011,21,8,11,"Because sentence hath not been done `on' an evil work speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of man is full within them to do evil."
21008012,21,8,12,"Though a sinner is doing evil a hundred `times', and prolonging `himself' for it, surely also I know that there is good to those fearing God, who fear before Him."
21008013,21,8,13,"And good is not to the wicked, and he doth not prolong days as a shadow, because he is not fearing before God."
21008014,21,8,14,"There is a vanity that hath been done upon the earth, that there are righteous ones unto whom it is coming according to the work of the wicked, and there are wicked ones unto whom it is coming according to the work of the righteous. I have said that this also `is' vanity."
21008015,21,8,15,"And I have praised mirth because there is no good to man under the sun except to eat and to drink, and to rejoice, and it remaineth with him of his labour the days of his life that God hath given to him under the sun."
21008016,21,8,16,"When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that hath been done on the earth, (for there is also a spectator in whose eyes sleep is not by day and by night),"
21008017,21,8,17,"then I considered all the work of God, that man is not able to find out the work that hath been done under the sun, because though man labour to seek, yet he doth not find; and even though the wise man speak of knowing he is not able to find."
21009001,21,9,1,"But all this I have laid unto my heart, so as to clear up the whole of this, that the righteous and the wise, and their works, `are' in the hand of God, neither love nor hatred doth man know, the whole `is' before them."
21009002,21,9,2,"The whole `is' as to the whole; one event is to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean, and to him who is sacrificing, and to him who is not sacrificing; as `is' the good, so `is' the sinner, he who is swearing as he who is fearing an oath."
21009003,21,9,3,"This `is' an evil among all that hath been done under the sun, that one event `is' to all, and also the heart of the sons of man is full of evil, and madness `is' in their heart during their life, and after it -- unto the dead."
21009004,21,9,4,"But `to' him who is joined unto all the living there is confidence, for to a living dog it `is' better than to the dead lion."
21009005,21,9,5,"For the living know that they die, and the dead know not anything, and there is no more to them a reward, for their remembrance hath been forgotten."
21009006,21,9,6,"Their love also, their hatred also, their envy also, hath already perished, and they have no more a portion to the age in all that hath been done under the sun."
21009007,21,9,7,"Go, eat with joy thy bread, and drink with a glad heart thy wine, for already hath God been pleased with thy works."
21009008,21,9,8,"At all times let thy garments be white, and let not perfume be lacking on thy head."
21009009,21,9,9,"See life with the wife whom thou hast loved, all the days of the life of thy vanity, that He hath given to thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity, for it `is' thy portion in life, even of thy labour that thou art labouring at under the sun."
21009010,21,9,10,"All that thy hand findeth to do, with thy power do, for there is no work, and device, and knowledge, and wisdom in Sheol whither thou art going."
21009011,21,9,11,"I have turned so as to see under the sun, that not to the swift `is' the race, nor to the mighty the battle, nor even to the wise bread, nor even to the intelligent wealth, nor even to the skilful grace, for time and chance happen with them all."
21009012,21,9,12,"For even man knoweth not his time; as fish that are taken hold of by an evil net, and as birds that are taken hold of by a snare, like these `are' the sons of man snared at an evil time, when it falleth upon them suddenly."
21009013,21,9,13,"This also I have seen: wisdom under the sun, and it is great to me."
21009014,21,9,14,"A little city, and few men in it, and a great king hath come unto it, and hath surrounded it, and hath built against it great bulwarks;"
21009015,21,9,15,"and there hath been found in it a poor wise man, and he hath delivered the city by his wisdom, and men have not remembered that poor man!"
21009016,21,9,16,"And I said, `Better `is' wisdom than might, and the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.' --"
21009017,21,9,17,"The words of the wise in quiet are heard, More than the cry of a ruler over fools."
21009018,21,9,18,"Better `is' wisdom than weapons of conflict, And one sinner destroyeth much good!"
21010001,21,10,1,Dead flies cause a perfumer's perfume To send forth a stink; The precious by reason of wisdom -- By reason of honour -- a little folly!
21010002,21,10,2,"The heart of the wise `is' at his right hand, And the heart of a fool at his left."
21010003,21,10,3,"And also, when he that is a fool Is walking in the way, his heart is lacking, And he hath said to every one, `He `is' a fool.'"
21010004,21,10,4,"If the spirit of the ruler go up against thee, Thy place leave not, For yielding quieteth great sinners."
21010005,21,10,5,"There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error that goeth out from the ruler,"
21010006,21,10,6,"He hath set the fool in many high places, And the rich in a low place do sit."
21010007,21,10,7,"I have seen servants on horses, And princes walking as servants on the earth."
21010008,21,10,8,"Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And whoso is breaking a hedge, a serpent biteth him."
21010009,21,10,9,"Whoso is removing stones is grieved by them, Whoso is cleaving trees endangered by them."
21010010,21,10,10,"If the iron hath been blunt, And he the face hath not sharpened, Then doth he increase strength, And wisdom `is' advantageous to make right."
21010011,21,10,11,"If the serpent biteth without enchantment, Then there is no advantage to a master of the tongue."
21010012,21,10,12,"Words of the mouth of the wise `are' gracious, And the lips of a fool swallow him up."
21010013,21,10,13,"The beginning of the words of his mouth `is' folly, And the latter end of his mouth `Is' mischievous madness."
21010014,21,10,14,"And the fool multiplieth words: `Man knoweth not that which is, And that which is after him, who doth declare to him?'"
21010015,21,10,15,"The labour of the foolish wearieth him, In that he hath not known to go unto the city."
21010016,21,10,16,"Wo to thee, O land, when thy king `is' a youth, And thy princes do eat in the morning."
21010017,21,10,17,"Happy art thou, O land, When thy king `is' a son of freemen, And thy princes do eat in due season, For might, and not for drunkenness."
21010018,21,10,18,"By slothfulness is the wall brought low, And by idleness of the hands doth the house drop."
21010019,21,10,19,"For mirth they are making a feast, And wine maketh life joyful, And the silver answereth with all."
21010020,21,10,20,"Even in thy mind a king revile not, And in the inner parts of thy bed-chamber Revile not the rich: For a fowl of the heavens causeth the voice to go, And a possessor of wings declareth the word."
21011001,21,11,1,"Send forth thy bread on the face of the waters, For in the multitude of the days thou dost find it."
21011002,21,11,2,"Give a portion to seven, and even to eight, For thou knowest not what evil is on the earth."
21011003,21,11,3,"If the thick clouds are full of rain, On the earth they empty `themselves'; And if a tree doth fall in the south or to the north, The place where the tree falleth, there it is."
21011004,21,11,4,"Whoso is observing the wind soweth not, And whoso is looking on the thick clouds reapeth not."
21011005,21,11,5,"As thou knowest not what `is' the way of the spirit, How -- bones in the womb of the full one, So thou knowest not the work of God who maketh the whole."
21011006,21,11,6,"In the morning sow thy seed, And at even withdraw not thy hand, For thou knowest not which is right, this or that, Or whether both of them alike `are' good."
21011007,21,11,7,"Sweet also `is' the light, And good for the eyes to see the sun."
21011008,21,11,8,"But, if man liveth many years, In all of them let him rejoice, And remember the days of darkness, For they are many! all that is coming `is' vanity."
21011009,21,11,9,"Rejoice, O young man, in thy childhood, And let thy heart gladden thee in days of thy youth, And walk in the ways of thy heart, And in the sight of thine eyes, And know thou that for all these, Doth God bring thee into judgment."
21011010,21,11,10,"And turn aside anger from thy heart, And cause evil to pass from thy flesh, For the childhood and the age `are' vanity!"
21012001,21,12,1,"Remember also thy Creators in days of thy youth, While that the evil days come not, Nor the years have arrived, that thou sayest, `I have no pleasure in them.'"
21012002,21,12,2,"While that the sun is not darkened, and the light, And the moon, and the stars, And the thick clouds returned after the rain."
21012003,21,12,3,"In the day that keepers of the house tremble, And men of strength have bowed themselves, And grinders have ceased, because they have become few. And those looking out at the windows have become dim,"
21012004,21,12,4,"And doors have been shut in the street. When the noise of the grinding is low, And `one' riseth at the voice of the bird, And all daughters of song are bowed down."
21012005,21,12,5,"Also of that which is high they are afraid, And of the low places in the way, And the almond-tree is despised, And the grasshopper is become a burden, And want is increased, For man is going unto his home age-during, And the mourners have gone round through the street."
21012006,21,12,6,"While that the silver cord is not removed, And the golden bowl broken, And the pitcher broken by the fountain, And the wheel broken at the well."
21012007,21,12,7,"And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, And the spirit returneth to God who gave it."
21012008,21,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, said the preacher, the whole `is' vanity."
21012009,21,12,9,"And further, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge, and gave ear, and sought out -- he made right many similes."
21012010,21,12,10,"The preacher sought to find out pleasing words, and, written `by' the upright, words of truth."
21012011,21,12,11,"Words of the wise `are' as goads, and as fences planted `by' the masters of collections, they have been given by one shepherd."
21012012,21,12,12,"And further, from these, my son, be warned; the making of many books hath no end, and much study `is' a weariness of the flesh."
21012013,21,12,13,"The end of the whole matter let us hear: -- `Fear God, and keep His commands, for this `is' the whole of man."
21012014,21,12,14,"For every work doth God bring into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether good or bad.'"
22001001,22,1,1,"The Song of Songs, that `is' Solomon's."
22001002,22,1,2,"Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, For better `are' thy loves than wine."
22001003,22,1,3,"For fragrance `are' thy perfumes good. Perfume emptied out -- thy name, Therefore have virgins loved thee!"
22001004,22,1,4,"Draw me: after thee we run, The king hath brought me into his inner chambers, We do joy and rejoice in thee, We mention thy loves more than wine, Uprightly they have loved thee!"
22001005,22,1,5,"Dark `am' I, and comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As tents of Kedar, as curtains of Solomon."
22001006,22,1,6,"Fear me not, because I `am' very dark, Because the sun hath scorched me, The sons of my mother were angry with me, They made me keeper of the vineyards, My vineyard -- my own -- I have not kept."
22001007,22,1,7,"Declare to me, thou whom my soul hath loved, Where thou delightest, Where thou liest down at noon, For why am I as one veiled, By the ranks of thy companions?"
22001008,22,1,8,"If thou knowest not, O fair among women, Get thee forth by the traces of the flock, And feed thy kids by the shepherds' dwellings!"
22001009,22,1,9,"To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared thee, my friend,"
22001010,22,1,10,"Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands, Thy neck with chains."
22001011,22,1,11,"Garlands of gold we do make for thee, With studs of silver!"
22001012,22,1,12,"While the king `is' in his circle, My spikenard hath given its fragrance."
22001013,22,1,13,"A bundle of myrrh `is' my beloved to me, Between my breasts it lodgeth."
22001014,22,1,14,"A cluster of cypress `is' my beloved to me, In the vineyards of En-Gedi!"
22001015,22,1,15,"Lo, thou `art' fair, my friend, Lo, thou `art' fair, thine eyes `are' doves!"
22001016,22,1,16,"Lo, thou `art' fair, my love, yea, pleasant, Yea, our couch `is' green,"
22001017,22,1,17,"The beams of our houses `are' cedars, Our rafters `are' firs, I `am' a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys!"
22002001,22,2,1,"As a lily among the thorns,"
22002002,22,2,2,So `is' my friend among the daughters!
22002003,22,2,3,"As a citron among trees of the forest, So `is' my beloved among the sons, In his shade I delighted, and sat down, And his fruit `is' sweet to my palate."
22002004,22,2,4,"He hath brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner over me `is' love,"
22002005,22,2,5,"Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I `am' sick with love."
22002006,22,2,6,"His left hand `is' under my head, And his right doth embrace me."
22002007,22,2,7,"I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!"
22002008,22,2,8,"The voice of my beloved! lo, this -- he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills."
22002009,22,2,9,"My beloved `is' like to a roe, Or to a young one of the harts. Lo, this -- he is standing behind our wall, Looking from the windows, Blooming from the lattice."
22002010,22,2,10,"My beloved hath answered and said to me, `Rise up, my friend, my fair one, and come away,"
22002011,22,2,11,"For lo, the winter hath passed by, The rain hath passed away -- it hath gone."
22002012,22,2,12,"The flowers have appeared in the earth, The time of the singing hath come, And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land,"
22002013,22,2,13,"The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs, And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my friend, my fair one, yea, come away."
22002014,22,2,14,"My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the ascent, Cause me to see thine appearance, Cause me to hear thy voice, For thy voice `is' sweet, and thy appearance comely."
22002015,22,2,15,"Seize ye for us foxes, Little foxes -- destroyers of vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards."
22002016,22,2,16,"My beloved `is' mine, and I `am' his, Who is delighting among the lilies,"
22002017,22,2,17,"Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of the harts, On the mountains of separation!"
22003001,22,3,1,"On my couch by night, I sought him whom my soul hath loved; I sought him, and I found him not!"
22003002,22,3,2,"-- Pray, let me rise, and go round the city, In the streets and in the broad places, I seek him whom my soul hath loved! -- I sought him, and I found him not."
22003003,22,3,3,"The watchmen have found me, (Who are going round about the city), `Him whom my soul have loved saw ye?'"
22003004,22,3,4,"But a little I passed on from them, Till I found him whom my soul hath loved! I seized him, and let him not go, Till I brought him in unto the house of my mother -- And the chamber of her that conceived me."
22003005,22,3,5,"I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!"
22003006,22,3,6,"Who `is' this coming up from the wilderness, Like palm-trees of smoke, Perfumed `with' myrrh and frankincense, From every powder of the merchant?"
22003007,22,3,7,"Lo, his couch, that `is' Solomon's, Sixty mighty ones `are' around it, Of the mighty of Israel,"
22003008,22,3,8,"All of them holding sword, taught of battle, Each his sword by his thigh, for fear at night."
22003009,22,3,9,"A palanquin king Solomon made for himself, Of the wood of Lebanon,"
22003010,22,3,10,"Its pillars he made of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, Its midst lined `with' love, By the daughters of Jerusalem."
22003011,22,3,11,"Go forth, and look, ye daughters of Zion, On king Solomon, with the crown, With which his mother crowned him, In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the joy of his heart!"
22004001,22,4,1,"Lo, thou `art' fair, my friend, lo, thou `art' fair, Thine eyes `are' doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,"
22004002,22,4,2,"Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them."
22004003,22,4,3,"As a thread of scarlet `are' thy lips, And thy speech `is' comely, As the work of the pomegranate `is' thy temple behind thy veil,"
22004004,22,4,4,"As the tower of David `is' thy neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty."
22004005,22,4,5,"Thy two breasts `are' as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies."
22004006,22,4,6,"Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh
